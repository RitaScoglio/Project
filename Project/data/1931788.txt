==Plot==
Hannie Caulder (Welch) is a frontier wife whose husband is murdered by the Clemens brothers, a trio of rather inept outlaw brothers (played by Borgnine, Strother Martin, and Jack Elam).

After a disastrous bank raid, the Clemens men gang-rape Caulder, murder her husband, burn down her house, and leave her for dead. They go on a crime spree, while Caulder recruits professional bounty hunter Thomas Price (Culp) to help her seek revenge by training her to use a gun.

==Production==
Patrick Curtis, then married to Raquel Welch, met with Tony Tenser of Tigon British Films with a view to get funding for a movie starring Welch. He proposed a horror movie and a Western; Tenser, who had always wanted to make a Western, picked the latter.  Tigon put up 100% of the budget, Curtwel (Curtis and Welchs production company)put up their services.  Neither Curtis or Welch took a salary, instead taking profit participation. Before Hannie Caulder, , they co-produced, The Sorcerer, starring Boris Karloff, as a Curtwel/ Tigon Co- production. So, Tenser got both his western and horror film from Curtwel.
