Andy Warhols Frankenstein (original title: Flesh for Frankenstein) is a 1973 Italian-French horror film directed by Paul Morrissey and produced by Andy Warhol, Andrew Braunsberg, Louis Peraino and Carlo Ponti. It stars Udo Kier, Joe Dallesandro, Monique van Vooren and Arno Juerging. Interiors were filmed at Cinecittà in Rome by a crew of Italian filmmakers.
 3D process rated X by the MPAA due to its explicit sexuality and violence. A 3-D version also played in Australia in 1986, along with Blood for Dracula, its obvious pairing. In the 1970s, a 3-D version played in Stockholm, Sweden and in London, England. In subsequent US DVD releases, the film was retitled Flesh for Frankenstein, while the more popular title was used in other regions.

The gruesomeness of the action was intensified in the original release by the use of 3-D film|3-D, with several dismbowelments being shot from a perspective such that the internal organs are thrust towards the camera.  

== Plot ==
 sublimation of head donor Serbian shape.      

As it happens, a suitably randy farmhand, Nicholas, leaving a local brothel along with his sexually repressed friend, brought there in an unsuccessful attempt to dissuade him from entering a monastery, are spotted and waylaid by the doctor and his henchman, Otto; mistakenly assuming that the prospective monk is also suitable for stud duty, they take his head for use on the male creature. Not knowing these behind-the-scene details, Nicholas survives and is summoned by Katrin to the castle, where they form an agreement that he will gratify her unsatisfied carnal appetites.  

Under the control of the doctor, the male and female creatures are seated for dinner with the castles residents, but the male creature shows no signs of recognition of his friend as he serves the Baron and his family. Nicholas realizes at this point that something is awry, but himself pretends not to recognize his friends face until he can investigate further. After a falling-out with Katrin, who is merely concerned with her own needs, Nicholas goes snooping in the laboratory and is captured by the doctor. Frankenstein muses about using his new acquisition to replace the head of his creature, who is still showing no signs of libido. Nevertheless, Katrin is rewarded for betraying Nicholas by being granted use of the creature for erotic purposes, but is killed during a bout of overly vigorous copulation.

Meanwhile, Otto repeats the doctors sexual exploits with the female creature, resulting in her graphic disembowelment. The Baron returns and, enraged, does away with Otto. When he attempts to have the male creature eliminate Nicholas, however, the remnants of his friends personality rebel and the doctor is killed in gruesome fashion. The creature, believing he is better off dead, then disembowels himself. The doctors children, Erik and Monica, then enter the laboratory, pick up a pair of scalpels, and proceed to turn the wheel of the crane that is holding the farmhand in mid-air. It is not clear if the scalpels are there in order to release him, or take over where their father left off.

As a favor for producer Carlo Ponti, Margheriti agreed to take credits for free as director for the Italian release in order to help the film get funds from the government. Unfortunately, it ended up as a trial for producer and alleged director who both lost.

== Release ==
 
The film was later cut to 93 minutes for an R-rating, thereby increasing its viability for wider distribution. It was this version which was distributed for a 3-D re-release during the 3-D craze of the 1980s. 
The U.S. DVD releases have utilized the full uncut version, which is now unrated. The film had its television premiere in the United Kingdom on November 17, 2009 and was broadcast in 3D as part of Channel 4s 3D Week.

== Critical reception ==
 universal insensitivity, living-deadness and the inability to be turned on by anything short of the grotesque. However, this Frankenstein drags as much as it camps; despite a few amusing moments, it fails as a spoof, and the result is only a coy binge in degradation." 

Craig Butler of AllMovie called the film "a ramshackle affair, with performances that are ludicrously over-the-top and direction that is even more so, and a script that is filled with horrible dialogue. Not to mention, its a truly gross experience. Of course, many will appreciate it just for these qualities, either to laugh at how truly outrageous it all is or to marvel at the manner in which director/writer Paul Morrissey is skewering the very countercultural sex revolutionaries that were among his biggest fans, creating what is at heart a very conservative critique of hippie culture."  Ian Jane of DVD Talk said of the film, "Flesh for Frankenstein is a morbid and grotesque comedy that wont be to everyones taste but that does deliver some interesting humor and horror in that oddball way that Morrissey has." 

Andy Warhols Frankenstein currently holds a 91% fresh rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.
