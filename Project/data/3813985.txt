}} Italian film directed by Federico Fellini. It follows an Italian orchestra as the members go on strike against the conductor. The film was shown out of competition at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.   

Considered by some to be underrated    Orchestra Rehearsal was the last collaboration between composer Nino Rota and Fellini, due to Rotas death in 1979.
