Michael (Cameron Daddo), and Kate (Amy Sloan), are leading a group of teenagers for camping and through a science expedition. The students are Gwen, Jason, Willis (Steve Braun), and Angie (Mircea Monroe). They stop at a Turkish forest and begin exploring, eventually discovering a dead pterodactyl and mounds of pterodactyl feces. They move on, where suddently unknown to them a pterodactyl flies overhead. While the others examine the spore, Angie wanders off and decides to go for a swim. When she jumps into the water,  the same pterodactyl appears and attacks her. She struggles to escape, and runs into Jason, who was searching for Angie. In the confusion, he moves to the lake to investigate. Upon reaching the lake, the pterodactyl drags him away, and flies off. Angie tells the others that she was attacked by something that looked like a bird, but Michael dismisses the idea.

That night, Captain Bergen (Coolio) and his squad sneak into the Russian camp and captures the terrorist Clake, (Todd Kramer), by hand. Captain Bergen find Michael and his group camping, so they decide to follow them.
