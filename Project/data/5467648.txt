==Plot==
The film takes place in the Stone Age, where the leader (King) of the cave people declares that all the males between 13 and 99 years of age must find a female mate or face banishment. Ollie starts looking for a wife and in the scene it says "anyones will do" but is constantly clubbed on the head by the annoyed "husbands" Eventually Ollie finds an available girl but doesnt realise that Stan, with whom he has become friends is already intending to marry this girl. As both Stan and Ollie pursue the same girl, this eventually leads to several contests to win the affections of the young Blushing Rose.

==Production and distribution==
Although released in February 1928, Flying Elephants was actually filmed back in May 1927, before the duo were established as a world-famous comedy team. As a result, the film lacks the Laurel and Hardy trademarks and consists mostly of solo performances by the two comedians.
