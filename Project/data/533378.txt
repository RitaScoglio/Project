==Production== Manson Family at his house in Beverly Hills on the night of August 9, 1969. Following the murders, Polanski quit the film project he was working on, The Day of the Dolphin, and sank into deep psychological Depression (mood)|depression, blaming himself for the tragedy. After months of grieving Tates death, he set to adapting Shakespeares Macbeth with the aid of British theatre critic Kenneth Tynan.
 Hollywood studios senior VP nude Sleepwalking sleepwalking scene; however, Polanski and Tynan have said they had written the scene before their association with Hefner. British producer Andrew Braunsberg also provided financial support and executive guidance.

Macbeth was filmed in various locations around the British Isles. Parts of the film were shot in Snowdonia National Park, Gwynedd, in northwest Wales.   A considerable amount of shooting took place in Northumberland on the northeast coast of England, including Lindisfarne Castle, Bamburgh Castle and beach, St. Aidans Church and North Charlton Moors near Alnwick.    

The production suffered delays caused by chronic bad weather and malfunctioning special effects as well as by Polanskis own perfectionism and his stubborn insistence on shooting multiple takes of difficult and expensively mounted scenes on colour film stock. The shoot went over schedule, ultimately taking six months to complete and exceeded its $2.5 million budget by some $600,000. 

==Adaptation== soliloquies were changed to inner monologues for the sake of psychological realism. The film has a downbeat ending not present in the original: at the end, Donalbain is seen visiting the witches, presumably to repeat the cycle of usurpation.  

===Treatment of Ross=== opportunistic courtier and henchman who becomes a knowing accomplice in Macbeths schemes once Macbeth kills Duncan and attains the crown, but later betrays his master. Polanski and Tynan created this effect without giving Ross any lines not written by Shakespeare, or putting him anywhere that Shakespeare does not put him (except when he becomes the Third Murderer); rather the new characterization is effected through small directorial touches.
  Scone when he shouts "Hail Macbeth, King of Scotland!" in a very ostentatious manner, and this causes Banquo to look upon him with suspicion. Ironically, in the penultimate scene of the film, when the tables have finally turned, Ross removes the crown from the head of the slain Macbeth and presents it to the victorious Malcolm, loudly hailing the latter as the new king in precisely the same ostentatious manner as before. The implication is that Ross is totally unprincipled and self-seeking, and his only allegiance is to the one who holds the most power at any given time. 

In addition, there are several other notable departures from Shakespeares text with regard to Ross throughout the course of the film:  
* In the play, Macbeth has a conversation with an unidentified person who tells the king of  Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduffs refusal to present himself in the Scottish court. In the film, Macbeth is directly informed of this by Ross.
* In the play, the identity of the third assassin sent by Macbeth to kill Banquo is never specified by Shakespeare. Whereas, in the film, Ross is clearly the third murderer, sent by Macbeth separately from the first two murderers.  Not only that, but it is Ross who eventually dispatches the two hired villains in a dungeon when they have outlived their usefulness to the king.
* During the banquet scene when Banquos ghost appears and frightens Macbeth, the brief lines of dialogue each specifically attributed to Lennox and Ross in the play are spoken by exactly the opposite characters in the film—thus making Ross appear somewhat fawning and insincere in his stated concern for Macbeths health.
* In the play, Ross is apparently unaware of the slaughter of Macduffs household at Fife—even though he is the one who takes the news to Macduff claiming he heard about it from trustworthy sources. But in the film Ross is an active conspirator who has prior knowledge of the raid on Macduffs castle and deliberately leaves the doors wide open for the assassins to enter and massacre Macduffs family and servants.

Also, in the film, Ross eventually betrays Macbeth only because he is not honored with Macbeths former title of Thane of Cawdor, a rank symbolized by a ceremonial necklace which the king chooses to bestow upon Seyton instead.

==Technical style== atonal wails and drones of the Third Ear Band. As in his earlier Repulsion (1965), Polanski employs ominously unnatural silences and amplified sounds to create a sense of enveloping discomfort and dread.
 set piece montage imagery. surreal visual allegory of the eventual, dynastic triumph of Banquos heirs as each king is seen holding up a looking glass which contains the image of his successor. This mise en abyme effect is repeated eightfold until, ultimately, young Fleance is seen grinning and crowned in the final, eighth looking glass—an allusion to Shakespeares original stage direction that the last Banquo appear holding a looking glass, as well as the historical myth that King James I of England was descended from Banquo by eight generations.

==Reception==
Upon release in October 1971, Macbeth received mixed reviews. Some critics found the films graphic violence and nudity distracting, complaining that such blatancy and literalness diminished the complexity and ambiguity of the original text. Moreover, the single-minded bleakness and unrelenting brutality of Polanskis vision was faulted by less sympathetic commentators as being a crude and monotonous oversimplification of the play which, in  Pauline Kaels view, ultimately "reduces Shakespeares meanings to the banal theme of life is a jungle".   

Many were particularly disturbed by the lurid manner in which Polanski depicted the bloody slaughter of Macduffs wife and children.  Kael went so far as to say that Polanski seemed to stage the scene as a deliberate evocation of the Manson Murders.  
 Best Film of 1971.

The film was screened at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, but wasnt entered into the main competition.   

The film currently holds an 86% Fresh rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus "Roman Polanskis Macbeth is unsettling and uneven, but also undeniably compelling."
