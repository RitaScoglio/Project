Without Honor is a 1949 film noir directed by Irving Pichel and featuring Laraine Day and Dane Clark. 

==Plot==
A housewife (Day) is confronted during her daily chores by her married lover (Tone).  The man, after a long affair, tells the woman that he has to break off their relationship.  The woman threatens suicide, but when she picks up a shish kabob skewer, the two struggle and the man is stabbed in the chest and collapses.  The housewife hides the body in the house.  Before she can leave, her brother-in-law (Clark) arrives and tells the woman that he knows about the affair and that he has invited her husband, her lover and his wife to her house that evening so that he can tell them about the affair.  The woman, in a panic worrying that they will find out about the killing, attempts to flee but cannot get away from her vengeful brother-in-law.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Arthur Lions, in the book Death on the Cheap: The Lost B Movies of Film Noir, notes "A top-notch cast is wasted in a total clunker. The film takes the award, however, for the movie with the shortest performance by a top-billed star. Leading man Tone, after his brief initial appearance, spends most of the picture as the "corpse" in the laundry room." 

The film was entered into the 1949 Cannes Film Festival.
