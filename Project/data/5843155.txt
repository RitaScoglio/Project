==Plot==
George "Hotsy" Hamilton (George Gobel), a very eligible but naive vegetarian heir to a meat-packing fortune, returns home to Connecticut by luxury cruise ship, accompanied by Marty Kennedy (Harry Bellaver), his valet, guardian and best friend, after spending three years together on a scientific expedition in the Belgian Congo looking for a rare snake.  On board, the woman-shy George attracts a lot of attention from the opposite sex, despite being the consummate milque-toast, but the one he cant avoid is Jean Harris (Mitzi Gaynor), a beautiful con artist travelling with her equally larcenous father, Colonel Patrick Henry "Handsome Harry" Harris (David Niven), and his partner-in-crime Gerald (Reginald Gardiner).

The three con artists are out to fleece George of a small fortune, but even the best laid plans can go astray. First, Jean falls hard for George and shields him from her card sharp father. Then, when Marty discovers the truth about her and her father and tells George about them, he dumps her.  Furious at being scorned, she re-enters his life masquerading as the posh "Countess Louise", the cousin of "Jacques Duc de Montaigne" (Hans Conreid), who is actually Frenchie, another con man whos swindling the rich folks of Connecticut. Jean is determined to get back at George, so she sets out to seduce him, again.

Georges domineering father (Fred Clark) throws a party in honor of the visiting French royalty, and George is completely taken in by Jeans masquerade. Soon her hapless victim is so confused and bothered he doesnt know which way is up, but, in the end, after all the twists and turns, deceptions and lies, true love wins out.  Brennan, Sandra
