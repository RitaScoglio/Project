The Merchant of Venice received generally positive reviews, with a favourable rating of 72% at Rotten Tomatoes and an average score of 63/100 at Metacritic.

In 2005, the film had a Royal Premiere in the presence of Prince Charles and received a BAFTA nomination for Best Costume Design.

Its worldwide theatrical gross was about $21.3 million, with a production budget of $30 million.
