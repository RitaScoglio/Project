==Plot== Polish violinist from Krakow, Andrea is bound for America when he is swept overboard by a storm. When the Widdington sisters discover the handsome stranger on the beach below their house, they nurse him back to health. However, the presence of the musically talented young man disrupts the peaceful lives of Ursula and Janet and the community in which they live.

Holidaying artist Olga Daniloff, the sister of famed violinist Boris Daniloff, becomes interested in Andrea after hearing him play the violin. As time progresses, Olga and Andrea grow closer. Olga tells her brother of Andreas talent, and he asks to meet Andrea in London. Although Andrea cares deeply for the sisters, he knows this is his chance to start a career, and he leaves with Olga without saying goodbye to the women. He later sends them a letter, along with a portrait of himself painted by Olga, thanking them for saving his life. The sisters travel to London to attend Andreas first public performance, while the rest of the village listens in on the wireless.

== Reception == Best European Actress at the European Film Awards. Dench was nominated for the ALFS Award for British Actress of the Year by the London Film Critics Circle. The film was positively received by the critics.

In his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden said:
 grandes dames (usually English) making "grande" pronouncements, the world revolves around tea, gardening and misty watercolor memories.  

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film "perfectly sweet and civilized... Its a pleasure to watch Smith and Dench together; their acting is so natural it could be breathing." 

In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw observed that "despite a bit of shortbread-sugary emotion and an ending that fizzles out disappointingly, theres some nice period detail and decent lines in Charles Dances directing debut,"  while Philip French of The Observer commented on the "beautiful setting, a succession of implausible incidents, and characteristically excellent work from Smith (all suppression and stoicism) and Dench (exuding unfulfilled yearning)." 
 Boston Phoenix said, "This exercise in scenery and music is as innocuous as a nosegay." 

In the Chicago Tribune, Robert K. Elder awarded the film two out of a possible four stars and added:

   exemplifies that kind of polite, underdramatic Masterpiece Theatre staging that can either provide a surgical examination of English society or bore the pants off you. Ladies in Lavender does a bit of both... director Dances momentum fades soon after Andreas ankle mends, and were left with a vague back story involving Andreas intent to emigrate to America, though the mystery of how he ended up in Cornwall is never revisited nor revealed.   becomes sort of a blank character, a personality on whom we can impose our own curiosity and emotions... as compelling and original as this theme is, its not enough to keep our attention, no matter how lovely the ladies in lavender are."
