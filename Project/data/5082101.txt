==Production==
Producer Herman Cohen said he got the idea for the film after reading a series of newspaper articles about Scotland Yards Black Museum. He arranged through a contact to visit the museum, then wrote a treatment and later collaborated with Aben Kandel on the screenplay. Cohen says the use of binoculars as murder weapons, and all the other instruments of death in the film, were based on real life murder cases.

The credited producer was Jack Greenwood but Herman Cohen says this came about to ensure the film qualified for the Eady levy and in fact Greenwood was more of an associate producer assisting Cohen. 

Cohen wanted to hire Vincent Price for the lead and also considered Orson Welles but Anglo-Amalgamated pushed for a British actor in the lead as it would be cheaper, so they decided to use Michael Gough. Arthur Crabtree was hired on the basis of his work on Fiend Without a Face. ("The price was right and the old guy needed a job, and I hired him," recalled Cohen. "And he was exactly what I wanted and needed as a good craftsman." )

A thirteen-minute prologue featuring hypnotist Emile Franchele and HypnoVista was added for the US release by James H. Nicholson of AIP, who felt the movie needed another gimmick. Museum Due Here Aug. 12
