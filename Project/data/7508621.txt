}} John Curran. novel of the same title by W. Somerset Maugham. Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Toby Jones, Anthony Wong Chau Sang and Liev Schreiber appear in the leading roles.
 a 1934 film starring Greta Garbo and Herbert Marshall   and a 1957 version called The Seventh Sin with Bill Travers and Eleanor Parker.

==Plot== bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts ("only to get as far away from (her) mother as possible"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walters medical post in Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates.

Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wifes infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesnt accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly and he agrees, provided Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to her lover, Charles, despite earlier claiming his love for Kitty, declines to accept.

She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappily uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with a young Chinese woman in relative opulence.

Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be.

As Walters anger and Kittys unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter – in love with Kitty again – assures her it doesnt matter.

A cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are getting it under control, in part due to his finding a way to protect the water supply (as people still did not understand how it was transmitted), ailing refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.

Five years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter.  They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he could be the boys father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies "No one important".

==Production==

===Development=== feminist version. Mulholland Drive John Curran, marketing difficulties.   

Yari and Warner Independent Pictures collaborated with a Chinese partner who was granted approval over the script and the finished film. The partnership permitted a budget of $19 million for The Painted Veil. When the Chinese production company reviewed the film, it was unhappy with the depiction of the Chinese uprising and the cholera victims, requesting that the scenes be revised. Norton and Curran expressed concerns that their studio accepted the censorship too quickly, with the director threatening to remove his name from the film. Their pressure resulted in limiting cuts from the film to only 38 seconds worth. 

===Writing=== Out of The English Patient (1996), seeing it as "rooted in really looking at the way that men and women hurt each other". 
 John Curran Chinese nationalist movement were taking place. Norton, who had studied Chinese history at Yale University, agreed with the suggestion. To detail scenes from the time period, Curran, Norton, and Nyswaner relied on excerpts from historian Jonathan Spences 1969 book To Change China, which covered the inept efforts of Western advisers during these years. Norton described the character Walter Fane served as "the proxy for the arrogance of Western rationalism", explaining about Fanes confusion at the lack of gratitude for his help, "Walter means well, but hes the folly of empire, and that adds a whole new dimension to what happens in the story. Its a metaphor for the way empires get crushed." 

===Filming===
Filming took place on location in Shanghai, China. The director did not want to build a set for the cholera-stricken village, instead seeking out an untouched parcel of land in China. He found Huang Yao, which served as the location for the village. The director described the location, "Even the Chinese crew members were amazed at the place we found... It was like going back in time." According to Nyswaner, a large amount of time of the film production was spent negotiating with the Chinese government for the completion of the film, as there were disagreements over issues in the script.  Most of the film was shot in Guilin, Guangxi. Director John Curran commented, "We wanted this movie to be distinctly Chinese. We didn’t want it to look like a film that you could shoot in Canada or Mexico or Italy." After a search of location in Hunan province, the scouts chose the location in Guilin, Guangxi for the film.     Line producer Antonia Barnard states that initially the film, like the novel, was going to be set in Hong Kong, however the crew realized Hong Kong of the time period would be difficult to replicate, thus the story was altered so it would take place in Shanghai; the crew shot "Shanghai for Shanghai in the period, and shot London scenes in Shanghai as well."

==Marketing==
The films post-production schedule was initially slated to conclude in late summer 2006, but did not finish until November.  According to Laura Kim, the marketing and publicity head of Warner Independent Pictures, the delay slowed award and media recognition for the film. Other studios were duplicating DVDs of their films for awards organizations, so The Painted Veil was unable to get first priority in processing. When The Painted Veil experienced a limited release in the United States on December 20, 2006 in the cities Los Angeles and New York City, the meager marketing campaign for the film was criticized. The lack of attention caused a half dozen people associated with the film to complain about how Warner Independent Pictures was conducting the marketing campaign. Film critic Rex Reed of The New York Observer wrote, "Nobody can understand why Warner Independent Pictures is keeping this movie such a secret; it is filled with Oscar possibilities that should be shouted from the rooftops." 
 John Curran explained about the move to Warner Independent, "Any transition is not going to be ideal. When the guy who has gotten you on board is gone, youre kind of exposed." Others also criticized the studio for not providing a large enough marketing budget, pointing out that the previous years Good Night, and Good Luck. had a more successful campaign with television and newspaper ads. The Painted Veil was eventually able to expand to 23 more markets on December 29, 2006 with additional cities on January 5, 2007. Warner Independent also hosted 80 screenings of The Painted Veil in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and London as well as various Hollywood guilds to promote the film. 

==Release==

===Box office===
The Painted Veil initially had a limited release in four theaters in the United States on December 20, 2006, grossing $51,086 over the opening weekend.  The film gradually expanded its showings in the United States and Canada, peaking at 287 theaters on the weekend of January 26, 2007.  The Painted Veil ultimately grossed $8,060,487 in the United States and Canada and $14,525,904 in other territories for a world wide total of $22,586,391. 

===Critical reception===
On the film review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, The Painted Veil has received a 74% fresh rating based on 143 reviews.   On the similar website Metacritic, the film has received a metascore of 69 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, considered generally favorable reviews. 

Manohla Dargis of the New York Times said the story seems "so unlikely for modern adaptation, particularly when, as is the case here, it hasn’t been refitted with a contemporary hook or allegory for audiences who wouldn’t know Maugham from Edna Ferber. Instead, as nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham’s distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance. Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles . . . An inveterate stealer and masticator of scenes, Mr. Norton is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story and he begins riding around heroically on horseback . . . Whether through craft or constitution,   invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character’s emotional thaw and Kitty’s predicament all the more poignant." 

Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times said the film "has all the elements in place to be a great epic, but it fails to connect, to paraphrase Maughams contemporary E.M. Forster, the prose with the passion. Its impeccable, but leaves you cold." 

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three out of four stars and commented, "If youre suspecting this third movie version of W. Somerset Maughams 1925 novel may carry the infectious dullness of prestige filmmaking, rest easy . . . the film is a period piece propelled by emotions accessible to a modern audience . . . The Painted Veil has the power and intimacy of a timeless love story. By all means, let it sweep you away." 

Meghan Keane of the New York Sun said the film "may at times threaten to fall into an abyss of sentimentality, and it has moments that seem mere transitions to propel the plot, but it manages a charming historic portrait without insulting the audiences intelligence." 

Todd McCarthy of Variety (magazine)|Variety thought the story "feels remote and old-school despite a frankness the two previous film versions lacked." He added, "Present scripter Ron Nyswaner makes some solid fundamental decisions, beginning with the telescoping down to the barest minimum the London-set opening . . . All the same, the film is still dominated by the stuffy, repressed personality of Fane, whose emotional stonewalling of his wife produces a stifling of Kittys naturally more vivacious, if common, personality. Despite the extremes of human experience on view, there is a certain blandness to them as they play out, a sensation matched by the eye-catching but picture-postcard-like presentation of the settings . . . Even the ultra-capable Norton and Watts arent fully able to galvanize viewer interest in their narrowly self-absorbed characters." 

==Awards and honors== The Queen (2006). 
 National Board Thank You for Smoking.
 Half Nelson. The Illusionist Down in the Valley.

The London Film Critics Circle nominated Toby Jones Best British Supporting Actor of the Year.
