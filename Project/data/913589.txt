The Subterraneans is a 1958 novella by Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac.  It is a semi-fictional account of his short romance with a black woman named Alene Lee (1931-1991) in San Francisco, 1953.   In the novel she is renamed "Mardou Fox," and described as a carefree spirit who frequents the jazz clubs and bars of the budding Beat scene of San Francisco.  Other well-known personalities and friends from the authors life also appear thinly disguised in the novel.  The character Frank Carmody is based on William Burroughs, and Adam Moorad on Allen Ginsberg.  Even Gore Vidal appears as successful novelist Arial Lavalina.  Kerouacs alter ego is named Leo Percepied, and his long-time friend Neal Cassady is mentioned only in passing as Leroy.

==Criticism and literary significance==
The novel, written as a first-person memoir, has been criticized for its portrayal of American minority groups, especially African Americans, in a superficial light, often portraying them in a humble and primitive manner  without showing insight into their culture or social position at the time. The position of jazz and jazz culture is central to the novel, tying together the themes of Kerouacs writing here as elsewhere, and expressed in the "spontaneous prose" style in which he composed most of his works.  The following quotation from Chapter 1 illustrates the spontaneous prose style of The Subterraneans:

}} French girl (played by Leslie Caron) to better fit both contemporary social and Hollywood palates. While it was derided and vehemently criticized by Allen Ginsberg among others, for its two-dimensional characters, it illustrates the way the film industry attempted to exploit the emerging popularity of this culture as it grew in San Francisco and Greenwich Village, New York.  

A Greenwich Village beatnik bar setting had been used in Richard Quines film Bell, Book and Candle (1958), but Ranald MacDougalls adaptation of Kerouacs novel, scripted by Robert Thom, was less successful.
 MGM films produced by Arthur Freed, and features a score by Andr√© Previn and brief appearances by jazz singer Carmen McRae singing "Coffee Time," and saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, as a street priest, and Art Pepper.  Comedian Arte Johnson plays the Gore Vidal character, here named Arial Lavalerra.
