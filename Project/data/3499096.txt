==Plot== CIA agent Jack Ryan (Ford) is on vacation with his family in London. They witness a terrorist attack on Lord William Holmes (Fox), British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Ryan intervenes and is injured, but he kills one of the assailants, Patrick Miller, while his older brother Sean (Bean) looks on. The remaining attackers flee, as Sean is apprehended by the police. While recovering, Ryan is called to testify in court against Miller, who is part of a splinter cell of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Miller is later convicted for his crimes.
 Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight, Millers escort convoy is ambushed by his comrades, including Kevin ODonnell (Bergin), who execute the police officers, and coordinates an escape. Miller and his companions flee to Northern Africa to plan their next kidnapping attempt on Lord Holmes. Miller also persuades several members of the group to accompany him to the U.S. to murder Ryan and his family.

 
Ryan survives an assassination attempt orchestrated by Annette (Walker) and an accomplice outside the U.S. Naval Academy. Later, Miller and a henchman attack Ryans wife and daughter on a busy highway, injuring them both. Enraged over the attack on his family, Ryan decides to go back to work for the C.I.A., having earlier rejected the appeal of his former superior, Vice Admiral James Greer (Jones).

Ryans work leads him to conclude that Miller has taken refuge in a training camp in History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Libya. A British Special Air Service team attacks and kills everyone in the camp while Ryan looks on through a live satellite feed. Unbeknownst to Ryan, Miller and his companions had already fled the camp and were on their way to the U.S. to stage their next attack.

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations Hostage Rescue Team scrambles to pick up Holmes. Ryan develops a ruse to leave his family and Lord Holmes behind, near a shoreline, while racing away from the coast on a boat. Miller, ODonnell and Annette follow suit, and chase him in a secondary boat. Upon realizing that Ryan is leading them away from Holmes, ODonnell and Annette try to persuade him to turn around.

===Critical response===
{{quote box|quote=
I havent read Clancys Patriot Games, and for all I know this movie is faithful to his book, but on the basis of The Hunt for Red October, which I have read, I expected this one to be a little more cerebral and without the Indiana Jones ending.|source=—Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times   |align=left|width=40%|fontsize=85%|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quoted=2}}
Despite receiving generally positive reviews, the film garnered a lot of controversy during its release, from Tom Clancy disowning the film, to critics complaining it was too different from the book.     The film has earned a 76% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. 

Roger Ebert called it "absorbing" while also commenting how actor Harrison Ford "once again demonstrates what a solid, convincing actor he is".  Chris Hicks of the Deseret News mentioned how director Noyce gave the film "flourish and tension" while star Harrison Ford injected "a commanding sense of decency and humanity to the role of CIA analyst Jack Ryan, making it his own."
