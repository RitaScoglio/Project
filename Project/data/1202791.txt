==Plot==
Terri Fletcher (Hilary Duff) is a teenager with a passion for singing and dreams of becoming a professional singer. Her father Simon (David Keith), a second-generation restaurateur, disapproves of Terris plans, stating that being a singer may not be a worthwhile life choice. In reality, his opposition stems from resentment; Simon turned down a similar scholarship to run his parents restaurant when they became ill; he is intimidated by the thought of his daughter flourishing where he couldnt bring himself to try. Terri is very close to her elder brother Paul (Jason Ritter) who fully supports her dream, despite what their dad says. At Pauls graduation-day barbecue, he has a fight with Simon...who, in the heat of it, grounds his son. Terri sneaks Paul out of the house to attend a Three Days Grace concert. 
 Palm Desert  for the summer and allows her daughter to travel to LA.
 Oliver James) lets her in and Terri arrives safely. While at the program, Terri makes new friends and learns a great deal about music, but problems arise when she is plagued by memories of the car crash which took Pauls life and finds it increasingly difficult to keep her participation in the program a secret from her father. 

Throughout the film, Terri develops a mutual fondness for Jay, but she faces competition from Robin Childers (Lauren C. Mayhew), who was involved with Jay the previous summer. Although Robin still harbors feelings for Jay, it is obvious that he does not reciprocate these feelings. Jay tries to get Robin to cease her efforts to keep him and Terri apart. On one occasion, she kisses him just as Terri walks in. Jay pushes Robin away, but Terri runs off in tears, ignoring Jays insistence that the kiss meant nothing. Later, finding him drunk, Terri and her roommate Denise (Dana Davis) take Jay elsewhere to sober up. When he does, Jay apologizes, and Terri agrees to finish the song theyve been working on for the scholarship contest.

At home, Simon learns of Terris ruse and becomes furious. On the final day, Simon comes to the school and Terri finds him packing up her belongings; he reams his daughter for disobeying and deceiving him, and for turning his own sister and wife against him. She begs him to let her finish what she started here and not let the summer go to waste. Ultimately, her father concedes. Terri and Jay then perform the song they wrote with Terri, dedicating it to Paul. The scholarship prize is won by Denise, yet Simon is proud of his daughter and her talents. He is also glad that her last memory of Paul is one worth having (the concert), as opposed to Simons own (their argument, and Pauls subsequent restriction to his bedroom). Terris teachers hope to see her next year; Simon replies that they just might. Over the end credits, Terri performs for her parents and Nina, with Jay cheering her on.
