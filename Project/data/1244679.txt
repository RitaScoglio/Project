 1942 film Robert Preston, picture to be filmed in color. The movie, released shortly after the United States entry into World War II, was a swashbuckling adventure set in the 1840s along the Florida coast, and was wildly successful.

While he based his film on Strabels story, DeMille took liberties with details such as sibling relationships and sub-plots, while staying true to the spirit of the story, which centers on a headstrong, independent woman portrayed by Paulette Goddard.

==Plot of the Film==
As the film opens, Loxi Claiborne (Paulette Goddard) is running a salvage business started by her deceased father. A hurricane is just passing through the Key West area, leaving behind at least one wreck on the nearby shoals. The Jubilee founders and Loxi and other salvagers race to claim the cargo. Not arriving first, Loxi and her crew rescue the captain, Jack Stuart (John Wayne), but do not share in the salvage rights. It appears that the first salvor on the scene, King Cutler (Raymond Massey), may have actually planned the wreck.
  and Paulette Goddard]]
Nursing Jack back to health, Loxi falls in love with him. When she visits Charleston with her cousin Drusilla (Susan Hayward), Loxi schemes to win a plum captains position for Jack by seducing Steve Tolliver (Ray Milland), who is running the sailing ship line Jack works for. Steve falls for Loxi and returns with her to Key West to investigate the truth about Jacks shipwreck.

Drusilla goes home to Havana when Loxi and Steve return to Key West. Steve has come to rid the Keys of pirates like Cutler (and to be near Loxi). Cutler in turn arranges to have Steve shanghaied by the crew of a whaler. Loxi hears of the plot and gets Jack to help her save Steve. Later, they discover that Steve has concealed Jacks appointment to the steamship Southern Cross on orders from his superior. Angry over a seemingly underhanded act, Jack meets with Cutler. He then learns that Steves boss has just died, and Steve will be taking over the ship line. Jack realizes that he is unlikely to keep his command with Steve in charge. He agrees to work with Cutler to sabotage his new ship and sails to Havana to take command.

Jack is put on trial for wrecking his ship. The testimony reveals a woman may have been on board, though none was rescued. To determine if a woman is in the wreck, Steve agrees to dive to the wreck with Jack. While down in the wreck, Jack and Steve discover proof that Drusilla was on board and has been drowned. They are attacked by a giant squid. Jack saves Steves life but is lost when the Southern Cross slips off the underwater shelf into deep water. Dan Cutler accuses his brother of murder and is shot to death by him, whereupon Steve shoots King Cutler, killing him.

Loxi winds up in Charleston with Steve, apparently now in love with him.
