==Plot==
Twelve-year-old DJ Walters spies on his elderly neighbor Mr. Nebbercracker, who confiscates any item landing in his yard. DJs parents leave town for the weekend, leaving him in the care of Elizabeth "Zee". DJs best friend Charles "Chowder" loses his basketball on Nebbercrackers lawn. DJ is caught by Nebbercracker while recovering it, who rages at him before apparently suffering a heart attack and being taken away by an ambulance. That night, DJ receives phone calls from Nebbercrackers house with no one on the other end. DJ eavesdrops on Zees boyfriend Bones, who tells Zee about losing his kite on Nebbercrackers lawn when he was younger and that Nebbercracker supposedly ate his wife. Later, Bones sees his kite in the doorway of Mr. Nebbercrackers house, but he and the kite are consumed by the house as he is retrieving it.

The next morning, Jenny Bennett is selling Halloween chocolates. DJ and Chowder see her going to Nebbercrackers house, and they rush out to catch her before she is eaten by the house. Jenny calls the police, but police officers Landers and Lester do not believe their story.
 
The trio seek advice from Reginald "Skull" Skulinski, who is claimed to be an expert on the supernatural. They learn that the house is a "Domus Mactabilis" (Latin for "deadly home"); a rare monster created when a human soul merges with a man-made structure. The only way to kill the house is to destroy its heart. They conclude that the heart must be the furnace, as DJ realizes that the chimney has been smoking since Nebbercracker died. Chowder provides a cold medicine-filled dummy that should cause the house to sleep long enough for them to douse the furnace. Landers and Lester thwart their plan and they are arrested when Landers finds the cold medicine stolen from Chowders fathers pharmacy inside the dummy. The cops place the trio in their car while they examine the house. The house eats Landers, Lester and the car. DJ, Chowder and Jenny escape the car but are trapped in the house.

The house falls asleep and they begin exploring. They fall into the basement, finding a collection of toys accumulated from Nebbercrackers lawn, as well as a cage door that opens to a shrine containing the body of Nebbercrackers wife Constance the Giantess, encased in cement. The house realizes they are inside and attacks them. DJ, Chowder and Jenny force the house to vomit them outside by grabbing its uvula. Nebbercracker arrives home alive, revealing that Constances spirit is within the house, and that he did not eat her as the rumor states. Rather, he had given her some of the happiest times in her life. As a young man, Nebbercracker met Constance, who was an unwilling member of a circus freak show and hated children, and fell in love with her despite her obesity. After helping her escape, they began building the house. One Halloween, as children tormented her due to her size, Constance tried chasing them away with an axe, but lost her footing and fell to her death in the basement with the cement burying her body. Nebbercracker finished the house after Constances death, knowing it was what she would have wanted. Aware that Constances spirit made the house come alive, Nebbercracker tried keeping people away by pretending to hate children.

DJ tells Nebbercracker it is time to let Constance go, but the house overhears this. Enraged, the house breaks free from its foundation and chases the group to a construction site. Nebbercracker attempts to distract the house so he can throw a dynamite in, but the house notices and attempts to eat him. Chowder fights the house off with an excavator, causing it to fall into a pit. DJ is given the dynamite, and he and Jenny climb to the top of a crane while Chowder distracts the house. DJ throws the dynamite into the chimney, destroying the house. The trio see Nebbercracker with Constances ghost before she fades away. DJ apologizes to Nebbercracker for the loss of his house and wife, but Nebbercracker thanks DJ and the kids for freeing him and Constance from being trapped for 45 years. That night, children in their Halloween costumes are lined up at the site of Nebbercrackers house, where DJ, Chowder and Jenny help him return the toys to their owners. Jennys parents pick her up and DJ and Chowder go trick-or-treating, which they previously felt they were too old for.

Those who were eaten by the house emerge from the basement. Bones finds Zee is now dating Skull and Landers and Lester leave to confiscation|"inspect" some of the trick-or-treating candy.

==Digital 3-D version== The Polar stereoscopic 3-D film|3-D version of the film was created and had a limited special release in digital 3-D stereo along with the "flat" version.  While The Polar Express was produced for the 3-D IMAX 70mm giant film format, Monster House was released in approximately 200 theaters equipped for new REAL D Cinema digital 3-D stereoscopic projection. The process was not based on film, but was purely digital. Since the original source material was "built" in virtual 3-D, it created a very rich stereoscopic environment. For the films release, the studio nicknamed it Imageworks 3D. 

==Reception==
Monster House grossed $73,661,010 in the United States and Canada, and $66,513,996 overseas for a worldwide collection of $140,175,006.   

The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Based on 158 reviews collected by review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, the film scored a 74% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The sites critical consensus reads, "Monster House welcomes kids and adults alike into a household full of smart, monstrous fun."   

  wrote, "This Monster House is a real fun house. Its a 3-D animated kids film built on classic gothic horror lines, a jokey, spooky Goonies for the new millennium." He also gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  Scott Bowles of USA Today observed, "The movie treats children with respect. Monsters pre-teens are sarcastic, think theyre smarter than their parents and are going crazy over the opposite sex.  Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote, "Its engineered to scare your pants off, split your sides and squeeze your tear ducts into submission."  Michael Medved called it "ingenious" and "slick, clever   funny" while also cautioning parents about letting small children see it due to its scary and intense nature, adding that a "MPAA film rating system|PG-13 rating" would have been more appropriate than its "PG rating."  A. O. Scott of the New York Times commented, "One of the spooky archetypes of childhood imagination the dark, mysterious house across the street is literally brought to life in this marvelously creepy animated feature." 
 Ron and their new cohort, smarty-pants prep school redhead Jenny (Spencer Locke), is Hermione Granger|Hermione....  t is a theme-park ride, with shocks and jolts provided with reliable regularity. Across 90 minutes, however, the experience is desensitizing and dispiriting and far too insistent."
