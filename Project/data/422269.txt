==Plot== Science Advisor to the President David Drumlin pulls the funding from SETI because he believes the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains backing from  secretive billionaire industrialist S. R. Hadden, who has followed her career and allows her to continue her studies at the Very Large Array (VLA) in Socorro County, New Mexico.

Four years later, with Drumlin seeking to close SETI, Arroway finds a signal repeating a sequence of   s welcoming address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first significantly strong television signal to leave Earths atmosphere, which was then transmitted back from Vega, 25 light-years away.

The project is put under tight security and its progress followed worldwide. Arroway learns that the signal contains more than 60,000 "pages" of what appear to be technical drawings. The reclusive Hadden secretly meets with Arroway on his jet to provide the means to decode the pages, found when they are arranged in three dimensions. The pages reveal a complex machine allowing for one human occupant inside a pod to be dropped into three spinning rings.
 Launch Complex religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.

A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in residence on the Space Station, reveals to Arroway that a second machine is hidden in Hokkaido, Japan, and that Arroway will be its pilot. Arroway, outfitted with several recording devices, is locked into the pod of the Japanese machine, dropped into the spinning rings, and disappears. When the pod apparently travels through a series of wormholes, she experiences displacement and can observe the outside environment, including a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on an unknown planet. Arroway finds herself in a surreal beachfront landscape similar to a childhood picture she drew of Pensacola, Florida, and a blurry figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her fathers form and attempts to ask questions. The alien deflects her inquiries, explaining that this journey was just humanitys first step to joining other spacefaring species.
 congressional committee to determine whether the machine was a hoax designed by Hadden, who has died. Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House Chief of Staff Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that although Arroways recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support for the SETI program at the Very Large Array.

==Production==
===Development=== pitched Guber the idea for Contact, who commissioned a development deal.  Sagan, along with wife Ann Druyan, wrote a 100+ page film treatment, finishing in November 1980.   Druyan explained, "Carls and my dream was to write something that would be a fictional representation of what contact would actually be like, that would convey something of the true grandeur of the universe." They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact. 
 Project Phoenix of the SETI Institute; Jodie Foster researched the lead role by meeting her.  Tarter  served as a consultant on the story, realistically portraying struggling careers of women scientists from the 1950s to 1970s. The writers debated whether Arroway should have a baby at the films end.    Although Guber was impressed with Sagan and Druyans treatment, he hired various screenwriters to rewrite the script. New characters were added, one of them  a Native American park ranger-turned-astronaut.  Guber suggested that Arroway have an estranged teenage son, whom he believed would add more depth to the storyline. "Here was a woman consumed with the idea that there was something out there worth listening to," Guber said, "but the one thing she could never make contact with was her own child. To me, thats what the film had to be about."  Sagan and Druyan disagreed with Gubers idea and it was not incorporated into the storyline. In 1982, Guber took Contact to Warner Bros. Pictures and with the film laboring in development hell, Sagan started to turn his original idea into a Contact (novel)|novel, which was published by Simon & Schuster in September 1985. The film adaptation remained in development and Guber eventually vacated his position at Warner Bros. in 1989. 

Guber became the new president of Sony Pictures Entertainment and tried to purchase the film rights of Contact from Warners, but the studio refused. Coincidentally, in 1989, Obst was hired as a new executive at Warner and began to fast track the film, by hiring more writers.  Roland Joffé was eventually hired to direct,  using a screenplay by James V. Hart.  Joffé almost commenced pre-production before he dropped out  and Obst then hired Michael Goldenberg to rewrite the script, who finished his second draft  in late 1993. Goldenbergs second draft rekindled Warner Bros. interest in Contact  and Robert Zemeckis was offered the chance to direct, but he turned down the opportunity  in favor of making a film based on the life of Harry Houdini.  "The first script   I saw was great until the last page and a half," Zemeckis recalled. "And then it had the sky open up and these angelic aliens putting on a light show and I said, Thats just not going to work." 
 George Miller The Jackal myelodysplasia in 1994, Sagan continued to be involved in the production of the film. For the cast and main crew members, he conducted an academic conference that depicted a detailed history of astronomy. 

During the development of Contact, the production crew simultaneously watched   (1968) for inspiration. 

===Filming===
 
Principal photography began on September 24, 1996, and ended on February 28, 1997. The first shooting took place at the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico. "Shooting at the VLA was, of course, spectacular but also one of the most difficult aspects of our filming," producer Steve Starkey said. "It is a working facility, so in order for us to accomplish shots for the movie, we had to negotiate with the National Science Foundation for dish control in order to move the dishes in the direction we needed to effect the most dramatic shot for the story."    After arduous first weeks of location shooting in New Mexico and Arizona, production for Contact returned to Los Angeles for five months worth of location and sound stage shooting that used a total of nine soundstages at Warner Bros.&nbsp;Studios in Burbank, California|Burbank, and Culver Studios. All together, the art department created more than 25 Set construction|sets. 

In an attempt to create a sense of realism for the storyline, principal CNN news outlet commentators were scripted into Contact. More than 25 news reporters from CNN had roles in the film and the CNN programs Larry King Live and Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire were also included. Ann Druyan makes a cameo appearance as herself, debating Rob Lowes character, Richard Rank, on Crossfire. In January 1997, a second unit was sent to Puerto Rico for one week at the Arecibo Observatory.
 White House staff member to consult on Washington D.C. and government protocol issues.    Sagan visited the set a number of times, where he also helped with last-minute rewrites. Filming was briefly delayed with the news of his death on December 20, 1996. Contact was dedicated to Sagan: For Carl comes on the screen at the fade.

===Visual effects===
 , Japan]] RenderMan used blue screen technology because it was a first for the actress. "It was a blue room. Blue walls, blue roof. It was just blue, blue, blue," Foster explained. "And I was rotated on a Lazy Susan with the camera moving on a computerized arm. It was really tough." 
 The Jackal. Mars rock speech," the director explained, "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say, I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open." 
 continuity errors during the location shooting at the Very Large Array in New Mexico. "The weather killed us, so we were going back in and changing it enough so that the skies and colors and times of day all seem roughly the same," visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston commented. 
 Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004). 

The decoding of the extraterrestrial message, with its architectural drawings of the machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effects shots, using a combination of model and miniature shots and digital computer work. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that "The Machine in Sagans novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if youre going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable." He continued that "it had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real."  The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a conceptual design he had originally created to appear as the "Time Displacement Device" in   in a scene that did not make the final cut. 
 Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle.  There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machines surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks. 

The climactic scene depicting the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near the core of the galaxy. Ralston said that "the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream."  To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroways mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied. 

The Hitler newsreel also required digital manipulation.

===Science and religion=== experience by Palmer Joss, which he describes as seeing God, is met by Arroways suggestion that "some part of   needed to have it"—that it was a significant personal experience but indicative of nothing greater. Joss compares his certainty that God exists to Arroways certainty that she loved her deceased father, despite her being unable to prove it. 

Contact depicts intense debate occurring as a result of the apparent contact with aliens. Many clips of well-known debate shows such as Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire and Larry King Live are shown, with participants discussing the implications of the message, asking whether it is proof of the existence of alien life or of God, and whether science is encroaching upon religious ground by, as one believer puts it, "talking to your god for you."  The head of a religious organization casts doubt on the morality of building the machine, noting: "We dont even know whether   believe in God." The first machine is ultimately destroyed by a religious extremist, in the belief that building it was detrimental to humankind. 

Although the revelation at the end of the film that Arroways recording device recorded approximately 18 hours of static is arguably conclusive proof of the fact of—if not the experience of—her "journey", several coincidences and indications throughout the film cast doubt on its authenticity. Director Robert Zemeckis indicated: "The point of the movie is for there always to be a certain amount of doubt  ."  These indications consist mostly of visual cues during the "journey" that echo Ellies experiences earlier in the film (which Ellie believed to be the result of the aliens "downloading   thoughts and memories"), but the timing of the messages arrival and its eventual decoding are also highly coincidental: the message was first received shortly before Arroway and her team were to be ejected from the VLA facility and was successfully decoded only by S.R. Hadden (Arroways only sponsor, who was close to death from cancer) after weeks of failed attempts by the team at the VLA. 

At the end of the film, Arroway is put into a position that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary. 

Zemeckis stated that he intended the message of the film to be that science and religion can coexist rather than being opposing camps, Robert Zemeckis, Steve Starkey, DVD audio commentary, 1997, Warner Home Video  as shown by the coupling of scientist Arroway with the religious Joss, as well as his acceptance that the "journey" indeed took place. This, and scattered references throughout the film, posit that science and religion are not nominally incompatible: one interviewer, after asking Arroway whether the construction of the machine—despite not knowing what will happen when it is activated—is too dangerous, suggests that it is being built on the "faith" that the alien designers, as Arroway puts it, "know what theyre doing."

==Controversies==
===Bill Clinton=== found in a NASA scientist was published in the journal, Science (journal)|Science, proposing that the meteorite might contain evidence for microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria (later, a disputed interpretation).   The announcement made headlines around the world and the following day, on August 7, 1996, the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, made remarks about the news at a press conference that were, in places, sufficiently generic in nature to allow fragments of his videotaped statement to be included in Contact, implying that Clinton was speaking about contact with extraterrestrial life, congruent with the films story: 

 

Later in the film, a separate fragment of generic remarks by President Clinton, speaking about Saddam Hussein and Iraq at a different press conference in October 1994, was lifted out of context and inserted into Contact:

 

On July 14, 1997, three days after the film opened in the United States, Warner Bros. received a letter from White House Counsel Charles Ruff protesting against the use of Clintons digitally-composited appearance. The letter made no demands to director Robert Zemeckis or Warner Bros. about pulling release prints, film trailers, or other marketing, but called the duration and manner of Clintons appearance "inappropriate". No legal action was planned; the White House Counsel simply wanted to send a message to Hollywood to avoid unauthorized uses of the Presidents image. Zemeckis was reminded that official White House policy "prohibits the use of the President in any way ... (that) implies a direct ... connection between the President and a commercial product or service." 
 First Amendment, Mike McCurry believed that "there is a difference when the Presidents image, which is his alone to control, is used in a way that would lead the viewer to believe he has said something he really didnt say." 

===CNN=== Tom Johnson Bernard Shaw) to appear in the film, even though both CNN and Warner Bros. are owned by Time Warner. Johnson added that, for Contact, the CNN presence "creates the impression that were manipulated by Time Warner, and it blurs the line." CNN then changed their policies for future films, which now requires potential appearances to be cleared through their ethics group.   

===Lawsuits=== George Miller, who had developed Contact with Warner Bros. before Zemeckis hiring, unsuccessfully sued the studio over breach of contract policies. 

During filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the previous week.   Coppola claimed that Sagans novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special  back in 1975,  titled First Contact. Under their development agreement,  Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan would write, with American Zoetrope and Sesame Workshop|Childrens Television Workshop Productions. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon & Schuster published Contact and Warner moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.   

In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres dismissed Coppolas claim. Although Torres agreed that Sagan violated some terms of the contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit,    taking it to the California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.   

===NASA=== cyanide pill" caused some controversy during production and when the film came out. Gerald D. Griffin, the films NASA advisor, insisted that NASA has never given any astronaut a cyanide pill "just in case," and that if an astronaut truly wished to commit suicide in space, all he or she would have to do is cut off their oxygen supply.  However, Carl Sagan insisted that NASA did indeed give out cyanide pills and they did it for every mission an astronaut has ever flown. Zemeckis said that because of the two radically different assertions, the truth is unknown, but he left the suicide pill scene in the movie as it seemed more suspenseful that way and it was also in line with Sagans beliefs and vision of the film.
