}} Gerald Clarkes biography Capote and was directed by Bennett Miller. It was filmed mostly in Manitoba  in the autumn of 2004. It was released September 30, 2005, to coincide with Truman Capotes birthday.

==Plot==
At a farm in Kansas, a family friend discovers the dead bodies of four members of the Clutter family.  While reading The New York Times, the story of the Clutters rivets writer Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who calls The New Yorker magazine editor William Shawn (Bob Balaban) to tell him that he plans to document the tragedy.
 Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) to come along.  Capote intends to interview those involved with the victims, the Clutter family, with Lee as his go-between and facilitator.  Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigations lead detective on the case, brushes him off, but Deweys wife Marie (Amy Ryan) is a fan of Capotes writing and persuades Dewey to invite Capote and Lee to their house for dinner. 
 Perry Smith Richard "Dick" Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), are caught.  Flattery, bribery and a keen insight into the human condition facilitate Capotes visits to the prison where the accused are being held.

Capote begins to form an attachment to Smith.  He informs Shawn of his intent to expand the story into a full-length book.  Following the trial and conviction, Capote is able to gain continued access to the murderers by bribing Warden Marshall Krutch (Marshall Bell).

Capote spends the following years regularly visiting Smith and learning about his life, excepting a year-long stint when Capote goes off to Morocco and Spain to write the "first three parts" of the book, accompanied by his romantic partner Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood).

The story of Smiths life, his remorseful manner, and emotional sincerity impress Capote, who becomes emotionally attached to him despite the gruesome murders. Capote aids Smith and Hickock by obtaining expert legal counsel for them and initiating an appeal.  Still Capote is frustrated, as Smith declines to relate to him exactly what happened on the night of the murders.  

Though initially an effort to provide proper representation and extend his opportunity to speak with the killers, the appeals process ends up dragging on for several years. Without the court case being resolved Capote feels he is stuck with a story without an ending, and he is unable to complete his book. Eventually Capote does get Smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail. Capote has what he was after from Smith, but in the process sees a callousness and selfishness in his own actions.

Now with everything in hand, he still must wait for the appeals process to conclude before he feels he can publish his work. He desperately wants the whole thing to finally be over. In the course of time Lees best-selling novel To Kill a Mockingbird is turned into a movie, but Capote is unable to share in the joy of his friends success, too caught up in drinking through his own misery.

With the last appeal rejected, Smith pleads for Capote to return before he is executed, but Capote cannot bring himself to do so. A telegram from Smith to Harper Lee ultimately compels Capote to return to Kansas. There Capote is an eyewitness as Smith and Hickock are executed, with Smiths hanging and Capotes shocked reaction being explicitly shown.  

Capote talks to Lee about the horrifying experience and laments that he could not have done anything to stop it. She poignantly replies, "Maybe not. The fact is you didnt want to."  The final scenes show Capote looking through photos from the case and at the writings and drawings given to him by Smith. An epilogue points out that In Cold Blood turned Capote into the most famous writer in America, also noting that he never finished another book.
