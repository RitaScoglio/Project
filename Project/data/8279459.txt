==Release==
===Theatrical===
Haunted Harbors official release date is 26 August 1944, although this is actually the date the seventh chapter was made available to film exchanges. 

The serial was re-released on 26 September 1951, under the new title Pirates Harbor, between the first runs of Government Agents vs. Phantom Legion and Radar Men from the Moon.  It began a pattern of re-releasing an old serial between every new release, which lasted until Republics last new serial was released in 1955.  Three years of purely re-releases then followed. 

==Critical reception==
Cline writes that this "jungle-horror-mystery-sea-story" includes all of the "cliffhanging tricks Republic could muster."
