Revolution OS is a 2001 documentary film that traces the twenty-year history of GNU, Linux, open source, and the free software movement.
 hackers and entrepreneurs including Richard Stallman, Michael Tiemann, Linus Torvalds, Larry Augustin, Eric S. Raymond, Bruce Perens, Frank Hecker and Brian Behlendorf.

== Synopsis ==
 

The film begins with glimpses of Raymond, a Linux Initial public offering|IPO, Torvalds, the idea of Open Source, Perens, Stallman, then sets the historical stage in the early days of hackers and computer hobbyists when code was shared freely. It discusses how change came in 1978 as Bill Gates, in his Open Letter to Hobbyists, pointedly prodded hobbyists to pay up. Stallman relates his struggles with proprietary software vendors at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, leading to his departure to focus on the development of free software, and the GNU project.

Torvalds describes the development of the Linux kernel, the GNU/Linux naming controversy, Linuxs further evolution, and its commercialization.

Raymond and Stallman clarify the philosophy of free software versus communism and capitalism, as well as the development stages of Linux.

Michael Tiemann discusses meeting Stallman in 1987, getting an early version of Stallmans GNU Compiler Collection|GCC, and founding Cygnus Solutions.
 PC to Sun workstation. He relates his early dealings with venture capitalists, the eventual capitalization and commodification of Linux for his own company, VA Linux, and its Initial Public Offering|IPO.
 patches for the NCSA web server daemon with other developers, which led to the release of "a patchy" webserver, dubbed Apache.
 executives releasing the source code for Netscapes browser, one of the signal events which made open source a force to be reckoned with by business executives, the mainstream media, and the public at large.  This point was validated further after the films release as the Netscape source code eventually became the Firefox web browser, reclaiming a large percentage of market share from Microsofts Internet Explorer.

The film also documents the scope of the first full-scale LinuxWorld Summit conference, with appearances by Linus Torvalds and Larry Augustin on the keynote stage.

Much of the footage for the film was shot in Silicon Valley.

== Screenings ==

The film appeared in several film festivals including South by Southwest, the Atlanta Film and Video Festival, Boston Film Festival, and Denver International Film Festival; it won Best Documentary at both the Savannah Film and Video Festival and the Kudzu Film Festival.

== Quotes ==
 I bumped into him (Craig Mundie of Microsoft) in an elevator. I looked at his badge and said, "Ah, you work for Microsoft." 
He looked back at me and said, “Oh yeah, and what do you do?”  Eric S. Raymond}}

 

 

 

== Reception ==

Every review noted the historical significance of the information, and those that noticed found the production values high, but the presentation of history mainly too dry, even resembling a lecture.  Ron Wells of Film Threat  found the film important, worthwhile, and well thought out for explaining the principles of the free software and open source concepts.  Noting its failure to represent on camera any debate with representatives of the proprietary software camp, Wells gave the film 4 of 5 stars.   TV Guide rated the film 3 of 4 stars: "surprisingly exciting", "fascinating" and "sharp looking" with a good soundtrack. 
Daily Variety saw the film as "targeted equally at the techno-illiterate and the savvy-hacker crowd;" educating and patting one group on the head, and canonizing the other, but strong enough for an "enjoyable" recommendation.   

On the negative side, the New York Times faulted the films one-sidedness, found its reliance on jargon "fairly dense going", and gave no recommendation.   
Internet Reviews found it "a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy. Raging against Microsoft and Sun.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.", lacking follow-through on Red Hat and VALinux stock (in 2007, at 2% of peak value), with "lots of talking heads".    Toxicuniverse.com noted "Revolution OS blatantly serves as infomercial and propaganda. Bearded throwback to the sixties, hacker Richard Stallman serves as the movements spiritual leader while Scandinavian Linus Torvalds acts as its mild mannered chief engineer (as developer of the Linux kernel)." 
 Sun and DEC software and hardware, and its growth solely due to the Apache web server. And Lord notes that the film shows, but does not challenge Torvalds or Stallman about their equally disingenuous remarks about the GNU/Linux naming controversy|"Linux" vs "GNU/Linux" naming issue.
