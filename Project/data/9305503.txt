== Reception ==
Variety (magazine)|Variety dismissed the film as "yet another depiction of the collective anomie felt by a group of thirtysomething friends clinging to their high-school glory days. Tyro writer-director Mitchell Altieris thin, but occasionally engaging pic plods along a path well-trodden by indie filmmakers of the 90s, particularly Whit Stillman and Noah Baumbach, while never amassing the rich characterizations or pointed insights that have distinguished this genres more memorable efforts."   Don R. Lewis of Film Threat rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, "Lurking in Suburbia isnâ€™t a perfect film, but its a damn good one."   Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk rated it 4/5 stars and described it as "a sly, personal, and low-key indie comedy that manages to become more accessible and likable the longer it goes on."     David Johnson of DVD Verdict called it "an authentic, lighthearted, well-acted look at one guys struggles with growing up."
