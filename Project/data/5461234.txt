==Production==
The film was originally conceived as a Hebrew stage musical by composers Coby and Iris Recht,  but after meeting with movie mogul Menahem Golan, the Rechts agreed to prep the story for an English-language musical film.     Golan wrote the script, Coby composed the music, Iris wrote the lyrics  and songwriter George S. Clinton was hired as an assistant to polish the lyrics, since the Rechts English was minimal.   

Cattle-call auditions for the film were held in London in 1979.  Catherine Mary Stewart was on her way to dance class when she encountered a few classmates heading in the opposite direction to audition for the film, so she tagged along.  "The director, Menahem Golan, was sitting by watching the proceedings and I noticed that he was doing that ‘frame thing’ with his hands and fingers and looking through towards ME," Stewart said.   Stewart planned to perform her own songs, but having no professional singing experience, the producers decided to switch her voice.  "Even though the coach I was working with thought I would be able to do the work, the producers got cold feet and hired Mary  , a professional singer, before we recorded anything." 

Filming took place from September to December 1979 in West Berlin, West Germany. 

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack album was released by Cannon Records in 1980.  Versions of several songs on the album ("Coming", "Showbizness", "Master" and "Child of Love") differ substantially from those used in the film, and Joss Acklands song "Creation" (a variation of "Universal Melody") didnt make the final cut of the movie.  The album has never officially been issued on Compact Disc|CD. Yma Sumac is often wrongly accredited with the film,  as she did not appear, nor was her music used.

 
# "BIM" – Grace Kennedy & Allan Love
# "Universal Melody" – Mary Hylan & George Gilmour
# "Coming" – Grace Kennedy
# "I Found Me" – Grace Kennedy
# "The Apple" – Allan Love
# "Cry for Me" – Mary Hylan & George Gilmour
# "Speed" – Mary Hylan
# "Creation" – Joss Ackland
# "Where Has Love Gone?" – George Gilmour
# "Showbizness" – Vladek Sheybal & Ray Shell
# "How to Be a Master" – Vladek Sheybal, Grace Kennedy, Allan Love & Ray Shell
# "Child of Love" – Joss Ackland, Mary Hylan & George Gilmour

==Critical reception== Georgio Moroders   insane brother...The Apple should be a celebration of all that is camp. Instead, its just seriously disturbed." 

==Alternate version==
In 2008 there was a mixup booking the print for a screening at Los Angeles|L.A.s The Silent Movie Theatre, so MGM sent over uninspected reels marked "Screening Print."     Presumably this was an original preview print, as it included additional scenes that were cut out of the widely released version (including the complete Coming and Child of Love musical sequences which had been truncated in the final print), a simpler entrance for Mr. Topps at the end (instead of exiting from a Rolls Royce, he merely transforms from the previously seen hippie leader), and the closing credits were presented in a different font and layout.   This version was screened a few times at The Silent Movie Theatre,  and it subsequently ran at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in August 2008. 

==DVD==
The Apple was released on a Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Video on August 24, 2004.
