Two rival sisters, Alice and Elsa, have been apart for two years. Alice, a promising young artist, lives in an attic flat in Paris. Her lover Franck, a boxer, has just moved in with her. Problems for the happy couple ensue when Elsa, a bored housewife, suddenly appears unannounced at their door after leaving her cheating husband Thomas and their two children, and a menage-a-trois develops. Elsa immediately begins trying to dominate their lives. Alice wants the out-of-control Elsa, who disrupts their life by playing psychological games with them, to leave, but then suddenly changes her mind, unable to bring herself to throw Elsa out. To thank her, Elsa destroys her art studio, has sex with Franck, convinces him that Alice is unbalanced, and then ties Alice up in her apartment.

The music by Michael Nyman has been praised as one of his better works, and considered unusually buried in the sound mix of the film.  The album is Nymans 23rd release, and the fourteenth with the Michael Nyman Band.  The American album became very difficult to come by; American Nyman fans attempting to special order the album only a few years later were often presented with copies of Randy Edelmans Six Days Seven Nights, derived from distributors fuzzy searches.  In France, however, the album was promoted as "Michael Nyman Nouvel Album."
 Michael Nyman, String Quartet No. 3 with material from other themes written for the score of the film.

The only liner notes on the French release of the album are an uncredited synopsis of the film in French.
