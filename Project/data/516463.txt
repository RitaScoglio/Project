==Plot==
  Frodo begins his story with Samwise Gamgee, his friend and companion, treading through Mordor as Ring-bearer in Frodos absence, when Frodo is captive in the orc fortress of Cirith Ungol. During his journey, Sam ponders claiming the Ring himself; but rejects the idea and rescues Frodo. 
 Gandalf the Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor II|Denethor, the Steward of the Throne, about the upcoming war—only to discover that the Steward has become insane and means to take his own life. Frodo and Samwise continue toward Mount Doom (eluding Ringwraiths and infiltrating a "battalion of orcs" in the process) only to be attacked by Gollum. As Sam holds Gollum off, Frodo reaches the Crack of Doom; but is subverted by the Ring. At the same time, Gondors neighboring country, Rohan, helps it claim victory in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, where King Théoden and the Witch-King of Angmar are slain. Upon his own arrival, Aragorn plans to confront Sauron at the gates of Mordor. Here, he quarrels with the Mouth of Sauron and the two armies prepare for battle. 
 Eagles from the erupting Mount Doom. A few months later, Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor. The story concludes with Frodo agreeing to accompany Bilbo, Gandalf, and Elrond as they leave Middle-earth. He gives the Red Book (consisting of Bilbos memoirs with some spare pages) to Sam, assuring him that a good life is still in store for him. Gandalf assures them that hobbits shall someday have descendants among humans, to preserve their own existence; and the film terminates in Frodos departure from the Grey Havens.

==Reception==
The film has garnered mixed reviews from modern sources. Charles Cassidy, of Common Sense media gave it a score of 3/5, and said, "Cartoon tale is darker, more complex than others in series".  Steven D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide gave it a C, and said, "Works even less well than The Hobbit, which really is a childrens story… overbearing folk-ballad soundtrack doesnt even gesture lyrically to Tolkiens poetry".  It currently holds a score of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes. 

==Marketing==
In the absence of an official sequel to Ralph Bakshis The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King has come to be marketed by Warner Bros. as the final part of a loose animated Tolkien trilogy preceded by The Hobbit. The middle film is very different in tone and character design, however, and the final two films do not join up seamlessly, as both omit various segments from The Two Towers, most notably regarding the events in Shelobs lair. Other omissions in the Rankin/Bass version include the characters of Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli, Legolas, Arwen, and Saruman. Aragorn is present but he has very little dialogue or screentime.

==Home Media==
The Return of the King was first released on VHS by Warner Home Video in 1991, and for the second time as part of the "Warner Bros. Classic Tales" video collection in 1996. The film was available on DVD since 2001, both individually and as a "boxed trilogy" with the Rankin/Basss The Hobbit and Bakshis The Lord of the Rings.  It is now out of print. It was re-released on a Remastered Deluxe edition DVD on July 22, 2014.
