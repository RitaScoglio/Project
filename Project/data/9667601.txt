== Plot ==
Kasi is a tale about the deception of appearances. Kasi(Vikram) is a blind poet and singer who supports his family by his songs. He has an older brother Sevalai(Thalaivasal Vijay) who spends what money he has drinking, an abusive, crippled father and a younger sister Lakshmi(Kavya Madhavan).  When the local landlord, Raghupathi(Rajeev) returns to the district, he brings along with him Mr Dinesh, the CMs son and his wife Radhika(Aishwarya). Raghupathi has a reputation as a God in the area because of his charitable works and when a specialist eye doctor arrives he promises to pay the fees for an operation to give back Kasis vision. Elated by this news, Kasi learns that he has to find an eye-donor and his girlfriend Kaveri(Kaveri), who cannot speak, offers one of her eyes. Unfortunately, something happens that shows that the God-like Raghupathi and Mr Dinesh are not what they seem.  Blissfully unaware of the sadness of those around him, Kasi looks forward to his operation.

== Production == Simran was Vikram s sister and she refused the offer because she dont wanted act in sister roles. Then Malayalam actress Kavya Madhavan happily accepted the character by impressing its original Malayalam version. The shooting was completed in just 45 days. Vikram had rolled up his eyes to look convincingly blind in the film for this deglamorised role of an innocent, rural, struggling blind lead character.  For the movie, he sunbathed on the terrace of his beachside home in Chennai for a sunburnt look and got dizzying headaches while practising to look blind.

Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu said, "The magic touch, in the music of the maestro (Ilaiyaraja) is missing in Kasi". 

== Critical response ==
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. The Hindu applauded the off-beat attempt stating, "A film without predictable ingredients is a rarity. The Kasi team has to be appreciated for its boldness, in telling a story, in a simple, straight forward manner without the evitable distractions". While Vikrams portrayal was appreciated, "As a blind man, with his eyeballs completely in and with facial twitches so typical of the visually impaired, his portrait is realistic", the two lead actress too received acclaim, "Kavya Madhavan and Kaveri, have excellently expressive eyes, which have been put to good use".    S. R. Ashok Kumar said, "As the blind Kasi, he touched a chord".  Sify noted, "Vikram, it goes without saying that he is the life and soul of Kasi. As the blind singer, he brings laughter, tears and a lump in oneâ€™s throat. Vikram has given an extraordinarily detailed performance, which only a Kamalhassan can do!" and summed up saying its an emotionally powerful movie.  Balaji Balasubramaniam wrote, "The movie is populated with characters that have a big effect, both positive and negative, on us".  

Kasi was commercially successful as well.
