Gray Lady Down is a 1978 disaster film by Universal Studios starring Charlton Heston, David Carradine, Stacy Keach, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, and is the feature film debut of Christopher Reeve. It is based on David Lavallees book Event 1000.

==Plot== commander Paul Blanchard (Heston) is on his final submarine tour before promotion to command of a submarine squadron (SUBRON|COMSUBRON). Surfaced and returning to port, the submarine USS Neptune, is struck by a freighter in heavy fog, and sinks to a depth of 1,450 feet (442 meters) on a canyon ledge above the ocean floor. A United States Navy rescue force, commanded by Captain Bennett (Keach), arrives on the scene, but Neptune is subsequently rolled by a landslide to a greater angle that does not allow the Navys Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) rescue submarine to complete its work.

A small experimental submersible, Snark, is brought in to assist with the rescue. Snark is very capable, but run by a nonconformist U.S. Navy officer misfit, Captain Gates (Carradine). The tiny submersible is the only hope for a rescue.

==Production==
Ronny Cox plays Neptune s executive officer, scheduled to take over command from Charlton Heston s character; Ned Beatty plays Snark s second crewman; and Christopher Reeve appears in his first film role.
 USS Cayuga (LST-1186) is also featured in the film as the rescue ship USS Cayuga.
