==Plot==
A shy, gentle man named Clifford Skridlow (Dan Aykroyd) is a professor of comparative literature at the financially strapped (fictional) Monroe College in Chicago. A chance encounter with four beautiful high class prostitutes at a restaurant changes his life forever. Smooth Walker (Howard Hesseman), their pimp, is in danger due to his enormous debt to the gruff "Mom" (Kate Murtagh), a Chicago mob boss. Smooth invents a fictitious business partner, the flamboyant "Doctor Detroit," in an attempt to save himself from Moms wrath.

Through a series of comical misunderstandings, Cliff is conned into becoming Smooth Walkers patsy. He transforms himself into Doctor Detroit, embarking on a dangerous mission to protect the girls from Mom. He also must keep this secret from his straight-laced parents while simultaneously attempting to secure a large endowment for the struggling university. Cliff becomes a hero to the four women, but puts his life at grave risk.

The film was shot on location in Chicago during the summer of 1982.

==Reaction and sequel==
In her autobiography, Enter Whining, Fran Drescher comments that this film was expected to be a major hit for the summer of 1983, but that it fell short of that expectation; by the time the film ended its run in theaters, it had only managed to make US$10.8 million, on a budget of US$8 million.

The end titles promise the release of Doctor Detroit II: The Wrath of Mom, meant as a gag based on  , released eleven months previously.  Aykroyd was said to have been writing the script; however, the project went unfulfilled due to poor box office results.
