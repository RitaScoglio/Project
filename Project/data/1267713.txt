==Plot== British Crown James Bentley), migraine attacks. The arrival of three servants at the house &mdash; an aging nanny and servant named Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), an elderly gardener named Mr. Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a mute girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) &mdash; coincides with a number of odd events, and Grace begins to fear they are not alone.

Anne draws pictures of four people: a man, a woman, a boy called Victor, and an old woman, all of whom she says she has seen in the house. A piano is heard from inside a locked, empty room. Grace finds and examines a 19th-century "book of the dead," an album of mourning portrait photos of recently deceased family members. Doors which Grace believes to have been closed and locked are found mysteriously ajar. She tries hunting down the "intruders" with a shotgun but cannot find them. She scolds her daughter for believing in ghosts &mdash; until she hears them herself. Eventually, convincing herself that something unholy is in the house, she runs out in the fog to get the local priest to bless the house. Meanwhile, the servants, led by Mrs. Mills, are clearly up to something of their own. The gardener buries a headstone under autumn leaves, and Mrs. Mills listens faithfully to Annes allegations against her mother.
 front and disappears again. After Charles leaves, Anne continues to see things, including Victors whole family and the old woman.

Grace breaks down to Mrs. Mills, who claims that "sometimes the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living." One morning, Grace wakes to the childrens screams: All of the curtains in the house have disappeared, as Anne had said they might. When Grace finds out the servants arent alarmed by the mysterious disappearance of the curtains, Grace realizes that they are somehow involved. Hiding the children from the light, she banishes the servants from the house. A series of loud noises from the houses upper floor follows this event. That night, Anne and Nicholas sneak out of the house to find their father, and stumble across the hidden graves, which they realize belong to the servants. At the same time, Grace goes to the servants quarters and finds a photograph from the book of the dead and is horrified to see it is of the three servants. The servants appear and follow the children, who make it back to the house just as Grace emerges to hold off the servants with a shotgun.

The servants reveal that they died of   before taking her own life. In a frenzy of denial, Grace shakes the séance table, and rips up the sheets of paper on the table and throws them into the air. However, the visitors see only the table shaking and the paper being ripped and scattered. 

As Grace and the children huddle together in shock, her memories return to her: Stricken with grief for her missing husband and increasingly frustrated by their isolation, Grace went insane and smothered her children with a pillow. Then, realizing what she had done, she put a rifle to her forehead and pulled the trigger. When she then "awoke" and heard her childrens laughter, she assumed God had granted her family a miracle, a second chance at life. 

Mrs. Mills appears and tells Grace that they will learn to get along with the "intruders" who periodically come to the house. "Sometimes well notice them," she says, "and sometimes we wont. Thats how its always been." The children find they are no longer sensitive to light (as they are no longer living), and for the first time they can enjoy the sunlight coming through the windows. The living occupants, unable to rid the house of its former occupants spirits, drive away as Grace and the children watch from an upstairs window. The last scene shows a man closing the great gate to the property, to which he has attached a FOR SALE sign.

Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, praising that "...Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric". However, he noted that "in drawing out his effects, Amenábar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance." 

William Skidelsky of The Observer has suggested that it was inspired by the 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw.
