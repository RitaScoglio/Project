==Plot==
Nicole Oakley, the spoiled, rich, out-of-control daughter of congressman Tom Oakley, meets a working class Mexican-American straight-A student, Carlos Nuñez, resulting in a clash of cultures, values, and a love affair. Nicole is troubled because her mother committed suicide when she was very young. She feels unwanted by her father, who is now married to another woman and has another young daughter with his new wife. Carlos, on the other hand, is from a poor background and working hard towards becoming a Navy pilot. They meet at a beach while Nicole is on "community service" and discover they attend the same high school.

They later fall in love, and Carlos spends so much time with her that he stops performing well in school. Carlos is applying to the U.S. Naval Academy and Nicoles father suggests Carlos talk to him about gaining his Congressional sponsorship to the Academy. During their meeting, Nicoles father tells Carlos that he needs to break up with Nicole if he does not want her to destroy his life. Carlos does break up with her, which leads Nicole into depression and back into wild, drunken partying. One night, Carlos really misses her and when he calls her, he finds out she is getting drunk at a high school party. He crashes it and saves a drunken Nicole from a boy trying to take advantage of her. Carlos drives her home, but they get stopped by the police.

As a result of this incident, Nicoles father and stepmother decide that she needs to go to a boarding school far away from home; Carlos rescues her and they run away together. While they are away, Nicole realizes she is really messing up Carloss life by taking him away from his dreams and goals, so she decides to sober up. They go back home and she makes up with her father. Her father thanks Carlos for not listening to his advice to stay away from Nicole. In the end credits, we see that Carlos has become a pilot with the Navy.
