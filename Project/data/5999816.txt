}} novel of the same name. It was directed by Phillip Noyce and starred Michael Caine, Brendan Fraser, and Do Thi Hai Yen.
 1958 version, depicted Greenes original ending and treatment of the principal American character, Pyle. Like the novel, the film illustrates Pyles moral culpability in arranging terrorist actions aimed at the French colonial government and the Viet Minh. Going beyond Greenes original work, the film used a montage ending with superimposed images of American soldiers from the intervening decades of the Vietnam War. 
 Oscar as Best Actor.

==Plot== triangle that develops between Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in his fifties; a young American idealist, supposedly an aid worker, named Alden Pyle; and Phuong, a Vietnamese woman. On another level it is also about the growing American involvement that led to the full-scale American war in Vietnam. 

Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), who narrates the story, is involved in the war only as a reporter, an unengaged observer, apart from one crucial event. Pyle (Brendan Fraser), who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, is a CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) operative sent to steer the war according to America’s interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of York Harding, an American foreign policy theorist who said that what Vietnam needed was a "third force" to take the place of both the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels and restore order. This supposedly anti-colonialist and anti-communist force was plainly meant to be America, and so Pyle sets about creating a "Third Force" against the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader General Thé (based on the actual Trinh Minh The). His arming of Thés militia with American weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon. These bombings, dishonestly blamed on the Communists in order to further American outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children. 

Meanwhile, Pyle has stolen Fowlers Vietnamese mistress Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen), promising her marriage and security.  When Fowler finds out about Pyles involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates.  He indirectly agrees to let his assistant, Hinh (Tzi Ma), and his Communist cohorts confront Pyle; when Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him.  Phuong subsequently returns to Fowler, and while the local French police commander (Rade Šerbedžija) suspects Fowlers role in Pyles murder, he has no evidence and does not pursue the matter.
