I clowns (also known as The Clowns) is a 1970 television film by Federico Fellini about the human fascination with clowns and circuses. It was made for TV, the Italian station RAI with an agreement that it would be released simultaneously on TV and as a cinema feature;  RAI and co-producer Leone Film compromised on its release, with RAI broadcasting it on Christmas Day, 1970, and Leone Film releasing it theatrically in Italy the following day, December 26, 1970.   It is a part-documentary, part fantasy.
