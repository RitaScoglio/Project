 western suburbs. Footy Legends was released in Australia on 3 August 2006.

==Plot==
Set in Sydneys western suburbs, Footy Legends tells the story of Luc Vu (Anh Do), a young Vietnamese Australian man with an obsession about rugby league football. Out of work and with welfare authorities threatening to take away his little sister (Lisa Saggers), because their parents are dead and Luc is deemed incapable of being a responsible guardian, Luc re-unites his old Yagoona High School "footy" team&mdash;whose members are now facing social problems such as long-term unemployment, drug addictions, the after-effects of teenage parenting&mdash;and wins a competition that offers a Holden Ute and a modelling job for Lowes Menswear as its prize. It is mostly comedy which is underpinned with serious social issues affecting western Sydney.

The film features Vietnamese-language dialogue between Vu, Anne, and their aged grandfather.
