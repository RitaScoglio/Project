==Plot==
The title character, Raja Hindustani (Aamir Khan), is a taxi-driver / tourist guide. He lives by his own simple code and is prone to violence when that code is violated. Aarti Sehgal (Karisma Kapoor) is a wealthy debutante who is seeking to connect with her past. Standing in the way of their love are a disapproving father and a stepmother bent on obtaining total control of the family assets.

Wealthy Mr Sehgal (Suresh Oberoi) lives with his daughter, Aarti, and her stepmother Shalini (Archana Puran Singh) in a palatial home. Aarti decides to go for a vacation to a small hill station named Palankhet to discover the memories of her dead mother. Upon arrival, she finds out she has no transportation from the airport to Palankhet (few location in Ranikhet also). As a result, she hires the services of the only available driver, Raja Hindustani. During her stay in Palankhet, Aarti and Raja fall in love. One day, to Aartis surprise, her father arrives in Palankhet and intends to take her home with him. Her father will accept the marriage on the condition that Raja come to Mumbai and learn to become a respectable member of society. Raja refuses and forces Aarti to make a decision. Aarti chooses Raja, but begs for her fathers blessings. Her father refuses to offer his blessings and leaves for Mumbai.

After some time, Mr Sehgal forgives his daughter, and visits her in Palankhet. While there, he gifts his daughter and son-in-law a new house. Raja refuses to live in the house because he does not see the house as a gift, but rather as alms, since he is poor and Mr. Sehgal is rich. Shalini, her brother, Swaraj (Pramod Moutho), and her nephew Jai (Mohnish Behl) seek to exploit this conflict to gain total control of Mr. Sehgals assets. Under the pretext of a birthday party, they bring Raja and Aarti to Mumbai and set in motion events that will change all their lives forever. As a result Aarti and Raja separate. Aarti was pregnant but due to her health problems the doctor forbids her to go to Palankhet and instead her stepmother is asked to go to Palankhet to inform Raja about his baby and to request him to come to Mumbai. However, instead Aartis stepmother chooses to tell Raja that Aarti wants to divorce him but Raja refuses, and back in Mumbai even Aarti refuses to give Raja divorce. After sometime Raja comes to know that Aarti has a baby so he goes to Aartis house and steals the baby. But Aarti cannot live without her baby so she comes to Rajas house begging for her baby where they all learn the truth that Aartis stepmother is the culprit. When Raja returns home with the baby he sees Aarti and starts to run away but in the road there is a fight between Aartis step-uncle and Raja for the capture of the baby as Aarti s step-uncle wants to kill the baby but Aarti s step-uncle loses at last; Aarti and Raja reunite.
