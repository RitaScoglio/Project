==Production==

===Early development===
In March 2001, Jurassic Park III director Joe Johnston denied rumors of a fourth film.  
Late in Jurassic Park III s production, executive producer Steven Spielberg devised a story idea for a fourth film. He wished the idea had been used for the third film instead.    In June 2001, Johnston said he would not direct the film, and that Spielberg had a story idea that would take the series mythology to a new level. {{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/13/jurassic-park-iv-probably-but-without-joe-johnston |title= Jurassic Park IV? Probably, But Without Joe Johnston |publisher= IGN.com
|date= June 13, 2001 |accessdate= 2014-11-01|first= Steve|last= Head}}  Johnston later said the film would feel like a departure from previous films, implying it would not be set on an island.  In July 2001, actor Sam Neill, who portrayed List of characters in Jurassic Park#Dr. Alan Grant|Dr. Alan Grant in previous films, said he could not imagine a way for his character to be involved in another film.  That same month, Johnston denied, then later hinted, that the film would involve the Pteranodons from the ending of Jurassic Park III.  

In April 2002, it was reported that the film would be the last one in the series, and would ignore its predecessors events.  In a June 2002 interview with Starlog magazine, Steven Spielberg officially confirmed the fourth film, which he hoped to have Joe Johnston direct. Spielberg confirmed there was a story which he considered to be the best one since the first film.  On November 4, 2002, Sam Neill said there was a chance he would be in the film.  On November 7, 2002, William Monahan was announced as screenwriter, with Spielberg  Kathleen Kennedy as producer.  A month later, the film was announced for a summer 2005 release. 

In January 2003, Jeff Goldblum said he had been asked to stay available for a possible return of his character Ian Malcolm.  On January 30, 2003, it was reported that the story would involve dinosaurs migrating to the Costa Rican mainland. A team of experts, including Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm, chart an expedition to one of InGens offshore islands and discover the dinosaurs breeding uncontrollablly.   In April 2003, Stan Winston confirmed his special-effects studio was in the design phase for the film. Winston also said that Spielberg wanted to adapt several previously unfilmed scenes from Michael Crichtons Jurassic Park novels.  In July 2003, Keira Knightley said she was in consideration for two separate roles, including a small role as a granddaughter.

First there was the granddaughter part, which wasnt all that big a role; she was only in it at the beginning. The other part he was considering for me was substantially larger, but I wont go into any details in case I make Steven angry (laughs). ... I truly dont know if Ill end up getting either part or not. The script is pretty much locked down, but I think theyre still working on final drafts at the moment.}}  Monahans first draft of the script was finished later that month, with a story no longer set in the jungle as in previous films. A director had yet to be discussed at that time.  Sam Neill confirmed he would reprise his character, with filming set to begin in 2004 in California and Hawaii. 
 John Hammond. Jack Horner Kingdom of Frank Marshall had joined the project as a producer. 

In June 2004, it was reported that Alex Proyas was in discussions to direct, with filming expected to begin in March 2005 for a re-scheduled winter 2005 release. Filming would have started at Pinewood Studios, where a massive tank was to be constructed for scenes involving marine reptiles.   In July 2004, the script was being rewritten, with Jeremy Piven and Emmy Rossum being considered for two of the lead roles and Richard Attenborough reprising his character. 
Later that month, Proyas said he was not interested in directing the film. 

In August 2004, Aint It Cool News published a review of a leaked draft of the films script. The story would have involved a new character, a mercenary named Nick Harris, who is hired by a Swiss corporation and put in charge of training a team of five genetically-modified Deinonychus for use in rescue missions. John Hammond would be the only returning character in this draft.   In 2005, John Sayles confirmed this to be an early draft of the script, intercepted through Steven Spielbergs email by a hacker. 
 Fantastic Four.  Sayles was still re-writing the script in September 2004, with the film on track for a winter 2005 release.  Sayles next draft, which involved genetically engineered human-dinosaur mercenaries, was scrapped. 

In April 2005, Stan Winston confirmed the film was on hold due to repeated revisions of the films script, none of which satisfied Spielberg. According to Winston, "He felt neither of   balanced the science and adventure elements effectively. Its a tough compromise to reach, as too much science will make the movie too talky, but too much adventure will make it seem hollow."  In November 2005, Spielberg said he planned to include a scene in the film (taken from the novel, The Lost World) that would involve characters on motorcycles outrunning raptors. 

In January 2006, Joe Johnston and Jack Horner were working on a new screenplay,  with more work on it expected to begin immediately after the 2008 release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  In February 2006, Frank Marshall said the film now had a good script, with filming expected to begin in 2007 for a 2008 release.  In March 2006, Marshall said the film had a script and was getting a director, with Johnston as a possible candidate.  In April 2006,
Marshall said there was an idea for the film, but not a script. Marshall went on to deny that Michael Crichton 
would write the script, or that Steven Spielberg would direct it.  The script was still being worked on in June 2006. 

In July 2006, Spielberg denied an Internet rumor that Breck Eisner would direct, saying Johnston was standing by for the job.  In December 2006, Laura Dern said she was open to the possibility of reprising her role as Ellie Sattler, but had not been contacted about appearing in the film.  In March 2007, Sam Neill said he knew nothing about the project. 

In April 2007, Dern said she had been contacted about appearing in the film, with filming expected to begin within the year for release in 2008.  It was also reported that Joe Johnston would not be directing the film.  In December 2007, Frank Marshall said further work on the script could not commence until the end of the 2007 08 Writers Guild of America strike, with filming potentially starting in 2008 for a release in the summer of 2009.  Jack Horners 2009 book, How to Build a Dinosaur, was originally meant to come out at the same time as the film as a scientific companion volume. 

Richard Attenborough, before his death, was contacted about reprising the role of John Hammond.  Jeff Goldblum had expressed some interest in reprising his role of Ian Malcolm for the fourth film. 
 Frank Marshall Kathleen Kennedy were asked if there was any development on the sequel. Kennedy responded, "No... I dont know. You know, when Michael Crichton passed away, I sorta felt maybe thats it. Maybe thats a sign that we dont mess with it."  While Marshall and Kennedy were no longer signed with Universal Pictures in a production capacity, it was said that the two would remain involved with the studio and its plans for Jurassic Park 4.  In November 2009, Joe Johnston discussed the possibility of Jurassic Park 4, stating that the story for the film is completely different from that of its predecessors and would take the franchise into a whole other trilogy.  In a January 2010 interview, Johnston reiterated that Jurassic Park 4 was set to be the beginning of a second Jurassic Park trilogy.  He described the story as "essentially the beginning of the second Jurassic Park trilogy."  

By June 16, 2011, Spielberg had met twice with writer Mark Protosevich to work on a story for a potential fourth Jurassic Park film.  

===Pre-production===
At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Spielberg said a writer was working on a treatment for the film, which he said would be possibly released "within the next two or three years."     A representative from Universal said 2013 would be the preferred deadline for completion.    Over the next three months, Mark Protosevich wrote two story treatments for the film.  Spielberg had hoped to have a writer working on a full screenplay for Jurassic Park IV by the time he started filming his other project, Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln, in October 2011, with the hope that the script would be finished by the time Lincoln was finished. However, he and Kathleen Kennedy felt neither of Protosevichs treatments consisted of the right story for a fourth film. 

Despite this, Spielberg said in October 2011 that the script was being written by Protosevich, and that he felt the story they were working on was stronger than that of Jurassic Park III.  In January 2012, Spielberg announced that he would not be directing the film, opting instead to be a producer.  On June 21, it was confirmed that Rise of the Planet of the Apes writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver would be scripting Jurassic Park 4. 
 Frank Marshall said, "No decisions have been made regarding where we are shooting."  Shortly thereafter, the director of studio operations at Raleigh Studios in Baton Rouge, Louisiana confirmed that Universal Pictures had reserved space there from April to November 2013, without specifying the project for which it was reserved.    On March 14, 2013, Universal announced that Colin Trevorrow, director of Safety Not Guaranteed, would be directing the film,       while Patrick Crowley was announced as a producer.    

Director  .   Two story ideas were kept from earlier drafts: a homicidal dinosaur that has to be stopped, and a human who has a relationship with Velociraptors. However, Trevorrow felt those ideas in their original form were too extreme and had to be "pulled way, way, way back." A previous draft also included multiple hybrid dinosaurs, which was ultimately reduced to one. 

In April 2013, Jack Horner said in an interview that a new, previously extinct creature would rise to stardom in the film, saying, "I cant actually tell you who that will be... But youll want to keep the lights on after you see this movie."  A Twitter post attributed to Trevorrow stated there would be no feathered dinosaurs in the film. 

Trevorrow and Connolly wrote their draft of the script over a couple of weeks.  The studio received the draft on May 6, 2013, and found the script changes more large-scale than anticipated.  On May 8, 2013, the studio announced it was pushing the release from June 13, 2014, to an unspecified future date.   Prior to the delay, actors Bryce Dallas Howard, David Oyelowo and Garrett Hedlund had been considered for roles in the film.  Filming had been set to begin June 24, 2013.    Delaying the film allowed Trevorrow and Connolly more time to work on the script.  Another reason for the delay was to allow time for the construction of practical sets for the fictional theme park; it was previously intended to add in these buildings using computer effects. 

On May 2, 2013, Trevorrow tweeted a picture of Kauai taken during location scouting with the caption "Nublar", the name of the island in the original film.    That November, he tweeted that "Reboot is a strong word. This is a new sci-fi terror adventure set 22 years after the horrific events of Jurassic Park."  According to Trevorrow in August 2013, production was on hold, and the films release date had been pushed to 2015. 
 Nick Robinson was cast as Simpkins older brother,  while Josh Brolin was in talks to play the adult lead.   By the middle of the month, Brolin was no longer in talks for the film, and Chris Pratt was in early negotiations for the lead role,    a "rugged, ex-military man named Owen."    Ron Howard tweeted in January 2014 that Pratt had been cast in a lead role. 
 digital IMAX screen. 

By February 7, Legendary Pictures had agreed to co-finance the film.  By February 28, Vincent DOnofrio had joined the cast to play the films antagonist. Irrfan Khan was also cast as head of the Masrani Corporation, now in ownership of Isla Nublar and the park.     That same month, Trevorrow confirmed that BD Wong would reprise his role as Dr. Henry Wu, and said the character would have a more significant role than in the original film.    On March 21, 2014, French actor Omar Sy announced he had joined the cast.  On March 26, 2014, actor Jake Johnson confirmed his role in Jurassic World as a tech-savvy operations overseer named Lowery.       By April 3, Judy Greer, Katie McGrath, and Lauren Lapkus had joined the cast.  Andy Buckley was cast on May 7.   By June 27, James DuMont had also joined the cast.

On August 5, 2014, director Colin Trevorrow announced on Twitter that filming had wrapped.

Hasbro will release action figures based on the film. 

==Controversies==

===Scientific accuracy===
While the first Jurassic Park film is described as an attempt to create up-to-date dinosaurs based on current knowledge, changing the public view of dinosaurs as slow and giant lizard-like reptiles, Jurassic World is being criticized for purposely ignoring new discoveries and knowledge, such as some dinosaurs being covered with feathers or proto-feathers and the way Velociraptors held their front limbs.  Since the teaser trailers initial release, many paleontologists expressed their disappointment on Twitter, Facebook and their own blogs, calling the dinosaurs that were featured a retrograde step from the original Jurassic Park. 

=== Writing credits dispute === WGA arbitration panel ruled that Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver would receive a "screenplay by" credit with Trevorrow and Connolly, who strongly disagreed with the decision.   Trevorrow and Connolly decided that under WGA rules, they did not have grounds to appeal the decision; they accepted the ruling on March 31, 2015.  On April 2, 2015, it was reported that Universal Pictures originally wanted the names of one writing team to appear in the screen credits, that being Trevorrow and Connolly, with the late Michael Crichton getting a "based on the novel by" credit. In the films Super Bowl trailer, the credits showed that the film had been "written by" Trevorrow and Connolly. It was reported that Trevorrow and Connolly appealed the WGAs decision; that they wrote an entirely new screenplay that was not based on Jaffa and Silvers draft; and that they wanted their solo "written by" credit restored.   

On April 7, 2015, it was reported that the arbiters had unanimously denied Trevorrow and Connollys appeal in a second hearing held on April 3, and that they gave Jaffa and Silver an additional "story by" credit. It was reported that Trevorrow and Connolly appealed the WGAs latest decision.  Later that day, 
Trevorrow clarified the situation and denied that he and Connolly appealed the WGAs original decision (giving Jaffa and Silver credit for the screenplay), despite disagreeing with it. Trevorrow also stated that he and Connolly were not informed of the second hearing until it was already over. Although Trevorrow and Connolly strongly disagreed with the decision to give Jaffa and Silver a "story by" credit, they decided not to appeal it.    The credits of the screenplay finally went to both writing teams, with a "story by" credit to Jaffa and Silver, and a "based on characters created by" credit to Crichton. 

== Possible sequels ==
On the possibility of potential sequels, Trevorrow said: "We wanted to create something that would be a little bit less arbitrary and episodic, and something that could potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story."
