 epic historical Tamil & Telugu languages.
 Mughal Emperor Jodhabai who becomes his wife, played by Aishwarya Rai. The music is composed by acclaimed composer A. R. Rahman. The soundtrack of the movie was released on 19 January 2008.  The film has won the Audience Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the São Paulo International Film Festival,  two awards at the Golden Minbar International Film Festival,    seven Star Screen Awards and five Filmfare Awards, in addition to two nominations at the 3rd Asian Film Awards.   

==Plot== Mughal emperor, Akbar, and a Rajput princess, Jodhaa.

Political success knew no bounds for Emperor Akbar (Hrithik Roshan). After having secured the Hindu Kush, his empire extends from Afghanistan to the Bay of Bengal, to the Narmada River. Through a shrewd blend of diplomacy, intimidation and brute force, Akbar won the allegiance of the Rajputs. This allegiance was not universal.  But little did Akbar know that when he married Jodhaa (Aishwarya Rai), a fiery Rajput princess, in order to further strengthen his relations with the Rajputs, he would in turn be embarking upon a new journey – the journey of true love.

The daughter of King Bharmal of Amer, Jodhaa resented being reduced to a mere political pawn in this marriage of alliance, and Akbars biggest challenge now lies in winning the love of Jodhaa – a love hidden deep below resentment and extreme prejudice. 

==Historical accuracy==
Many of the events portrayed in the movie are based on real events. Certain Rajput groups claimed Jodhaa was married to Akbars son, Jahangir, not Akbar.  The film was not released in 30 cinema theatres in Rajasthan. 

Several historians claim that Akbars Rajput wife was never known as "Jodha Bai" during the Mughal period.
According to Professor Shirin Moosvi, a historian of Aligarh Muslim University, neither the Akbarnama (a biography of Akbar commissioned by Akbar himself), nor any historical text from the period refer to her as Jodha Bai. {{cite news

}}  Moosvi notes that the name "Jodha Bai" was first used to refer to Akbars wife in the 18th and 19th centuries in historical writings.  In Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, she is referred as Mariam Zamani. 

According to historian Imtiaz Ahmad, the director of the Khuda Baksh Oriental Public Library in Patna, the name "Jodha" was used for Akbars wife for the first time by Lieutenant-Colonel James Tod, in his book Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan. According to Ahmad, Tod was not a professional historian. {{cite web

Ashutosh Gowarikars reaction was,  

===Protests and legal issues=== historical revisionism that minimised Rajput history.   The communitys protests against the film in some states, and it has been banned by the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand. However, the producer moved to the Supreme Court by challenging it.   Later, the Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on screening the film for now in Uttar Pradesh and some towns of Uttarakhand and Haryana. The court scrapped the Uttar Pradesh government ban as well as similar orders by authorities in Dehradun in Uttarkhand and in Ambala, Sonepat and Rewari in Haryana.

Anil Sinanan of   gave the film four out of five stars, noting that, "although the 16th-century love story upon which its based might be long forgotten, this endearing treatment sears into the memory through sheer size and scale alone   Dont let the running time put you off watching this unashamedly epic tale."  Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film three stars, stating that, "Jodhaa Akbar works only because its heart is in the right place. The film talks about a love that transcends all barriers – gender, religion, culture – and dreams of an India where secularism and tolerance are the twin towers that should never ever crumble. And Akbar and Jodhaa are the alluring exponents of this dream." Kazmi also suggests that "if you are willing to shed off all the trappings of history, only then will Jodhaa Akbar work for you."  While suggesting that the film is "too long" and that it is "not a history lesson," Rachel Saltz of The New York Times also notes, "in choosing to tell the tale of this emperor and a Muslim-Hindu love story, Mr. Gowariker makes a clear point. As Akbar says, Respect for each others religion will enrich Hindustan. "
