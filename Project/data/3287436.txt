==Plot==
  neglected and landlady who parallel version of the Pink Palace inhabited by copies of her parents, called the "Other Mother" and "Other Father", who strongly resemble her parents, but have black buttons for eyes. These beings prove to be warmer and more attentive than Coralines real parents (particularly the Other Mother, who does everything she can to impress Coraline). Coraline falls asleep in the Other World, but when she awakens the next morning, she finds herself back in her old world.

Despite warnings from her neighbors, Coraline continues to venture to the Other World at night to escape the doldrums of her real life, and is entertained by button-eyed "Other" versions of her neighbors, including a quiet Other Wybie, a fun Mr. Bobinsky who runs a circus and young Miss Spink and Miss Forcible who are great actresses. Back in the real world, while shopping for school clothes, Coraline asks her mom for mittens, only to be rejected. Angry with her mom, Coraline returns to the Other World. During her third visit, Coraline encounters a black cat from her own world (who has the ability to speak in the Other World), who warns Coraline of danger. He warns her that this place is not a "dream come true" and that the "Other Mother" is not a "mother" at all. She disregards his warnings until the Other Mother invites her to live in the Other World forever if she can sew buttons over her eyes. Horrified, Coraline pretends to be tired and hurries off to bed, only to find herself still in the other world when she awakens. Coraline attempts to leave by walking away from the house, only to be where she started. Coraline breaks into a room and finds the door to be blocked by the Other Mother. Coraline demands to return home and tells the Other Mother that she is not her mother. Enraged, the Other Mother transforms into a tall, slender, and monstrous form, trapping Coraline in a small room behind a mirror. There, she meets the ghosts of three children who lost their eyes and lives to the Other Mother. They plead with Coraline to avoid their fate and request that she find their eyes, which will free them from their imprisonment. With the help of the Other Wybie, Coraline escapes to her own world, but finds that her parents have been kidnapped by the Other Mother.
 seeing stone arachnoid creature with hands made of sewing needles) will never let her go, even if she wins. Thinking quickly, Coraline tricks the Other Mother into opening the door to the real world and escapes through it, closing the door on the Other Mothers hand, severing it. Coraline finds her parents safe with no recollection of what happened and the ghost children at peace, but not long after, they warn her the Other Mother will still try to retrieve the key. To keep the Other Mother from returning, Coraline intends to drop the key to the door between her world and the Other World down a water well near her house; the Other Mothers severed hand, however, enters Coralines world and tries to steal the key. Wybie arrives to help her, and the two destroy the hand. They then drop the remains (and the key) down the well. With her parents done with their work and able to spend time with their daughter, Coraline holds a garden party with her family and neighbors, including Wybies grandmother. Coraline plans to tell Miss Lovat (Wybies grandma) her adventure and what really happened to her twin sister, who is now known to be one of the ghost children. Coraline content with her new life and the black cat looking to the audience, walking by a pole and disappearing.

==Cast==
* Dakota Fanning as Coraline Jones, a brave, clever, curious 11-year-old   girl with dark blue hair. She is annoyed by not being taken seriously by (in her opinion) crazy adults, people constantly mistaking her name for Caroline, and her mundane and bland life. Gaiman describes her as "full of vim and spunk and all those wonderful old-fashioned words." 
* Teri Hatcher as Mel Jones, Coralines busy mother, and the Other Mother. In the film,  Mel has a brace around her neck from a truck crash Coraline mentioned; the Other Mother has a turtleneck jumper instead.  Mel is a writer working on a gardening catalog. She loves her daughter, but is very busy and doesnt always give her the attention that Coraline thinks she needs. The Other Mother is the creator of the other world and its inhabitants, she can also transform herself into different people, as shown after Coraline re-visits the other world after mistaking The Other Mother as her real one. Teri Hatcher describes Other Mother as the seemingly "perfect mom, because shes a perfect cook and has the perfect answer to every question, and later on she becomes quite monstrous."  Her true form is a spider-like witch with a bony face and hands fashioned from sewing needles. The three ghost children refer to her as "the beldam", an archaic word meaning "good lady" but used to refer to a "hag" or a "Witchcraft|witch". stuffed remains taffy and the dogs turn into dog-bats. Saunders and French both collaborated in the animated series of Pongwiffy.
* John Hodgman as Charlie Jones, Coralines father, and the Other Father. Hodgman described him as "the kind of guy who walks around a banana peel and falls into a manhole."  Author Neil Gaiman describes him as a man who "does that thing that parents do when they embarrass their kids and somehow think theyre being Cool (aesthetic)|cool."  The Other Father is a singer-pianist, as well as a gardener. He acts like the Other Mothers slave, showing a scared and traumatized attitude. However, he still seems to retain some aspects of Coralines real father, repeatedly stating that the Other Mother is forcing him to do this and that, and that he truly does not want to hurt Coraline.
** John Linnell as Other Fathers singing voice giant who Chernobyl Liquidator, ringmaster of a circus of rats disguised as jumping Mouse|mice, and later exists only as a coat filled with rats. appears and disappears at will and has the ability to speak in the Other World. He forms a bond with Coraline and acts as her guide and mentor throughout her journey.
* Robert Bailey, Jr. as Wyborn "Wybie" Lovat, the geeky, nervous 11-year-old grandson of Coralines landlady. Wybie is a character introduced for the film adaptation so that the viewer "wouldnt have a girl walking around, occasionally talking to herself."  Though Coraline finds him creepy and regularly insults him, the two end up becoming friends. The Other Wybie has been rendered incapable of speech by the Other Mother, as she thought Coraline would prefer him that way.
* Carolyn Crawford as Mrs. Lovat, Wybies presumably overprotective grandmother and the owner of the Pink Palace Apartments. She originally grew up in the old Victorian mansion with her twin sister, who mysteriously vanished, kidnapped by the Other Mother. Believing that someone "stole" her sister, Mrs. Lovat moved out of her childhood home and divided it into three apartments, which she rents. Afraid of the Beldam claiming another child, she does not allow Wybie to enter it, nor allow any tenants with children to rent the apartments.

==Production==

Director Henry Selick met author Neil Gaiman just as he was finishing the novel Coraline, and given that Gaiman was a fan of Selicks The Nightmare Before Christmas, he invited him to a possible adaptation of the film. As Selick thought a direct adaptation would lead to "maybe a 47-minute movie", his screenplay had some expansions, such as the creation of Wybie. When looking for a design away from the style seen in most animation, Selick discovered the work of Japanese illustrator Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become the concept artist. One of Uesugis biggest influences was on the color palette, which was muted in reality and more colorful in the Other World. "The Making of Coraline", Coraline DVD  Uesugi declared that "at the beginning, it was supposed to be a small project over a few weeks to simply create characters; however, I ended up working on the project for over a year, eventually designing sets and backgrounds, on top of drawing the basic images for the story to be built upon." 
 Victorian mansions, a 42-foot (12.8 m) apple orchard, and a model of Ashland, Oregon including tiny details such as banners for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.  More than 28 animators would be working at any one time on rehearsing or shooting scenes, producing 90–100 seconds of finished animation each week.  To add the stereoscopy for the 3D release, the animators would shoot each frame from two slightly apart camera positions. 
 3D models, ranging from facial expressions to doorknobs were printed in 3D using the Polyjet matrix systems, which enable the fast transformation of CAD (computer-aided design) drawings into high-quality 3D models.    The puppets had separate parts for the upper and lower parts of the head, that could be exchanged for different facial expressions.   The characters of Coraline could potentially exhibit over 208,000 facial expressions.  composite separatedly shot elements together, or add some elements of their own which had to look handcrafted instead of computer-generated&nbsp;– for instance, the flames were done with traditional animation and painted digitally, and the fog was dry ice. 

At its peak, the film involved the efforts of 450 people,  including from 30    to 35  animators and digital designers in the Digital Design Group (DDG) directed by Dan Casey and more than 250 technicians and designers.  One crew member, Althea Crome,  was hired specifically to knit miniature sweaters and other clothing for the puppet characters, sometimes using knitting needles as thin as human hair.  The clothes would also simulate wear using paint and a file (tool)|file.   Several students from The Art Institute of Portland were also involved in making the film.
 nonsense language.    Selick mentions that the main soloist, "a young girl you hear singing in several parts of the film" is coincidentally named Coraline.  Coraline won Coulais the 2009 Annie Award for best score for an animated feature.

A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film "exquisitely realized" with a "slower pace and a more contemplative tone than the novel. It is certainly exciting, but rather than race through ever noisier set pieces toward a hectic climax in the manner of so much animation aimed at kids, Coraline lingers in an atmosphere that is creepy, wonderfully strange and full of feeling."
