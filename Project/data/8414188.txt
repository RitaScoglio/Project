==Plot summary== veldt during colonial era. cruel and unusual methods. One man is covered in clay and roasted alive on a spit; another is tarred, feathered, and trussed, then chased and killed by all the women. The man who insulted the tribesmen is trapped in a ring of fire with a poisonous snake.

Wildes character is spared until the last. He is stripped naked and given a brief head start, then chased by some of the tribesmen.  With a combination of luck, cunning, and desperation, he eludes the warriors, killing several; finds food and water; and, after many days, returns to a colonial fort just seconds ahead of his pursuers.

===Cast notes=== fencer in 1936 and remained in excellent condition.  However, he was over 52 years old when the movie was shot and was sick during much of the filming, but pressed on, saying the illness added to his performance. 

Five of the ten actors playing tribal hunters were cast together in the 1964 South African film Diamond Walkers. 

In the original theatrical release there is a very long shot with Wilde in the mid foreground and way in the distance, a mile or so behind him, one can see a tiny land rover crossing the screen on the horizon.

===Critical reception===
The minimal dialog, richly realized African settings, and emphasis on making "the chase (and violent combat along the way) a subject unto itself, rather than the climax to a conventional story"  distinguish Naked Prey as an innovative and influential adventure film.  However, although it is considered a small classic today,  it received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Robert Alden of  , but the truth is theyd nail you before you got across the river and into the trees." 

Other reviewers, however, were more enthusiastic. In Time, the film was described as "a classic, single-minded epic of survival with no time out for fainthearted blondes or false heroics" where "natives are not the usual faceless blacks but human beings whose capacity for violence the hero quickly matches."   The Variety reviewer praised the documentary-style use of nature photography to show "the pattern of repose, pursuit, sudden death and then repose" that characterises the entire chase. 

===Later releases===
The Naked Prey was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in January 2008.

===Soundtrack=== Nguni tribal songs specifically recorded for the film. 

==Cinematic influence== Joel and Ethan Coen shot their own version of The Naked Prey on a Super 8 film camera. They called it Zeimers in Zambia and cast a neighbor, Mark Zimering, in the lead role. 

Mel Gibsons film Apocalypto resembles The Naked Prey in its plot and in several similar scenes. The scenario of a man being pursued by a pack of warriors who set out, one by one, after he has reached the point where a loosed arrow fell was seen also in the 1957 film Run of the Arrow. 
 Jeremiah Johnson has a similar plot line wherein native American tribesmen give chase often, individually, to challenge Redfords character (Jeremiah Johnson) to duel to the death.  Similarly, he signs off with the chief from a distance at the end of the movie.

==Cultural influence==
The progressive rock group, Coheed and Cambria, was originally named Shabütie after the African chant from the film. Shabütie translates to "Naked Prey".

==In popular culture== Far Away Abe coaxes Peggy to go see the film with him. His pitch: "Youre resisting a chance to see Cornell Wilde naked? I heard he wrestles a boa constrictor. Sounds pretty dirty."
