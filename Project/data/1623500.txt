 1989 action World Wrestling Shane Distribution Company" copyright and was released by New Line Cinema on June 2, 1989. It was launched as an attempt to boost Hulk Hogans acting career several years after his appearance in Rocky III.

==Plot== World Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Champion, and his appearances on network television have been a thorn on the side of Brell, the head of the struggling World Television Network. The day after Rips most recent title match, Brell attempts to bribe the champion into joining his network, but Rip declines the offer. After Rip disposes of Brells thugs on his way home, Brell visits the No Count Bar, where he comes up with his own wrestling program called Battle of the Tough Guys. The show is successful due to the introduction of Zeus, an ex-convict and former protege of Rips trainer Charlie. Zeus wins the $100,000 tournament and becomes Brells prized fighter.

Samantha, a beautiful corporate spy, is sent by Brell to seduce Rip. However, Rips good nature and dedication to charity wins her over, and she confesses her identity to the wrestler and turns to his side. After this fails, Brell attempts to have Samantha raped; Rip foils the plot and dispatches the would-be rapist into a tree trunk. Meanwhile, Brell and Zeus crash an outdoor charity event Rip is appearing at, demanding that Rip prove his honor by fighting Zeus live on Brells new show. Once again, Rip avoids violent conflict, not wanting to set a bad example for the children present and attempts to reason with Brell, who leaves in anger. Rips younger brother Randy and a friend decide to check out Zeus for themselves, attending an illegal fight being held in a warehouse. After watching Zeus defeat the monstrous Lugwrench Perkins, Randy foolishly identifies himself as Rips brother to Brell and his associates. Randy attempts to defend himself, but Zeus brutally beats him, sending him to the hospital. Enraged, Rip accepts Zeus challenge to avenge his brother.

On the night of the match, Brell has Samantha kidnapped and orders Rip to lose the fight to save her life. As the battle begins, Samantha manages to escape, but just as Brells goons corner her, Charlie rescues her by knocking them out with a fire extinguisher. Zeus has the upper hand at the start of the fight, ruthlessly pummeling Rip, even trying to kill him by ripping out one of the steel posts and trying to run Rip through. Randy cheers to urge his brother to fight back. Rip is re-energized by Randys words and once he sees Samantha is safe, gains a second wind and starts to turn the tides on Zeus. The fight destroys the ring, with Rip and Zeus continuing the battle up the through the stands as a disbelieving Brell watches from the control room. Rip finally puts an end to the match by knocking Zeus off a catwalk, which causes him to fall through the ring and lose. A frustrated Brell begins destroying electrical equipment, in total disbelief over Zeus loss. Rip angrily goes after Brell intending to repay him for his misdeeds. In fear, Brell retreats, but accidentally touches live wires he exposed in his tirade and is electrocuted to death. With his enemies now vanquished, Rip celebrates his victory with Randy and his friends.

==Box office and reception==
The movie debuted at #2, behind Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with United States dollar|$4,957,052 in ticket sales.    Hogan writes in his autobiography the budget was about eight million dollars.  Vince McMahon, who financed the movie, more or less broke even because of distribution fees. The final tally was $16,093,651 in ticket sales. 
 Monday Night Raw, Vince McMahon joked, "Hogan promised me that if the movie lost money he was gonna return his salary. I guess the check is still in the mail." This was during the Monday Night Wars and was part of a number of digs at Hogans then-new movie project Assault on Devils Island. Raw commentator Jim Ross also joked during the late 90s; "No Holds Barred? More like No Profit Allowed."

The film was widely panned by critics, with a 11% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews .  Film critic Brian Orndorf described the film as "tremendously crude, unapologetically manipulative, and aimed directly at easily entertained 13-year-old boys." 

==Home video==
The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1990. It was released on DVD for the first time ever with a digitally remastered transfer by WWE Home Video under the WWE Studios banner on July 3, 2012.   

It was released two years later in April 2014 on Blu-ray disc.

===Match result=== Big Boss Demolition by countout, and Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect defeated Ron Garvin.

 . Unlike traditional tag-team steel cage match rules the WWF had in place at the time, wherein both members of one team had to exit the cage to win, the match could end with a pinfall.

After a back and forth match early on, all four competitors were knocked out after Hogan hit a suplex on Zeus, and Beefcake and Savage hit each others heads into the cage structure. Sensational Sherri (the manager of the Savage-Zeus team) handed a chain to Savage, who attempted to strike Beefcake with a fist drop off the top of the cage, but Beefcake recovered and caught Savage coming off. Eventually, Beefcake knocked Savage to the mat and escaped the cage; Savage—with some eventual help from Beefcake—crawled outside, tying the match at 1-apiece.

Meanwhile, Hogan rallied against Zeus, battering him before dropping three leg drops to score the pin and the win for the Hogan-Beefcake team.

====Aftermath====
This was Zeus last match in the WWF, as Lister left shortly afterward; meanwhile, Savage continued to target Hogan over the WWF Championship.

Among the dark matches, the Demolition-Colossal Connection match was contested one day prior to the match were the Colossal Connection won the WWF Tag Team Championship, while Dino Bravo continued to be the Ultimate Warriors top foe for the Intercontinental Championship.
