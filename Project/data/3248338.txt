The Masked Marvel is really stuntman Tom Steele throughout the serial except the very final shot, in which he removes his mask. The mask was directly moulded from Steeles face. Despite this, Tom Steele was given no screen credit at all, even for the bit parts and stunts he performed in addition to the title role.   The voice of the Masked marvel was dubbed in by radio actor Gayne Whitman, since Steeles natural voice was a light tenor, somewhat similar to Henry Fondas, and did not record as particularly "tough."  However, in Steeles most visible secondary role, as a murderous assassin, he disguises his voice, apparently believing that his natural voice would be used for the Marvel.

===Cliffhangers===
Chapter four has an unusual cliffhanger, especially for Republic, as it has no action or death involved.  Instead, Sakima, sitting behind his desk in his secret basement, simply (although incorrectly) announces "So, Jim Arnold is the Masked Marvel." 

===Stunts=== stunt gaffer on this serial.  As stated above, he received no screen credit for this.   Steele himself was doubled by a dummy in the scene in which the Marvel is thrown off the top of an enormous gas tank.  On the way down one of the dummys arms gets caught in the rigging of the tank and is clearly ripped off. Yet when the Marvel lands in the back of the truck below, he has both arms intact.  The budget and schedules of serials mandated retakes only in the most dire circumstances.

As an odd outcome of playing both the Masked Marvel and other stunts and bit parts, in one scene Tom Steele chased himself up some stairs. 

One stunt in Chapter 10 is particularly notable:  to prevent a rolling handcar filled with explosives from destroying a train transporting aircraft parts, the Masked Marvel crashes his own car into the handcar.  The Masked Marvel survives by jumping aside at the last second. Harmon and Glut write that "the scene is both thrilling and perfect craftsmanship."

===Special effects===

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The Masked Marvels official release date is 6 November 1943, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges. 

===Television===
The Masked Marvel was one of twenty-six Republic serials re-edited into features for television release in 1966.  The title was changed to Sakima and the Masked Marvel.  This version was 100-minutes in length. 

==Critical reception==
Harmon and Glut describe The Masked Marvel as an "exciting serial, one of Republics best."  They especially note "some of the most beautifully photographed and edited action sequences in the history of cliffhangers." 

Cline writes that the sight of seeing the hero "jump right into his own fights" rather than have the camera cut between an actor and a stuntman, more than compensated for the reveal in the final chapter when the actor playing the Masked Marvel removes his mask and is clearly not the same actor playing the part in every other scene.  This scene is described as almost anticlimactic and "must have been just a little embarrassing." {{cite book
