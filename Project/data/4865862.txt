 Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett.   Though Levin is credited as the director and Flackett as the writer, in the films DVD commentary the two reveal that they collaborated on both tasks. Little Manhattan depicts the story of ten-year-old Gabes realization that girls can be pretty and nice to be with. The story takes place, and was filmed on location, in Manhattan, mostly in the Upper West Side. The film stars Josh Hutcherson and Charlie Ray in the leading roles of the two children.  It was Rays first film role having never previously attended an audition. The character of Rosemary at the kindergarten stage, seen in a flashback, was played by the writer-director teams real-life daughter.

==Plot== The Carlyle, where the young twosome finally hold hands. After the show, Rosemarys parents tell them to say goodnight and her parents go to get milk. After the parents leave, Rosemary starts talking to Gabe, which he interrupts by kissing her. His daily exploits are followed and encouraged by the friendly male elevator operator at his building.

The Telescos life is in contrast to Gabes; he lives with his soon-to-be-divorcing parents (Cynthia Nixon and Bradley Whitford), who have declared an awkward truce while waiting for their divorce to be finalized. As their relationship progresses, Gabe begins to question what is happening to him and why he is falling in love with Rosemary. When things seem to be going perfectly, Gabes world is suddenly turned upside down when he and Rosemary are assigned new sparring partners. Gabe is instantly jealous of Rosemarys new partner: a tall, blonde boy named Tim Staples, whos much better at karate than he is, and he is with a new partner, who is David Betanahu. With their remaining time running out, Gabe tries to move closer to Rosemary but only drives her away. In a desperate move to win Rosemary back, Gabe tests for his yellow belt, but fractures his hand in a painful (and failed) attempt to break a board.
 Sheep Meadow". He returns home to find his parents laughing over their honeymoon recollections. Gabe is pleased and surprised when his father says he "cleared out some old stuff" and his parents appear to have reconciled. They happily go out for dinner, and as the movie ends, Gabe, narrating, summarizes what Rosemary meant to him: "...Im never gonna get another first love. That one is always gonna be her."
