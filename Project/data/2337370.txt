The Specialist is a 1994 American action film directed by Luis Llosa, starring Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone and James Woods. 

==Plot==
In 1984, Captain Ray Quick and Colonel Ned Trent, explosives experts working for the CIA, are on a mission to blow up a car transporting a South American drug dealer. But when the car appears, a little girl is inside with the dealer. Ray insists they abort the mission, but Ned intends to see it through and allows the explosion to happen, resulting in the deaths of both the drug dealer and the girl. Angered by the girls wrongful death, Ray savagely beats Ned and flees, effectively resigning from the CIA.

Years later, in Miami, Ray works as a freelance hit man. Desperate people contact him via an Internet bulletin board and he takes the cases that interest him. Ray specializes in "shaping" his explosions, building and planting bombs that blow up only the intended target while leaving innocent bystanders unharmed.

He answers ads placed by a woman named May Munro and speaks to her often to decide if he should take the job or not. During the talks he becomes intrigued by her story, coupled with the fact that he sees how attractive she is while following her. She is the only child of parents who were killed by Tomas Leon and his men. Against his better judgment, and pushed by her insistence that she will infiltrate the gang with or without him, Ray is persuaded to accept the job. Even though he has agreed, May ingratiates herself into Tomas world as Adrian Hastings.

Ned now works for Joe Leon, Tomas father and head of their crime organization. Once the hits on their lower level guys begin, they contact the chief of police to place Ned in their bomb squad. May tolerates Tomas and plays along as his girlfriend so she can watch the hits one by one. It is revealed after the second target is killed that May has actually been forced into a partnership with Ned, whose goal was to coax Ray out of hiding. After the job in South America went wrong, Ned was dismissed from the CIA and is intent on revenge.

When the trap for Tomas is set, May is in the room; the resulting explosion appears to kill them both. When Ned goes to Joe to pay his respects, he is left alive only so he can find Ray and bring him to Joe before Tomas is buried. Both Ray and Ned believe that May is dead, yet Ray discovers that bulletin board messages are still being posted. He responds to one, quickly realizing that it is a trap set by Ned and the bomb squad, and baits Ned into an explosive tirade.

When he goes to the funeral of Adrian Hastings, Ray finds that May is alive. She went to the funeral to see if Ray would attend. They go to the Fontainebleau Hotel where they have sex, after which she leaves. Meanwhile, Ned has gone to the church and learns that the person in the casket is not May. She runs into Ned in the hotel lobby and makes an excuse as to why she did not tell him that she was alive. A henchman is ordered to take her to the car and on the way she asks to use the restroom. Once there, she uses a cell phone to warn Ray. He rigs the hotel room to explode, and when Neds henchmen enter the room it detonates, breaking the entire room off into the ocean.

In a final showdown, Ray and May are cornered in Rays own booby-trapped warehouse. Ned pursues them, but is done in by his own hubris when he steps on a bomb. After the entire warehouse goes up due to the chain of bombs exploding, it appears that all inside have been killed.

The next day Joe reads about the incident at the warehouse. He then opens the mail brought to him and finds a necklace. It contains a picture of Mays parents, which then explodes. After hearing the blast and knowing all responsible for her parents death are dead, Ray asks how she feels, to which she responds, "Better."

==Trivia==

*In January 1993 the L.A. Times listed The Specialist as the best unproduced thriller script in Hollywood, based on a poll of 40 agents, producers and studio executives.

*In the original version of the script the main characters name was Earl Quick.

*Mario Van Peebles was attached to direct the movie in 1991 but bailed.

*Steven Seagal was offered the chance to star and direct this film but he wanted $9 million for it. The studio didnt want to pay him that much and offered it to Sylvester Stallone instead.

*The producers got Sylvester Stallone to do the movie by threatening to replace him with Warren Beatty if he didnt commit himself to the project within a fifteen-minute deadline.
 Se7en (1995).

*When Sylvester Stallone enters his computer to activate the massive explosion of his home near end of film, the password he uses is "Top of the world, Ma." This is a slight paraphrase of Jimmy Cagneys last line in White Heat (1949), just before Cagney shoots into the large gas storage unit hes standing on, causing massive explosions. ("Made it, Ma. Top of the world!")

*Sylvester Stallone demanded for some of the scenes with James Woods to be cut out of the movie and for some of his scenes to be re-shot in order to have more screen time. The reason for that is because Stallone was worried that Woods would "steal" the movie away because of his acting skills. Stallone also cut out some Rutger Hauers scenes from Nighthawks (1981) for the same reasons.

*Eric Roberts was cast as James Munroe in The Expendables, in a screenplay written by Stallone.  His character in the The Specialist was part of the crew that killed May Munros parents.

===Critical reception===
Despite being a box office hit, critical reception was overwhelmingly negative as it has a 4% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews. 

Although May Munro was supposed to have watched her parents get killed by Tomas Leon as a child, Eric Roberts is only two years older than Sharon Stone.

Roger Ebert gave it two stars out of four, stating that "The Specialist is one of those films that forces the characters through torturous mazes of dialogue and action, to explain a plot that is so unlikely its not worth the effort. You know a movies in trouble when the people in line at the parking garage afterward are trying to figure out what the heroines motivations were." 
 John Wilsons book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of "The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made".
