 fedora sailing through the forest."

==Plot== bookie Bernie Bernbaum, Leo goes against Toms advice and extends his protection to Bernie. Bernie is the brother of Verna Bernbaum, who has begun a relationship with Leo while carrying on an affair with Tom.

Tom tries everything he can to convince Leo to give Bernie up to Caspar to end the war; he attempts to convince Leo that Verna is playing him to protect her brother, but Leo will not be swayed. After an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom reveals his affair with Verna to Leo to prove that she is dishonest. Leo beats Tom, and turns his back on both of them.

Tom is commanded to kill Bernie in the woods at Millers Crossing to prove his loyalty. Bernie pleads with Tom to spare him, saying "Look in your heart."  Tom fires his gun to fake the killing and tells Bernie to run and hide.

Caspar assumes Leos position as boss of the city, controlling the Police and using them to destroy Leos operations. Meanwhile, Tom begins sowing discord between Caspar and his trusted enforcer, Eddie Dane. Upon finding that his men didnt actually see Tom kill Bernie, Dane takes Tom back to Millers Crossing to see if Bernies body is there. Tom nearly cracks as they approach the location, but they find a body with its face shot in. Unknown to Tom, Bernie has returned, and killed Danes friend Mink, placing the body where his should have been. Bernie holds this over Toms head and tries to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar.

Tom uses Minks unknown whereabouts to convince Caspar that Eddie Dane has betrayed him. Dane denies it, and Caspar has to decide whom he believes, and whom he will kill. In a rage, he beats Eddie Dane before shooting him in the head. Tom then arranges a meeting with Bernie, but sends Caspar instead. Bernie gets the jump on Caspar and kills him. Tom arrives and tricks Bernie into giving up his gun, saying they can blame Eddie Dane, then reveals that Dane is dead, and that he intends to kill Bernie in retribution for blackmailing Tom. Bernie again begs for mercy, saying "Look in your heart", but Tom asks "What heart?" and shoots him.

With Caspar and Eddie Dane dead, Leo resumes his post as top boss. Verna has won her way back into Leos good graces, and she reacts coldly to Tom. On the day Bernie is buried, Leo announces that Verna has proposed to him, and offers Tom his job back. Tom refuses, and remains behind, watching as Leo departs.

== Production ==
While writing the screenplay, the Coen brothers tentatively titled the film The Bighead—their nickname for Tom Reagan. The first image they conceived was that of a black hat coming to rest in a forest clearing; then, a gust of wind lifts it into the air, sending it flying down an avenue of trees. This image begins the films opening credit sequence.
 Baby Boom one night, they returned to New York City and wrote Barton Fink (in three weeks) before resuming the Millers Crossing screenplay.

The budget was reported by film industry magazines as $14 million, but the Coens claimed in interviews that it was only $10 million. During the casting process, they had envisioned Trey Wilson (who played Nathan Arizona in their previous film Raising Arizona) as gangster boss Leo OBannon, but two days before the first day of principal photography Wilson died from a brain haemorrhage. Finney was subsequently cast.
 Hamlet at the time. J. E. Freeman was cast and the name of the character was changed to The Dane, while Stormare went on to be featured in Fargo (film)|Fargo and The Big Lebowski.

The city in which the story takes place is unidentified, but the film was shot in New Orleans as the Coen Brothers were attracted to its look. Ethan Coen commented in an interview, "There are whole neighborhoods here of nothing but 1929 architecture. New Orleans is sort of a depressed city; it hasnt been gentrified. Theres a lot of architecture that hasnt been touched, store-front windows that havent been replaced in the last sixty years." 
 New Orleans police would arrive semi-regularly to assess fines for permits that the film crew had already procured. Joel Coen commented to Premiere (magazine)|Premiere during shooting, "They are acting precisely like the cops that were depicting in the movie, and they dont even care!" 

== Influences ==
Millers Crossing contains references to many gangster films and film noir. Many situations, characters and dialogue are derived from the work of Dashiell Hammett, particularly his 1931 novel The Glass Key. There are some parallels between the two stories, and many scenes and lines are culled directly from this novel. In particular, the relationship between Tom and Leo in the film mirrors the relationship between Ned Beaumont and Paul Madvig, the principal characters of the Hammett novel. Francis Moraes|Moraes, Francis. (17 March 2010).  .     

Another important Hammett source was his 1929 novel Red Harvest, which details the story of a gang war in a corrupt Prohibition-era American city, a war initiated by the machinations of the main character. While Millers Crossing follows the plot and main characters of The Glass Key fairly closely, the film has no direct scenes, characters, or dialogue from Red Harvest.  

== Reception == video and DVD sales. The film was critically acclaimed, with a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 66 on Metacritic. 
 David Thomson calls the film "a superb, languid fantasia on the theme of the gangster film that repays endless viewing."  Of Turturros performance he says "This could be the finest work of one of our best supporting actors". Roger Ebert gave it 3/4 stars, stating "It is likely to be most appreciated by movie lovers who will enjoy its resonance with films of the past."
