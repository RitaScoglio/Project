==Synopsis==
A womans mistakes come back to haunt her in a terrifying and very literal manner in this mind-bending thriller. Dr. Samantha Goodman (Kate Greenhouse) is a clinical psychiatrist who works with patients at an institution for the criminally insane. Things have not been rosy for Sam lately -- shes been violently attacked by one of her patients, her marriage to husband David (Gordon Currie) is in bad shape, and she has an inoperable brain tumor thats growing at an alarming rate.

Sam needs a weekend away from the city, but what David has set up isnt especially relaxing for her -- a short holiday at a remote cabin, where David will be editing his latest book with the help of Sams younger, attractive sister Melody (Iris Graham). As Sam watches sparks begin to fly between her sister and her husband, Harlan Pyne (Aidan Devine) and his friend Adrian (Dov Tiefenbach) break into the cabin and announce their presence by shooting Sams pet dog.

Harlan is a convicted sex offender and murderer who was placed under Sams care in the institution and wasnt happy with the experimental treatment he received; having escaped, he and Adrian have tracked her down and decide to take revenge by forcing Sam, Melody, and David to participate in a series of strange and humiliating games. 

The Dark Hours was the first feature-length film from director Paul Fox, who subsequently directed the Douglas Coupland scripted comedy, Everythings Gone Green, as well as a number of successful Canadian television series.

==Reception==
 
The Dark Hours garnered recognition and awards from numerous international festivals, including Montreals Fantasia Film Festival, Scotlands Dead By Dawn Film Festival, Austins Fantastic Fest and the Sitges-Catelonian International Film Festival in Spain.
 Chris Anderson states that the film suffered more than any other film released that year from the inefficiencies of theatrical distribution. A further   on his blog confirmed his judgement that the film did not lack for quality at all, only for marketing and distribution.
