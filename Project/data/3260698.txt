TMNT premiered theatrically on March 23, 2007. It was a commercial success, grossing $95 million worldwide for a budget of $34 million, but received mixed reviews from film critics. Its release coincided with tie-in products including toys, comics and video games.

==Plot== parallel universe Master Splinter Leonardo to Donatello works IT specialist, Michelangelo works Raphael works Casey Jones.
 New York Karai and the Foot Clan to search the city for the thirteen beasts before the portal opens again. Raphael encounters Casey, who reveals his knowledge of Raphaels double identity and joins him in hunting criminals.

Winters, who is actually the still-immortal Yaotl, reanimates his generals with his companys advanced technology, but they remain made of stone. Leo returns to the sewer, meeting Splinter. Splinter forbids the Turtles from fighting until they can act as a team again. While training, the Turtles encounter one of the thirteen beasts called the Big Foot battling the Foot Clan. The Turtles engage the Big Foot, going against Leo and Splinters orders.

Eventually, the Generals and the Foot Clan captured the Sea Monster. When Raphael visits Casey, they encounter the Vampire Succubor and witness its capture by the Foot Clan and the Stone Generals, who spot them and knock Raphael unconscious. Casey takes him back to the apartment while April calls the Turtles for help and reveals the identities of Yaotl and his Generals. After being revived, Raphael suggests they pursue Yaotl, but Leo forbids him to go until Splinter gives out the order and so Raphael goes out to investigate alone as Nightwatcher.

Leo, Donny and Mikey return to their sewer home to plan their next move, where Donny discovers the reopening of the portal will be directly over Winters skyscraper headquarters. Splinter informs Leo that his team is incomplete, and that he knows what he must do. After eleven monsters have been captured, General Aguila questions Yaotls actions. The Generals conspire against Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal.

Raphael encounters one of the remaining monsters called the Jersey Devil but drives him off. Leo has been following him, wanting to put an end to the Nightwatchers vigilante acts, but when Raph is revealed, they battle. Raph breaks Leos twin swords and seems as though he is about to kill him but runs off instead. Immediately after Raph flees, the Generals ambush Leo, who is shot with a poison dart and too weak to fight them. Raph hears him scream in the distance as hes taken hostage and doubles back in pursuit, but he fails to get there in time. He takes Leos broken sabers back to Splinter and explains what happened.

The Generals intend to substitute Leo for the thirteenth missing beast and Raphael decides to make amends for his reckless mistakes by rescuing Leo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his Generals treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: He wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The Generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer Earth under their command.

==Production==
A computer graphics imagery (CGI) TMNT movie was first announced in 2000 in film|2000, with John Woo supposedly at the helm. That movie languished in development hell and Woo ultimately moved on to other projects. 

TMNT, executive produced by the TMNT co-creator Peter Laird, departs from the previous films live action style and is the first CGI film in the series. Writer/director Kevin Munroe said that he wanted to do total CGI instead of live action and CGI turtles because it would be easier for the audience to "suspend disbelief for such an offbeat story" as there would be no break in the reality between CGI and live action.  Producer Tom Gray explained that the decision to depart from the live action series was due to escalating budgets for the three films, and with each film making less than its predecessor, a CGI film became a reality.    For example, the first film made $135.2 million on a budget of $13.5 million, and the third made $44 million on a budget of $21 million.  Orange Sky Golden Harvests rights to the franchise had expired, and Gray said the question arose there over a CGI TMNT film in 2004.

===Critical response===
 

TMNT has a 34% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 115 reviews with an average rating of 5/10, and the consensus being "TMNTs art direction is splendid, but the plot is non-existent and the dialogue lacks the irony and goofy wit of the earlier TMNT movies."  Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score from film critics, calculated an average rating score of 41 out of 100 based on 21 reviews. 

Claudia Puig of USA Today gave a negative review, stating that the film "is trying for a new image. But it takes more than an awkward title attempting to sound cool to overcome its mundane plot and silly dialogue."  Michael Ordona of the Los Angeles Times wrote that "despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures, the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously."  Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe called the film "a junk-food pastry. The plot is the wrapper. The action is the oily sponge cake. And the message - family, family, family - is the processed cream filling." 

Conversely, Todd Gilchrist of IGN gave the film a positive review, calling it "a fun, action-filled adventure that will satisfy longtime fans and generate a legion of new ones, whether it be by virtue of simple storytelling, solid CGI,  choreographed action, or just the spirit and energy that only the Turtles can create."  Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post felt that the film "is technically superb and quite enjoyable as long as you dont bang your head against the plot, which will cause hot flashes, premature aging and fallen arches."  According to Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the film is "not so dark or scary as to keep most kids away" and it "has a cool, noirish sheen. Theres an attention to detail in the visuals and sound design that pushes it up several notches above most kiddie fare."
