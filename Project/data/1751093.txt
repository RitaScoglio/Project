==Plot==
Willy Grogan is a small-time boxing promoter based in the Catskills resort region of Cream Valley, New York. He owns the Grogans Gaelic Gardens inn. He is a contemptible man and is in debt and pays little attention to the woman who loves him, Dolly, a chain-smoking, love-starved woman residing at the camp. Into their midst comes Walter Gulick, a young man recently discharged from the Army who loves the peaceful setting almost as much as he loves working on old cars. Walters simple goal is to go into business as a mechanic at a nearby garage.

Willys younger sister, Rose, shows up unexpectedly. She and Walter immediately hit it off. The obsessively protective Willy doesnt want his kid sister falling for some "grease monkey" mechanic and two-bit boxer. Dolly is envious of the young couples romance and resents Willys interference.

One day, Walter, in need of work, accepts an offer of five dollars to be a sparring partner and decks one of Willys top fighters. Willy is persuaded to let this "Galahad" take a shot in a legitimate ring. Both men are reluctant, but each has a need for the money. Walter begins working out under the watchful eye of Willys top trainer, Lew.

After several successes in the ring, Walter is readied for his biggest fight. Gangsters want him to take a dive so that Willy can pay off his debts to them, but "Galahad" throws his muscle behind Willy and emerges victorious. He wins the big fight against Ramon "Sugar Boy" Romero as well as Willys approval, retiring undefeated to his vintage car and his new love.
