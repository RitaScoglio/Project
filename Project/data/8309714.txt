I know, I was the producers assistant (to Jack Janda) for the last 3 weeks of filming and all I did was do the daily in/out of the money. Three quarters of it went to buying and processing of the film stock as it was shot on actual celluloid. I know we went a bit over by the time we wrapped and with post it possibly went to 400k. But at the time of shooting it was just a mere 200k.
