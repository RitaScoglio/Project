==Plot==

Gabriella (Perabo) is a woman who is living in New York, having gotten a freelance job at a magazine for two months. She calls her fiance back home in her small town (starting off the conversation with "Good morning, baby.") the day before shes set to come back home. As she leaves him a message on his machine, she checks her e-mail, only to find that he left her an e-mail saying that he met someone else, saying that the distance was too much for him.

Gabriella then wanders around the city, bumping into a young man whom she calls an idiot. She finally meets her friend in a park, who asks to meet her tomorrow, as that will be her last day in New York. The next day, Gabriella is seen sitting on a park bench, wearing a red wig - "I wanted to be someone else today," she explains. As the two friends sit, the friend mentions how she misses the old New York, with the grime and crime giving the city an edge. Gabriella, however, still enjoys New York as it is. When she gets back, Gabriella is given a small gift by her landlady - a small plastic globe with "I Love NY", so that shell have something to remember the city by. Getting back to her apartment, she gets a message from her fiance, Max, who says that hes sorry and he misses her - he wants to make things right when she gets home.

The following morning, Gabriella is hailing a cab with her belongings, when the handsome man from the other day comes out of the first cab that stops. When he asks if shes going somewhere, Gabriealla stops, smiles, and says that "Im coming home", slamming the taxi door shut. She then watches the handsome man walk off, sits down on the stoop, and calls her mom on the cell phone with a smile on her face.
