}} Mainframe Animation and distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. It was released on DVD in other countries in 2005, until it was eventually released in North America on February 21, 2006.  It is the third and final installment in the Stuart Little trilogy, but unlike its two predecessors, it is entirely animated. The characters are based on those in E. B. Whites book Stuart Little.

==Plot==
Stuart and his family (and Monty who stows away in the car) are going camping. When they get there, Stuart meets a smooth-talking skunk named Reeko who is forced to give food to "The Beast". Stuart and George join the "Lake Scouts" which Stuart has trouble in. But Reeko makes a deal with The Beast, resulting in Snowbell getting captured by him and Stuart goes off on an adventure to save him. Eventually, Stuart and his friends attempt trick the Beast into falling into a trap covered with sticks and leaves which doesnt work. Reeko shows up with a group of forest animals. Reeko taunts the Beast and the Beast roars at him. Reeko turns around, yells a Kung Fu cry, and sprays the Beast with all his might. The Beast is taken away to a zoo and Stuart earns a gold kerchief. Reeko tells Stuart that he (Reeko) was wrong to betray him. Stuart bids farewell to his friends as he, George, Eleanor, Frederick, Snowbell, and Monty head back home and live happily ever after.

==Cast notes==
Corey Padnos replaced Jonathan Lipnicki as he was too old to reprise the role of George despite it being an animated film. Kevin Schon replaced Nathan Lane as Snowbell for unknown reasons. Rino Romano replaced Steve Zahn for the voice role for Monty. Martha also appeared in this film just like she did in Stuart Little 2. However, her only words consisted of babbling noises and a single line. It is unknown who voiced her nor do the credits reveal her voice performer.

===Character notes===
Margalo, Stuarts love interest who appeared in Stuart Little 2, does not appear and is never mentioned in Stuart Little 3.

==Reception==
James Plath of Reels.com rated it 2.5 out of 4, saying "Kids will still like it because the storyline is engaging, the color palette is bright and cheery, the songs are upbeat and pleasant enough, and the messages about good behavior, perseverance, and belonging are worthwhile."  Sloan Freer of Radiotimes.com rated it 2 out of 5, saying, "The quality plunges drastically in this uninspired direct-to-video sequel. Gone is the charming mix of live action and CGI used in the original two films, replaced by full animation whose flatness and simplicity is symbolic of the entire tale. Surprisingly, the core voice talent remains the same with Michael J Fox, Geena Davis, and Hugh Laurie wasting their efforts on a weak plot that sees boy mouse Stuart demonstrate his bravery when Snowbell the family cat is kidnapped during the Little clans lakeside vacation. Undemanding humour, a sprinkling of mild peril, and the obligatory life lessons offer enough substance to keep the very young happy, but only the short running time will impress anyone older."
