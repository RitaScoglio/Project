 alligator named Bolt Jenkins. He was "born as a handbag" and told he would never walk again. A song during his story reveals that he lives in the slums. After seeing a frog named Boris Amphibiensky break the world record for the high jump, Jenkins has an epiphany, and becomes determined to break the record. Jenkins goes on to set world records in the high jump, the pole vault, and later the 100 meter dash. Jenkins sacrifices his gold medal in the hundred meter dash to African competitor and favorite Kit Ngogo, whom Jenkins considers to be his superior.

== History == boycott the Dolby surround sound via magnetically striped 35mm film, had its debut at the 1980 Miami Film Festival , where it was well received. It was released in various countries overseas during the summer season that same year. 
 Showtime nationwide, as well as intermittently during the early to mid-1990s on The Disney Channel, and also on Philadelphias PRISM (TV channel)|PRISM.  It was also shown on an NBC affiliate station on July 4, 1982. 

Considering that the film was produced in 1979, several music-video-like sequences accompany its soundtrack by 10ccs bassist Graham Gouldman, uncommon at the time. 

Among those who worked on Animalympics were art director/animator  . Brad Bird went on to work as story editor of The Simpsons, and later achieved even greater success writing and directing The Iron Giant, The Incredibles  and Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille.

Director Lisberger went on to conceive, co-write and direct the science fiction classic Tron, which some of the Animalympics crew were involved in. Its soundtrack supervisor was Michael Fremer, who was involved in Animalympics as a co-writer, voice artist, dialogue/music track editor and sound mix supervisor. Fremer went on to supervise the Academy Award nominated soundtrack to  Tron  

==Soundtrack==
A&M Records in the USA, and Mercury Records in Europe released an Animalympics soundtrack album, which has long been out of print. The music on this soundtrack was written and produced entirely by Graham Gouldman, who performed the tracks himself along with other members of 10cc (Gouldman was the bassist for the band at the time).
