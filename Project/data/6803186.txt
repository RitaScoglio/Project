==Plot== poker online reading his last hand.
 Las Vegas to play in a high-stakes cash game.  He buys Alex in and watches the kid take a few beatings and lose money.  Tommy pulls him off the table and reveals that Alex has a tell, which he corrects.  Alex turns the game around and ends up cashing out ahead.  Tommy suggests Alex relax a little and gets him to approach a beautiful woman at the bar named Michelle (Shannon Elizabeth).  Alex awkwardly approaches her and convinces her to go on a date with him, and she spends the night with him.  

Tommy wants to take Alex to Louisiana to play in a poker tournament, but Alex is supposed to start his job at his fathers law firm.  Alex convinces his dad to give him a few extra days under the pretext of taking a trip with his friend.  Tommy tells his wife he has to go to Cleveland for work and the pair head to the tournament.  On the first day, Alex does really well and builds up a chip lead.  Overnight, Tommy warns Alex that the other players will try to keep him awake with distractions such as crank phone calls and knocks at the door.  Alex doesnt listen and loses sleep to the distractions, resulting in him busting out of the tournament.  Upon returning home, Tommy is confronted by his wife Helen about the money hes been using.  He admits to bankrolling Alex but swears he hasnt played a hand himself.  Unmoved, Helen packs her things and leaves Tommy.

Tommy takes Alex back to Las Vegas for another tournament, during which he tries to reconnect with Michelle but she doesnt return his calls.  Alex does well at first but starts getting flustered when he runs into another tough female opponent.  Alex finally finds his stride, finishing the tournament in the money and making $120,000.  Michelle finally calls Alex back, and the two spend the night together.  Alex tries to convince her to spend more time with him, but she tells him her father is in town and she has to leave.  Later that night, while celebrating his win with Tommy, he sees Michelle with another man and realizes she is a prostitute.  Tommy tacitly admits to hiring her to help Alex relax, and an enraged Alex storms off.  The next morning, Alex leaves Tommy his share of the winnings at the hotel desk and tells him never to talk to him again.

Alex returns home to his angry parents, who know hes been playing poker rather than work.  When his father reminds him who paid for his law school, Alex throws his $60,000 at him.  Shocked at the money Alex has made, his parents reluctantly agree to let him compete in the World Poker Tour tournament in a few weeks.  Tommy, deciding he has nothing to lose, enters the tournament as well.  The two play for several days, with Alex quickly building up a chip lead and Tommy slowly grinding his way up until both players reach the final table.  That evening, Helen returns to Tommy at his hotel and apologizes for making him stay away from poker for so long.  Alexs parents also arrive, finally supporting their sons poker playing.  The next day, they both eliminate several players until its down to just the two of them.  In the final hand, Tommy busts Alex out with a pocket pair of jacks.  

Later in the evening, Tommy confronts Alex to ask about his last hand.  Alex confirms Tommys suspicion that he had a lower pair than Tommy.  In a flashback, we see that Alex actually folded the winning hand in order to let Tommy have the title he wanted for so long.
