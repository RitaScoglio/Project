}} 1944 Republic 1940 20th The Mark of Zorro and Republic wasnt able to use the character himself, but still wanted to capitalize on it.  However, and despite the title, Zorro does not feature in this serial.  The hero(ine) is actually called The Black Whip throughout.

The serial is set in pre-statehood Idaho, and involves a fight to prevent and ensure statehood by the villains and heroes respectively.

Parts of this serial were reused as stock footage to pad out later serials such as Don Daredevil Rides Again (1951) and Man with the Steel Whip (1954)&nbsp;– despite the fact that both of those serials had male leads.

==Plot== Don Diego in Idaho fights a cabal of corrupt politicians as "The Black Whip" after her brother (the original Black Whip) is killed.
 marshal is meanwhile powerless to act outside his jurisdiction beyond the town boundary. Randolph Meredith, owner of the towns newspaper, as the Black Whip, opposes this scheme to defeat statehood, but one day he is killed after preventing yet another coup. Merediths sister Barbara, expert with a bullwhip and pistol, dons Randolphs black costume and mask and becomes "The Black Whip" in her brothers place, dealing a blow to Hammond and his gang each time they perform some heinous act in their efforts to keep the town, and their power over it, unchanged.
 US government agent Vic Gordon, Barbara (Linda Stirling) as The Black Whip is quite obviously female but, even after a bout of wrestling, the villains do not realise they arent fighting a man.  Some reference is made to this in the script, however, when the villains are trying to determine who the Black Whips secret identity could be:
{{quote | Hammond: Barbara Meredith, shes the Black Whip!
Baxter: She couldnt be! The Black Whips got to be a man! Hes outshot us, outrode us, and outfought us, stopped us at every turn! | Chapter Nine: Avalanche }}
Hammond orders her taken, but the day is saved when Vic Gordon discovers Barbaras secret and removes her from suspicion by appearing in her costume and overcoming her captors.  From this point on, despite relinquishing the costume at her insistence that she must continue as the Black Whip, he tends to assume the hero role while Barbara becomes slightly more of a traditional damsel in distress, even while she still holds her own in successive violent confrontations with Hammonds henchmen, and more than once saves Vics life.

After the town has finally voted on whether or not to accept statehood, most of Hammonds gang are gunned down while attempting to steal the ballot boxes. Hammond escapes, and secretly trails and confronts Barbara in her cave when she removes her mask. He takes aim, but is struck down by the Black Whips stallion. The reign of terror has ended. Vic remains with Barbara and the marshall to help maintain peace in the territory.

 The Tiger Woman.  It had been Republics standard pattern to produce two 12-chapter serials and two 15-chapter serials each year since 1938 but 1944 was the last year that occurred.  In fact, Republic would only produce two more 15-chapter serials, Manhunt of Mystery Island and The Purple Monster Strikes, both in 1945 and both starring Linda Stirling.
