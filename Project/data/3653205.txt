==Plot==
The film is set in New America in the year 2097, two decades after a nuclear apocalypse.

==Critical reaction==
Rotten Tomatoes records an aggregate rating of 60% from 5 reviews.  Village Voice found it "self-impressed film", and considered it an over-deliberate attempt to create a cult film, which failed, "funnier on paper than in reality", making a negative comparison to the Mad Max franchise.
