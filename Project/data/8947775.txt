 screwball romantic Jimmy the Gent together in 1934, and had wanted to find another opportunity to work together.

The screenplay was written by Kenneth Earl, M. M. Musselman, and twins Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein. Note that the basic plot owes much to It Happened One Night, wherein heiress seeks to marry playboy of whom father disapproves, ending up with charming working man.
 

==Plot==

 Harry Davenport). Joan escapes into an abandoned mine. When Steve follows her, they are trapped by a cave-in. Steve finds a way out, but hides it from Joan on the advice of Pop. Believing that they are going to die, Joan re-examines her frivolous life with great regret. Steve admits he loves her, but when he kisses her, she tastes food on his lips and realizes he has found a way out. They exit the mine to find that Alan has tracked them down, accompanied by a Nevada judge. 

Steve does not object when Alan and Joan get married, hiding the fact that Bonanza is in California and therefore the wedding is invalid. The "newlyweds" board another aircraft, but when Joan figures out that they are not really married, she parachutes out to be reunited with Steve.

==Reception==
The New York Times dismissed The Bride Came C.O.D. as "a serviceable romp."   Reviewer Archer Winston in The New York Post succinctly put it: "Okay, Jimmie and Bette. Youve had your fling. Now go back to work."  Despite the critical reviews, the film was a popular favorite, and one of the years top 20 box-office films. 

For her part, in her later biographies and interviews, Bette Davis derided The Bride Came C.O.D., sarcastically saying, "it was called a comedy."  She would also complain that "all she got out of the film was a derriere full of cactus quills." 

A year later, animator Chuck Jones spoofed the film in the Warner Bros. Conrad Cat cartoon, "The Bird Came C.O.D."   More recent reviews have described the film as neither "memorable nor funny"  but that the two stars still are worth watching even in a forgettable formula feature.
