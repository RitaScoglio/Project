 Detective Alonzo Harris, a departure from his usual roles, was particularly praised and earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 74th Academy Awards. His co-star Ethan Hawke was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as rookie cop, Officer Jake Hoyt.

==Plot== Detective Alonzo Harris, a highly decorated LAPD narcotics officer. In Alonzos car, the officer sees teenage Mara Salvatrucha gang members dealing drugs in a park. Alonzo confiscates the drugs and tells Jake to take a hit from the marijuana. Jake refuses, but Alonzo puts a gun to his head and says Jakes failure to use drugs could get him killed by a street dealer. Jake relents and smokes the marijuana.  Alonzo then tells him the marijuana was laced with Phencyclidine|PCP. While driving, Jake notices a female high school student named Letty being sexually assaulted. Jake tackles and  subdues the attackers, while Alonzo watches. Alonzo tells Letty to leave. Jake objects but Alonzo says that street justice has been served—the two men lost their money and crack, and Lettys cousins may take revenge. Jake finds Lettys wallet on the ground and takes it.
 Baldwin Village. Afterward, Alonzo meets with a group of high-ranking police officials dubbed the "Three Wise Men". They tell Alonzo they know he owes money to the Russian Mafia and suggest that he leave town. But Alonzo insists he can control the situation and gets permission to "cash in on an account". Alonzo later tells Jake that he had to give Sandmans money to the Three Wise Men to obtain an arrest warrant.

Alonzo takes Jake and three other narcotic officers to the home of Roger, a drug dealer and former police officer the duo visited earlier. Using the warrant, they seize several million dollars from underneath the floor of Rogers kitchen, but Jake refuses to take his share of the cash. Alonzo then kills Roger and arranges the scene to appear like a justified shooting. When Jake refuses to lie, Alonzo does an impression of a news reporter saying that a rookie cop was killed in a narcotics raid. Jake responds to the threat by seizing Alonzos shotgun, prompting the officers to enter a Mexican standoff. Alonzo calms his associates and claims that the LAPD will run a blood test on Jake, which would reveal the PCP in his blood, from the joint he made him smoke earlier. He also offers him to falsify the result in exchange for Jakes cooperation. Jake reluctantly agrees to his machination.

Alonzo drives Jake to the home of a   or be killed himself. Jake realizes too late that Alonzo has paid Smiley to kill him and is subdued and dragged to the shower. There, the gang finds the wallet dropped by Letty, who is Smileys cousin. Smiley calls Letty, who confirms that a police officer risked his life to defend her. In gratitude for protecting his cousin, Smiley lets Jake go.

Jake returns to Saras apartment looking for Alonzo. He attempts to arrest Alonzo, but a gunfight ensues. Jake eventually subdues him, after which the local Bloods gang members and residents begin congregating to watch. Alonzo tries to get the crowd on his side by offering a reward to whoever kills Jake, but they have grown tired of Alonzos arrogance and allow Jake to walk away with the money. In an attempt to escape via Los Angeles International Airport, Alonzo is killed by the Russian Mafia and the broadcast of his death over the news is hauntingly similar to the one he used to taunt Jake.

==Production== CRASH unit completion of Rafael Pérez.   Fuqua wanted Washingtons character to be seductive and part of a machine, and not just a random rogue cop. In Washingtons own words: "I think in some ways hes done his job too well. He’s learned how to manipulate, how to push the line further and further, and, in the process, he’s become more hard-core than some of the guys hes chasing."  . Rediff.com. October 2006. Retrieved 2011-10-20. 

Fuqua also saw Hawkes character as generally honorable but so driven by ambition that he was willing to compromise his principles, particularly when following the charming and persuasive example of Washingtons character. He has said that he fought with studio executives who wanted to cut the Three Wise Men scene, thinking it slowed the film. He insisted that the Wise Men scene was pivotal in establishing that at least some of Alonzos illegal actions were sanctioned by his superiors who regarded unethical behavior as a necessary evil.   
 Imperial Courts PJ Watts Crips, and Black P. Stones (Jungles)|B. P. Stones (a Bloods set). According to Fuqua, the actors and crew ended up receiving a warm welcome from local residents. When he was unable to shoot a scene directly on location, he recreated the locations on sets. 

There were also two police officers on hand as technical advisors, Michael Patterson and Paul Lozada (the latter from the San Francisco Police Department). Washington, Hawke and other cast members also met with undercover police officers, local drug dealers, and gang members to help them understand their roles better.
