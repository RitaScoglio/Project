==Plot== cel animation origins, and become live-action characters (portrayed by Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander, and Rene Russo). The klutzy FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) and her boss Cappy von Trapment (Randy Quaid) inform President Signoff (James Rebhorn) that Fearless Leader intends to make himself the President by brainwashing the American public with his cable television network "RBTV" (short for "Really Bad Television"), with virtually nothing but mediocre spy film-based programming on the air. Karen is sent to a special lighthouse to bring Rocky and Bullwinkle to the real world. She succeeds, the Narrator being brought along as well but never being physically seen.
 Swedish guard named Ole.
 District Attorney (Jeffrey Ross) that celebrities are above the law.

The three then obtain an old biplane from a man named Old Jeb (Jonathan Winters), and escape Boris and Natasha again. The evil duo consider quitting their evil occupations and getting married, but then Fearless Leader calls on the phone. Afraid to admit they failed, they lie to Fearless Leader that they killed Rocky and Bullwinkle. Meanwhile, the plane the heroes fly in is unable to fly with all three aboard. Rocky flies Karen to New York City to stop Fearless Leader, while Bullwinkle flies the plane to Washington, D.C. and lands at the White House. The villains capture Karen and Rocky, whilst Cappy e-mails Bullwinkle to RBTVs headquarters to free them. A battle follows, with the heroes winning and convincing the American public to vote for whomever they want but to replant Frostbite Falls trees. Bullwinkle fiddles with the CDI and inadvertently zaps the villains back to their two-dimensional cartoon forms, and ultimately to the internet.

At the films end, RBTV becomes "Rocky and Bullwinkle Television" and Karen dates Ole to see the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie. Returning to Frostbite Falls, the narrator reunites with his mother, the trees are replanted, and Rocky ends the movie by flying through the air and spells the words The End. Then Rocky and Bullwinkle say good bye to the people.

==Reception==
Rocky and Bullwinkle received mixed reviews from critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying, "It was a funny movie for kids and it was a funny movie for adults, too, and it has an attitude towards itself and its in on the joke, and I really was surprised how much I liked it!" However, on a $76 million budget the film grossed $35 million worldwide.  The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes stated   "Though the film stays true to the nature of the original cartoon, the script is disappointing and not funny."
