Charlie Chan Carries On (1930) is the fifth novel in the Charlie Chan series by Earl Derr Biggers.

==Plot summary==
Inspector Duff, a Scotland Yard detective and friend of Chans, first introduced in Behind That Curtain, is pursuing a murderer on an around-the-world voyage; so far, there have been murders in London, France, Italy and Japan. While his ship is docked in Honolulu, the detective is shot and wounded by his quarry; though he survives, he is unable to continue with the cruise, and Chan takes his place instead. Eventually, after more murders, Chan finds the killer before the next port of call.

==Film adaptations== Charlie Chan trailer known to survive. 

However, Fox filmed a Foreign Language Version|Spanish-language version, using many of the same sets, using a Spanish-speaking cast, which was released under the title Eran Trece (There Were Thirteen). This used many of the same pieces of stock footage as the English-language version and the script was expanded somewhat based on the English-language script. This Spanish-language version is currently available as a bonus feature on the DVD release of Charlie Chan in Shanghai.

The film Charlie Chans Murder Cruise (1940), starring Sidney Toler, Olands successor in the role, was also based on the novel.
