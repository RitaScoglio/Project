==Plot   == dog walker/Yoga|yoga Venice Beach, California, who meets surgeon Kevin Fields (played by Michael Vartan). She thinks hes gay at first, based on a lie Fiona (Kevins ex-girlfriend) told her. But then Kevin asks her out, and Charlie believes that shes finally found the right man.
 newscaster who has recently been replaced by someone younger, and is in the midst of a Tantrum|meltdown. Loathing Charlie from the outset, Viola becomes even more distraught when Kevin proposes to Charlie. Fearing that shell lose her son the same way she lost her career, she sets out to destroy Kevin and Charlies relationship. With her trusted assistant, Ruby (Wanda Sykes) who is secretly working against her, she tries everything possible to drive Charlie away.

Charlie eventually catches on to Violas plan and fights back. On the wedding day, Viola turns up wearing a white dress instead of the dress specially made for her by Charlie. Then, suddenly, Violas own dreadful mother-in-law, Kevins grandmother, Gertrude Fields (Elaine Stritch), appears and they have an argument. Gertrudes resentment of Viola bears a very strong resemblance to Violas feelings toward Charlie. Gertrude even believes that her son, Kevins father had passed away years ago of "terminal disappointment," for which Gerturde holds Viola responsible. Viola immediately counters saying Gertrude is mainly responsible for the death of her son because as Viola said, Gertrude "smothered him to death" because she thought nobody was ever good enough for him. Charlie decides to back down as she witnesses Gertrude and Violas relationship. "Nothings going to change," she laments to Viola after Gertrude leaves the room, "In thirty years that will be us."
 epiphany and realizes that she wants Charlie to stay, and they reconcile which ends the feud. Charlie then explains to Viola that she wants her to stay too.

Charlie and Kevin then get married and when Charlie throws her wedding bouquet, Viola catches the flowers. As Charlie and Kevin drive away to their honeymoon, the film ends as Viola and Ruby walk out of the celebration..
