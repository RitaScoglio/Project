==Plot==
Prem (Salman Khan) lost his parents at an early age. He lives with his elder brother Rajesh (Mohnish Bahl) and uncle Kailashnath (Alok Nath). Rajesh manages the family business and his family is on the look-out for a suitable bride for him. Professor Siddharth Chaudhary (Anupam Kher) and Mrs. Chaudhary (Reema Lagoo) have two daughters, Pooja (Renuka Shahane) and Nisha (Madhuri Dixit). The Chaudhary couple and Kailashnath are old friends who meet again after several years. They arrange a marriage between Rajesh and Pooja. From their first meeting, Nisha and Prem start bickering lightheartedly with each other, and the fun and mischief continues throughout Pooja and Rajeshs wedding.

Prem has an amicable relationship with his warm-hearted sister-in-law. In time, Pooja and Rajesh discover that they are expecting a child. Professor and Mrs. Chaudhary are unable to come to Kailashnaths house for the ceremony marking the impending arrival of the baby. They send Nisha instead, who is present at the birth. Meanwhile, Nisha and Prem fall in love with each other, but keep it a secret. Professor and Mrs. Chaudhary come over to Kailashnaths house to celebrate the birth of their grandchild. When the time comes to part, they leave dejectedly, especially Prem. He and Nisha promise to each other that they will soon get together for ever.

One day, Pooja is invited to stay at her parents house, and Prem takes her there. When they arrive, Pooja learns that Prem and Nisha are in love, and gives Nisha a necklace as a token, promising to marry them. Shortly afterwards, Pooja goes to answer the phone, and she accidentally slips and falls down the stairs, and dies from a head injury. Everybody is shattered by the tragedy.

Nisha takes good care of her dead sisters son. Hence, her parents and Kailashnath feel that Nisha will be a great mother to the baby. They decide to marry Nisha off with Rajesh. Nisha overhears her parents talking about her marrying into Kailashnaths family. She mistakenly thinks that they are discussing her marriage to Prem, so she agrees. Later, at a pre-nuptial ceremony, she finds out that she is actually supposed to get married to Rajesh.

Prem and Nisha vow to sacrifice their love for Rajesh and the baby. Moments before the wedding is to begin, Nisha asks her dog Tuffy to give Prem the necklace that Pooja had given her, along with a letter. The letter and necklace fall into the hands of Rajesh. When he realizes that Prem and Nisha love each other, he halts the wedding and confronts both of them. In the end, Nisha and Prem marry each other with the consent of their families. The films title Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! appears and then rephrases to Hum Aapke Hain! (English: I am yours!) at the end of the film when Prem and Nisha get married.

==Production== Nadiya Ke Paar.  Barjatya used musical numbers to avoid treating some situations in a cliche manner, which resulted in so many songs that there were complaints during initial screenings of the film concerning its length and number of songs. Barjaytas grandfather, company founder Tarachand Barjatya loved the song "Dhiktana" so much that the film was nearly given that title. 

Barjatya later told India Abroad, "My attempt in this movie has been to reexpose the cinema-going public to the quintessential family life ... not to make people feel that they have come to see a movie, but make them feel as if they have come to visit a big joint family that is preparing for a wedding".     The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil.  From conception to finished product, the film took four years. 

The producers/distributors exercised a higher than normal level of control over their work. There was a limited release, a new form of television publicity, safeguards against video piracy, and a delay in the releasing of video tapes.   The film was also dubbed into the Telugu language and released with the title Premalayam.

==Analysis==
Author Patricia Uberoi classified Aapke Hain Koun..! a family film in two ways; it is about family relationships, and it is suitable for the entire family to watch. She said that the film is not about the two leads, but about the family, an ideal family.  Tejaswini Ganti has called the film a "paean to filial duty" for how the children are willing to sacrifice their love for the good of their families.  The family relationships are also noted for being different from the normal cinematic families of the time due to their mutual civility.  Rediff.com noted that "Though the film was initially dismissed as a wedding video, its success indicated that post-liberalisation, Indian audiences still clung to the comfort of the familiar."  Jigna Desai said that the films popularity was due to interactions of the families around the traditional folk wedding practices.  In his study on the response to the film, academic Vamsee Juluri concluded that the celebration of the family is HAHKs "most useful contribution to history". 

==Legacy and influence==
Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! is credited as being a defining moment in Hindi cinemas box office history, and the beginning of a revolution in the Indian film distribution system.   When it was released, cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television, home video, and film piracy.    The film was originally released in only a small number of theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities. Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television.   Also, the films lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre.  This film, in addition to the following years Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40% in just two years. 
 blockbuster new meaning in India. Box Office India said, "Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!   took business for films released afterwards to another level. To put into perspective how business changed   before Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! an all India share of 10 crore for a big film was regarded as blockbuster business but after Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! the blockbuster business figure went to 20 crore."   at todays exchange rate}}

Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! influenced many subsequent Hindi films. Avinash Ramchandani observed that the film was released at a time when most Hindi films contained violent plots. He wrote, "This movie changed it all. Since then we have had movies like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Akele Hum Akele Tum which have continued the trend towards non-violent love stories.  The film was also a trendsetter for glamorous family dramas and NRI-related films,   and started Bollywoods "big-fat-wedding-film" trend.  In 1998 a theatre company in London, where the film had played for a year, staged a production based on the film titled Fourteen Songs, Two Weddings and a Funeral.  Planet Bollywood has noted that no wedding is complete without some songs from this film,  and it has been used as a script to design wedding plans.  For years afterwards, women wanted to wear a purple sari like the one worn by Madhuri Dixit in the song "Didi Tera Devar Deewana". 

Filmmaker Karan Johar named it as the one film that changed his life. He said, "After seeing Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! I realized Indian cinema is about values, tradition, subtlety, romance. There is so much soul in it.   I decided to go ahead and be a filmmaker only after watching this film."  Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! belongs to a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943 film)|Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Sholay (1975), which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance.
