}} Argentine melodramatic western film directed by Leónidas Barletta and written by Enzo Aloisi. 

==Overview==
Los Afincaos (Sons of the Earth) was the first film ever produced by the major Argentine film company Teatro del Pueblo. Set in the Northern hills, the story concerns a pair of Indian brothers, leaders of their local tribe. The older of the brothers falls in love with a young school teacher, but rather than go through the courtship proceedings, he kidnaps and rapes the unfortunate girl. When she dies from grief, the younger brother avenges her death by killing his sibling. The acting and staging of Los Afincaos reveals a great deal about the lack of experience at such an early stage in Argentine feature film history.
