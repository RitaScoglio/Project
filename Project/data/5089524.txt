==Plot==
An orphan boy begins working in the house of a wealthy man named Ramnath ( , Darvesh Baba (Kader Khan) advises the mourning Sikandar to embrace the woes of life and find happiness in sadness, for then he would become the conqueror of fate. 

The film cuts to grown up Sikandar (Amitabh Bachchan), revealing he has amassed a fortune by turning in smugglers and thieves to the police and receiving the reward payouts. With all his wealth, he has managed to build an impressive house for himself and Mehroo, along with setting up a profitable business. He still has not forgotten Kaamna (Raakhee). She and her father have fallen on hard times, but they snub all offers from Sikandar to become reacquainted. When Sikandar tries to speak to Kaamna she demands that he never speak to her again. Sikandar is upset by this and becomes a heavy drinker. He also begins to visit Zohra Begums (Rekha) kotha (brothel) on a regular basis. Zohra falls into an unrequited love with Sikander and begins to refuse other clients.

One night in a bar, Sikandar is introducted to Vishal Anand (Vinod Khanna), a down-on-his-luck lawyer. A friendship is formed when Vishal risks his own life to save Sikandar from a bomb blast. Vishal and his mother move into Sikandars house.

A criminal named Dilawar (Amjad Khan) is in love with Zohra, and learns about her love for Sikandar. Dilawar confronts Sikandar and in the ensuing fight is thrashed by him. He swears to kill Sikandar.

At length Ramnath and Kaamna, who have been struggling financially, discover that Sikandar has been anonymously paying their bills. Ramnath goes to thank him. The two households become friendly, and Vishal begins to work with Ramnath. Encouraged, Sikandar tries to profess his love to Kaamna through a love letter. Because Sikandar himself is illiterate, Vishal transcribes the letter for him, but the plan backfires when Kaamna mistakes the letter as actually being from Vishal. Vishal is unaware that Kaamna is the girl Sikandar loves, and they begin to date. Sikandar, upon learning this, struggles with his emotions but decides he must sacrifice his love for the sake of his friendship with Vishal. He covers up any evidence of his feelings toward Kaamna, and at his urging, Vishal and Kaamna plan to marry.

Meanwhile, the marriage of Mehroo is at risk of being cancelled; her fianc√©s family have learned about Sikandars frequent visits to Zohra, and they object to the union on these grounds. Vishal, knowing Sikandar wont change, visits Zohra and offers to pay her if she will abandon Sikandar. Zohra, upon learning the reason, refuses the money but promises Vishal that she would sooner die than let Sikandar visit her again. Later, Sikandar arrives at Zohras. When she is unable to stop his entry, she kills herself by swallowing a diamond and dies in his arms.

Dilawar in the meantime has formed an alliance with Sikandars arch enemy, J. D. (Ranjeet), and upon learning of Zohras death hatches a plan to destroy Sikandar and his family. Kaamna and Mehroo are both preparing for their weddings;  J. D. and his henchmen kidnap Mehroo but Vishal follows them and rescues her. Dilawar kidnaps Kaamna, but Sikandar follows him. He rescues Kaamna and sends her home while he fights Dilawar. In the final battle, both Dilawar and Sikandar are mortally wounded and Dilawar is surprised to learn that Sikandar never loved Zohra. A dying Sikandar reaches the wedding of Kaamna and Vishal. Just as the wedding ceremony is completed, Sikandar collapses. His dying words inadvertently reveal his love for Kaamna, and Vishal sings him a reprise from the movies theme song: "Life is going to betray you someday... Death is your true love as it will take you along..." Sikandars entire life flashes before him and he dies in Vishals arms just as the song is completed. The film ends with the wedding having become a funeral.
