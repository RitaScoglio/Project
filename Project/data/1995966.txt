==Production==
Like The Jazz Singer, The Singing Fool was a melodrama with musical interludes, and as such was one of the film industrys first musical films. Produced during the transition period between silent film and talkies, the movie was released in both sound and silent versions. 

The Singing Fool was a part-talking feature, which featured a synchronized musical score with sound effects along with synchronized musical and talking sequences, although in this film roughly 66 minutes of talking and singing were included. {{Cite book

==Plot==
After years of hopeful struggle, Al Stone (Jolson) is on his way. "Im Sittin on Top of the World", he sings to an appreciative speakeasy crowd.  But, as Al discovers, getting there is one thing.  Staying there is another. Singing waiter Stone gets his huge break on a magical night when his song wows a big-time producer and a gold-digging showgirl he fancies.  Broadway success and marriage follow, but sure enough, hard times are on the way. Als fickle wife abandons him, taking the beloved son he calls Sonny Boy with her.  Heartbroken, Al becomes a devastated loner until friends from the speakeasy that launched his career rescue him from a life on the streets. Soon, Al is back in lights. But another crisis awaits: Sonny Boy is in the hospital and dying....

==Reception== Snow White Sergeant York in 1941. 
 John Mosher of The New Yorker also recommended the film, writing, "Fortunately, throughout this picture one has Al Jolsons own songs to listen to, for the story has been contrived to exploit to the full his special talents. Whenever the action begins to slump and lag, Al has only to step forward and do his stuff, and the day is saved."  One trade paper commentator stated that The Singing Fool "will be to talking pictures what The Birth of a Nation has been to silent pictures". 
 Sonny Boy—until his parents pulled him out of the movie business.   

"Sonny Boy" became the first song from a movie to sell over a million copies. It eventually sold over 3 million copies of sheet music, piano rolls and phonograph records.

==Songs==
* "Theres a Rainbow Round My Shoulder"
* "Golden Gate"
* "Im Sitting on Top of the World|Im Sittin on Top of the World"
* "It All Depends on You"
* "Keep Smiling at Trouble" Sonny Boy"
* "The Spaniard That Blighted My Life" (see below)

==Deleted scenes==
Al Jolsons rendition of "The Spaniard That Blighted My Life" is missing from extant prints of the film. This is due to a lawsuit initiated by the songs author, Billy Merson. Merson claimed that he, as a performer, owed his income to his own renditions of the song, and that Jolsons version would diminish his ability to earn a living. The song was removed from all prints of "The Singing Fool" shown in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, the only surviving copies of the film are also from the U.K., hence are missing the song. These copies also have the majority of the original decorative Warner Brothers title cards replaced with simple British made ones which were used to remove Americanisms which the British would not understand or appreciate (a common practice during the silent era). Only the soundtrack survives on extant Vitaphone discs.
