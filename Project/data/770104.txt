 1916 short short silent Eric Campbell and Edna Purviance.

==Synopsis== strike by the stagehands, and Purviance, who is unable to become an actress, dressing as a man and becoming a stagehand.
 

==Mention in The Celluloid Closet and Unknown Chaplin==
The film is significant to the history of homosexuality in the cinema, as it contains a joke about the subject, which was relatively unusual at the time. After Chaplin learns that Purviance is really a woman, he kisses her while on the set; at this point, a male stagehand enters and, thinking that Chaplin has kissed a man, starts acting in an overtly effeminate way until Chaplin kicks him. 

The documentary series Unknown Chaplin revealed previously unseen footage from this movie, including an alternate take where Purviances character is shown playing a harp, an outtake in which Edna, playing the guitar, starts laughing (the documentary supports the belief that Purviance and Chaplin were romantically involved at the time), and several takes of a scene in which Chaplins character narrowly misses having his feet chopped off by an axe (accomplished by filming the scene backwards) -- this scene was never used in the final film.

==Cast==
* Charles Chaplin - David (Goliaths assistant)
* Edna Purviance - The Girl Eric Campbell - Goliath (a stagehand)

==Sound version== Amedee Van Beuren of Van Beuren Studios, purchased Chaplins Mutual comedies for $10,000 each, added music by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples and sound effects, and re-released them through RKO Radio Pictures. Chaplin had no legal recourse to stop the RKO release.
