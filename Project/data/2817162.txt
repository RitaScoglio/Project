 musical romantic Holiday Inn. White Christmas", introduced by Crosby in the earlier film. 

Produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures, the film is notable for being the first to be released in VistaVision, a widescreen process developed by Paramount that entailed using twice the surface area of standard 35mm film; this large-area negative was used to yield finer-grained standard-sized 35mm prints.

==Plot== Broadway entertainer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger), is being relieved of command. 

When the train arrives in Pine Tree, theres not a snowflake in sight, and chances of it falling appear dim. He decides to prove to the General that he isnt forgotten.

Bob calls Ed Harrison (Johnny Grant), an old army buddy, now a successful variety show host, to arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. 

Mistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be portrayed as a pitiable figure in a nationwide broadcast, Emma reveals what she heard to a shocked Betty. The misunderstanding causes Betty to grow suddenly cold toward a baffled Bob. Meanwhile, Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer.

Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony, and Bob, still unaware of the real reason behind Bettys coldness, follows Betty to New York. Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he will not see the broadcast of Bobs announcement.

Bob and Betty declare their love for one another, as do Phil and Judy.

 title song, Oscar for Count Your Oscar nomination in the same category.

The song "Snow" was originally written for Call Me Madam with the title "Free," but was dropped in out-of-town tryouts. The melody and some of the words were kept, but the lyrics were changed to be more appropriate for a Christmas movie. For example, one of the lines of the original song is:

  Free &ndash; the only thing worth fighting for is to be free.
Free &ndash; a different world youd see if it were left to me.  
 
A composers demo of the original song can be found on the CD Irving Sings Berlin.

The song "What Can You Do with a General?" was originally written for an un-produced project called Stars on My Shoulders.

Trudy Stevens provided the singing voice for Vera-Ellen, except for "Sisters", where Rosemary Clooney sang both parts.  When the time came to record the soundtrack album, Clooneys contract with Columbia Records made it impossible for her to participate, therefore Peggy Lee stepped in. A soundtrack album with Crosby, Kaye, Clooney, and Stevens was not released until the recent CD anniversary reissue, in which the songs were taken directly from the film.

There are brief renditions of other Berlin songs ("Heat Wave", "Let Me Sing and Im Happy" and "Blue Skies").

Berlin wrote "A Crooner &ndash; A Comic" for Crosby and his planned co-star Donald OConnor, but when OConnor left the project so did the song. Crosby and Kaye also recorded another Berlin song ("Santa Claus") for the opening WWII Christmas Eve show scene, but it was not used in the final film; their recording of the song survives, however. 

==Production==
===Casting=== 
White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby and  .   on TCM.com   Near the end of January 1953, Crosby returned to the project, and Donald OConnor was signed to replace Astaire.  Just before shooting was to begin, OConnor had to drop out due to illness and was replaced by Danny Kaye, who asked for and received a salary of $200,000 and 10% of the gross.  Financially, the film was a partnership between Crosby and Irving Berlin, who shared half the profits, and Paramount, which got the other half. 

Within the film, a number of soon-to-be famous performers appear. Dancer Barrie Chase appears un-billed, as the character Doris Lenz ("Mutual, Im sure!"). Future Academy Award winner George Chakiris also appears  as one of the stone-faced black-clad dancers surrounding Rosemary Clooney in "Love, You Didnt Do Right by Me". John Brascia leads the dance troupe and appears opposite Vera-Ellen throughout much of the movie, particularly in the "Mandy" and "Choreography" numbers.  The photo Vera-Ellen shows of her brother Benny (the one Phil refers to as "Freckle-faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy") is actually a photo of Carl Switzer, who played Alfalfa in The Little Rascals, in an army field jacket and helmet liner.

A scene from the film featuring Crosby and Kaye was broadcast the year after the films release, on Christmas Day 1955, in the final episode of the NBC TV show Colgate Comedy Hour (1950â€“1955).

===Filming===
Principal photography took place between September and November 1953. The film was the first to be shot using Paramounts new VistaVision process, with color by Technicolor, and also introduced the Perspecta directional sound system which used three inaudible tones in order to pan the monaural sound into either left, center or right.

===Sound=== Easter Parade but unlike many other musicals of the 1950s which have been able to be remixed to stereo or 5.1, it is impossible to do this for White Christmas, due to the fact that although the picture was released in an extremely limited fashion with a full three-channel stereo mix carried on 4-track mag release prints, no complete true stereo print has ever been able to be assembled from all known elements.

All the original separate recording angles for both the pre-records and post-records for the picture were destroyed in a fire, and all that remains is a magnetic high-fidelity monaural music master, prepared for international release, and a low-fidelity optical mono composite master which includes all dialogue, sound effects and other elements. These were restored and combined for the Criterion Collection LaserDisc release; however, on the newer releases the monaural composite occupies the front center and the magnetic music-only track is fattened up a bit and placed in the surrounds by itself.

====Sound track====
It was not possible to issue an "original soundtrack album" of the film, because  , while Columbia issued Irving Berlins White Christmas. On the former, the song "Sisters" (as well as all of Clooneys vocal parts) was recorded by Peggy Lee, while on the latter, the song was sung by Rosemary Clooney and her own sister, Betty Clooney|Betty.
