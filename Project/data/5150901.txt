==Plot==
The Prestons are an apparently happy London household, made up of wife Amy (Yvonne Mitchell), husband Jim (Anthony Quayle) and teenage son Brian (Andrew Ray). Although the family appears happy, there is considerable tension, as Amy never gets organised enough to get dressed each day.  Instead, she does the housework, cooks the meals, etc., in her dressing gown.  Jim is having an affair with a co-worker, Georgie (Sylvia Syms), who threatens to break it off unless Jim divorces his wife and leaves his family. He promises that he will do so, and demands a divorce from Amy. Amy is shocked and distraught, while Brian becomes angry with his father. 

Amy invites Jim and Georgie back to the Prestons flat, to try to convince Georgie not to take her husband away. Amy gets her hair done and tries to organise a meal, paying for it all by pawning her engagement ring. However, she gets drunk and falls asleep on the bed, later ordering Jim and Georgie out of the flat. Jim leaves, but has second thoughts, returning to his wife and son, who cautiously accept him back.
