}} Thomas Mitchell.

==Plot== Thomas Mitchell) at his garage, after mentioning that he is the son of a famous driver called "Cannonball" Coy. Billys father died in an accident at the Indianapolis 500 a few years ago.

Red used to be a mechanic working for Cannonball, and still has the hots for his widow, Billys mother, Mary (Spring Byington).

At the garage, Billy befriends a tomboy named Louise Riley (Mary Hatcher), whose father owns the nearest racetrack. Soon Billy gets a chance to prove his skills as a driver in a qualifying race, but he is too arrogant to follow his employers advice and is unsuccessful. He goes on to ask Louise to meet on Saturday night at the racetrack, and thinking it is a date, Louise makes an effort, putting on a dress and pumps. It turns out Billy needed her help with changing some carburetors, and Louise has to swallow and hide her disappointment.
 Michael OShea). Billy survives the crash, and after another man driving for Deacon Jones injures his hand, Billy is offered to drive instead.
 Steve Brodie). But Billy manages to get arrested for speeding after a night out at a club, when he has too much to drink. Red comes to the rescue and bails him out, and contrary to Reds advice goes on to race that same night.

When the left rear wheel in Happys car breaks during the race, Billy crashes into his car and Happy dies in the flames. After the race, the other drivers avoid Billy, and he is fired from Deacon Jones garage. He decides to move from California.

Billy stays in contact with Louise, and promises to meet her again on the next Memorial Day, at the Indianapolis. He travels east and starts over as a race car driver. During the time he is gone, his mother and Red become a couple and get married.

On the day of the next Indianapolis, Mary, Red and Louise are all at the race track and about to watch Billys return as he drives one of Reds cars. He drives well, but when he has only one lap left, the engine catches fire. He still finishes the race, ending up in third place, and manages to save himself by leaving the car just before it explodes in a sea of flames.

The winner gives the trophy to Billy for his bravery, and he reunites with Louise.
