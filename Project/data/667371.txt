 his broomstick, godfather and Peter Pettigrew.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Hagrid to console him over Buckbeaks impending execution. Afterwards, Rons pet rat Scabbers escapes, and when Ron gives chase, a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the Whomping Willows base, which is actually an underground passage to the Shrieking Shack. The trio discovers that the dog is actually Sirius, who is an Animagus. Lupin arrives and embraces Sirius as an old friend, then admits to being a werewolf, and explains that Sirius is innocent. Much to Rons surprise, Scabbers is actually Pettigrew, an Animagus who committed the crime for which Sirius was convicted. After forcing him back into a human, Lupin and Sirius prepare to kill Pettigrew, but Harry intervenes and convinces them to turn Pettigrew over to the Dementors.
 his dead father, and passes out, awakening to discover that Sirius has been captured and sentenced to the Dementors Kiss. Acting on Dumbledores advice, Harry and Hermione travel back in time, watching themselves repeat the nights events. They save Buckbeak from execution and witness the Dementors overpower Sirius and Harry. The present Harry realises that he himself was the one to cast the Patronus, not his father, and does so.

Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt broom, the fastest broom in the world, and Harry happily takes it for a ride.

==Cast==
  Harry Potter
* Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, one of Harrys best friends.
* Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Harrys other best friend.

* Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper and the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher.
* Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore, the Hogwarts Headmaster. Gambon assumed the role after Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in the previous two films, died on 25 October 2002.  Despite his illness, Harris was determined to film his part, telling a visiting David Heyman not to recast the role.    Four months after Harriss death, Cuarón chose Gambon as his replacement.     Gambon was unconcerned with bettering or copying Harris, instead giving his own interpretation, putting on a slight Irish accent for the role,    as well as completing his scenes in three weeks.  Rumours of Ian McKellen being offered the role started to spread, but when confronted, he turned the rumours down, stating that he has played a similar character in Gandalf of The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He also stated it would have been inappropriate to take Harris role, as the late actor had called McKellen a "dreadful" actor.   Harriss family had expressed an interest in seeing Harriss close friend Peter OToole being chosen as his replacement. 
* Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Harrys Muggle uncle.
* Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, an escapee from the Wizarding prison Azkaban and Harrys godfather. Oldman accepted the part because he needed the money, as he had not taken on any major work in several years, having decided to spend more time with his children.    He drew inspiration from Cuarón, whom he described as having "such enthusiasm and a joy for life,"    and compared Sirius to John Lennon.  He was "surprised by how difficult it was to pull off", comparing the role to Shakespearean dialogue.  Oldman suggested Siriuss hairstyle, while Cuarón designed his tattoos.  He had read the first book, and his children were fans of the series. The part made Oldman a hero with his children and their schoolmates. 
* Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, the Potions master at Hogwarts.
* Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Harrys Muggle aunt. Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts. Peter Pettigrew, a friend of Harrys parents said to have been killed by Sirius Black. turned out to be incorrect.  Thewlis had seen the first two films and had only read part of the first book, although after taking the role he read the third. He was excited about the prospect of making a childrens film, and thoroughly enjoyed filming.  Divination teacher at Hogwarts.
* Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, the Weasley matriarch and a mother figure to Harry.
 

==Production==

===Development=== Chris Columbus, A Little Princess.    Heyman found that "tonally and stylistically,   was the perfect fit."  As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the characters emotional experience. Of Rupert Grints essay, Cuarón recalls, "Rupert didnt deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didnt do it, he said, Im Ron; Ron wouldnt do it. So I said, Okay, you do understand your character. That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on Prisoner of Azkaban, because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process."  

===Filming===

 train bridge, Chamber of Secrets, is opposite Loch Shiel and was used to film the sequences when the Dementor boarded the train. A small section of the triple-decker bus scene, where it weaves in between traffic, was filmed in North Londons Palmers Green. Some parts were also filmed in and around Borough Market and Lambeth Bridge in London.
 the first film.
 sixth book.  Rowling said she "got goose bumps|goosebumps" when she saw several moments in the film, as they inadvertently referred to events in the final two books, she stated "people are going to look back on the film and think that those were put in deliberately as clues."  When filming concluded, Cuarón found that it had "been the two sweetest years of my life," and expressed his interest in directing one of the sequels. 

===Effects===
Cuarón originally wanted to move away from CGI toward puppetry. He hired master underwater puppeteer Basil Twist to help, using puppets to study the potential movement of the Dementors.  Once it became apparent that puppetry would be too expensive and unable to portray the specific elements of the Dementors, Cuarón turned to CGI; however, he and his team did use footage of Dementor puppets underwater as a basis for the flowing movements of the computer-generated Dementors.
 The Leaky magic quality of the Harry Potter world by having the Muggle world go into bullet time while inside the Knight Bus, Harry, Stan Shunpike and Ernie Prang (and the talking shrunken head) keep moving in real time.

===Music===
 
 
 score was the third and final score in the series to be composed and conducted by John Williams. It was released on CD on 25 May 2004. In general, this films music is not as bright as that of the previous films, with distinct medieval influences in the instrumentation. One of the new themes, "Double Trouble," was written during production so that a childrens choir could perform it in Hogwartss Great Hall in one of the films earlier scenes. The lyrics of "Double Trouble" are from a ritual performed by the Weïrd Sisters in Act 4, Scene 1 of Shakespeares Macbeth.  The films trailer prominently features the cues "Anticipation" and "Progeny" by Brand X Music, a trailer music band.

==Differences from the book==
 
Prisoner of Azkaban was, at the time of publication, the series longest book. The increasing plot complexity necessitated a looser adaptation of the books finer plot lines and back-story. The film opens with Harry using magic to light his wand in short bursts, whereas in the same scene in the book, he uses a flashlight, as performing magic outside the wizard world is illegal for wizards under the age of seventeen. Also in the book, there is no shrunken head in the Knight Bus, while in the film, a rude shrunken head talks through most of the Knight Bus scene. The connection between Harrys parents and the Marauders Map is only briefly mentioned,    as is  s back story is also cut, with no mention of the manner of his escape from Azkaban. 
 potions classes, were cut from the film.  The Fidelius Charms complicated description is removed entirely from the film, with no explanation given of exactly how Black "betrayed" the Potters to Lord Voldemort. Many of this scenes lines are redistributed amongst Cornelius Fudge and Minerva McGonagall; in compensation, McGonagalls exposition of the Animagus transformation is instead given by Snape. 

In the film, where Harry and Hermione have travelled back in time and are hiding outside of Hagrids hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that they are there, as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeaks execution order as well, then after Fudge agrees he says it will take some time as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, right before he is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak.

The embryonic romantic connection between Ron and Hermione is more prominent in the film than the book; in response to criticism of the first two films for sacrificing character development for mystery and adventure, the emotional development of all three lead characters is given more attention in the third film.  However, some critics and fans thought that the result was a murky plotline. That said, any mention of the beginnings of Harrys crush on Cho Chang is removed.  Harrys darker side is first glimpsed in this film, when Harry proclaims, "I hope he   finds me. Because when he does, Im going to be ready. When he does, Im going to kill him!" 
Also, Harry receives the Firebolt at the films end, while in the book he receives it anonymously at Christmas and it is confiscated for a few weeks to be checked for possible jinxes by Professor Flitwick and Madam Hooch. Lastly, in relation to the change in the arrival of the Firebolt, one of the two Quidditch matches featured in the book (between Gryffindor and Slytherin) is not featured in the movie, as it is meant to take place several weeks after the delivery of the Firebolt.

==Distribution==

===Marketing=== video game version, designed by EA UK, was released 25 May 2004 in North America and 29 May 2004 in Europe. Mattel released film tie-ins that included the Harry Potter Championship Quidditch board game and character action figures.  Lego also expanded on its previous merchandising for the first two films with the release of sets ranging from the Knight Bus to the Shrieking Shack.
