The 13th Warrior is a 1999 American historical fiction action film based on the novel Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton  and is a loose retelling of the tale of Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf. It stars Antonio Banderas as Ahmad ibn Fadlan, Diane Venora and Omar Sharif. It was directed by John McTiernan. Crichton directed some reshoots uncredited. The film was produced by McTiernan, Crichton, and Ned Dowd, with Andrew G. Vajna and Ethan Dubrow as executive producers.

The film was a financial failure. Production and marketing costs reputedly reached $160 million, but it only grossed $61 million at the box office worldwide.

==Plot== Turkic raiders by the appearance of Norsemen. Taking refuge at their settlement on the Volga river, communications are established through Melchisidek and Herger, a Norseman who speaks Latin. Ahmad and Melchisidek are in time to witness a fight, which establishes Buliwyf as heir apparent, followed by the Viking funeral of their dead king, cremated together with a young woman who agreed to accompany him to Valhalla.

A youth enters the camp requesting Buliwyfs aid: his fathers kingdom in the far north is under attack from an ancient evil so frightening that even the bravest warriors dare not name it. The "angel of death", a völva (wisewoman), determines the mission will be successful if thirteen warriors go to face this danger—but the thirteenth must not be a Norseman. Ahmad is recruited against his will.

Ahmad learns Norse during their journey by listening intently to his companions conversations. He is looked down upon by the huge Norsemen, who mock his physical weakness and his small Arabian horse, but he earns a measure of respect by his fast learning of their language, his horsemanship, ingenuity, and ability to write.
 venus figurine. In a string of clashes, Buliwyfs band establishes that the Wendol are humanoid cannibals who appear as, live like, and identify with bears.

Their numbers dwindling and their position all but indefensible, an ancient völva of the village tells them to track the Wendol to their lair and destroy their leaders, the "Mother of the Wendol" and the war leader who wears "the horns of power". Buliwyf and the remaining warriors infiltrate the Wendol cave-complex and kill the Mother, but not before Buliwyf is scratched deeply across the shoulder by her poisoned "fingernail claw".

The remaining warriors return to the village and prepare for a final battle they do not expect to survive. Buliwyf succeeds in killing the Wendol war leader, causing their defeat, before succumbing to the poison. Ahmad ibn Fadlan witnesses Buliwyfs royal funeral before returning to his homeland, grateful to the Norsemen for helping him to "become a man, and a useful servant of God".

==Production==
Originally titled Eaters of the Dead, production began in the summer of 1997, but the film went through several re-edits after test audiences did not react well to the initial cut. Crichton took over as director himself due to the poor test audience reception, causing the release date to be pushed back over a year. The film was re-cut, a new ending added, along with a new score. Graeme Revell was replaced by Jerry Goldsmith as composer. The title was changed to The 13th Warrior. 

===Budget and box office===
The budget, which was originally around $85 million, reportedly soared to $100 million before principal photography wrapped. With all of the re-shoots and promotional expenses, the total cost of the film was rumored to be as high as $160 million, which given its lackluster box office take (earning only US $61.7 million worldwide), made for a loss of $70–130 million.   

The film debuted at No. 2 on its opening weekend behind The Sixth Sense. 

===Reception===
The 13th Warrior currently holds a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes which sums it up as "Atmospheric, great sets and costumes, but thin plot." 

Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of four, remarking that it "lumber  from one expensive set-piece to the next without taking the time to tell a story that might make us care."  Conversely, James Berardinelli gave The 13th Warrior three stars out of four, calling it "a solid offering" that "delivers an exhilarating 100 minutes". 

In his book Reel Bad Arabs, media studies professor Jack Shaheen listed The 13th Warrior on his "Best" list of films with balanced and sometimes heroic portrayals of Arabs. 

The outcome of the films production disappointed Omar Sharif so much that he temporarily retired from film acting, not taking a role in another major film until 2003s Monsieur Ibrahim.:
:"After my small role in The 13th Warrior, I said to myself, Let us stop this nonsense, these meal tickets that we do because it pays well. I thought, Unless I find a stupendous film that I love and that makes me want to leave home to do, I will stop. Bad pictures are very humiliating, I was really sick. It is terrifying to have to do the dialogue from bad scripts, to face a director who does not know what he is doing, in a film so bad that it is not even worth exploring."
