Boys Love, the first film released in 2006, tells the story of Taishin Mamiya, a magazine editor who meets and interviews a young Model (person)|model, Noeru Kisaragi, and becomes attracted to him. Their love, however, is forbidden. The tagline of the movie is "All we did was love each other, but...our love is forbidden. Why is it a sin"?

=== Plot ===

Just doing his job, magazine editor Taishin Mamiya (Yoshikazu Kotani) interviews high school model Noeru Kisaragi (Takumi Saito). Despite Noerus bad attitude, an enchanting picture of the ocean he draws leads Mamiya to invite him out for dinner after-wards. They connect at the restaurant, but while in the bathroom there Noeru solicits Mamiya sexually. The next morning, Noerus office calls the magazine office where Mamiya works. "Your editor was rude. Have him come and apologize." When Mamiya goes to Noerus house to deliver the apology, he sees Noeru with a dirty-looking man. Mamiya is shocked to discover at that moment that his interest in Noeru goes beyond article research—he truly wants to know more about him.
