Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity.

As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan, thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her and is always looking at herself in the mirror, hysterically cuts off chunks of Christinas hair to humiliate her.

Afterwards, Joan wrecks the bathroom as well. Believing the perfectly clean floor is still dirty, Joan throws cleaning powder all over the bathroom before striking Christina across the back with the can of cleanser and then screams at her to clean it up. Christopher offers to help but Christina tells him to return to his own bed as she fears Joan will kill her if she finds out.

Later, Joan sends Christina to the Chadwick School. Years later, when a teenage Christina (Diana Scarwid) is caught in a compromising position with a boy, Joan brings her home. Barbara Bennett (Jocelyn Brando), a reporter from Redbook magazine, is writing a puff piece on Joans home life. After Joan lies about Christina being expelled from Chadwick, Christina confronts her in front of the reporter. In the ensuing argument, Joan slaps Christina twice across the face. Christina questions her mother as to why she was adopted, and Joan confesses that it was partially a publicity stunt, but then says that she did not really mean it. After Christina yells, "I am not one of your fans!" Joan throws her to the floor, then throttles Christina, who pleads with her to stop. Joans live-in assistant and the reporter pull her away.

===Critical reception===
Mommie Dearest received mixed reviews from critics. As of July 2014, the film held 55% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 film critics. The sites consensus states: "Director Frank Perrys campy melodrama certainly doesnt lack for conviction, and neither does Faye Dunaways performance in the title role; unfortunately, it does lack enough narrative discipline to offer much more than a guilty pleasure." 

Roger Ebert opened his review with "I cant imagine who would want to subject themselves to this movie."  About Dunaways performance, Variety (magazine)|Variety said "Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, costars and all." 
However, more positive reviews have been published, with Slant Magazine awarding it four stars in the May 31, 2006 edition.   Also Dennis Price wrote "Faye Dunaway portrays Joan Crawford in a likeness so chilling its almost unnatural" in his review of the film. 

===Advertising=== Paramount realized camp status, proclaiming, "Meet the biggest MOTHER of them all!" 

===Cast response===
In her autobiography, Dunaway only makes a brief mention of the film stating that she wished that director Perry had had enough experience to see when actors needed to rein in their performances.  By coincidence, Joan Crawford once said in an interview in the early 1970s that of the current young actresses only Faye Dunaway had "what it takes" to be a true star.
