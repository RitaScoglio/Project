}} action thriller Walter Hill and starring Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken and Bruce Dern. It is a credited remake of Akira Kurosawas Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo, and was influenced heavily by the plot of A Fistful of Dollars, which is nearly the same.

== Plot ==
In 1932,  . Mere moments after arriving in the city, he takes a look at a young woman named Felina (Karina Lombard), and because of that, he is surrounded by Irish mobsters led by Finn, who is working under Doyle (David Patrick Kelly), who promptly smashes his car and leave it in a state of disarray, telling him that nobody cannot even look at the girl since she is "Doyles property". Smith doesnt react, but instead, he checks into a small bar/hotel led by Joe Monday (William Sanderson).
 Colt M1911s, and blasts Doyles office, and leaves the place, returning to the bar, much to the surprise of Jerichos residents. He later goes to a local mechanic and pays him to fix his car.

Finns murder catches the attention of Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), and Smith is greeted by two of Strozzis henchmen, who offer him a job. Smith accepts and relocates to Strozzis bar outside of Jericho, where he is introduced to him and his right-hand man, Giorgio Carmonte (Michael Imperioli), son of a prominent Chicago mobster who is monitoring Strozzis activities in Jericho, who distrusts Smith. Strozzi predicts a gang war between them and Doyles gang. Smith, who overhears some important information, goes to Galt and tells him the information, knowing he will pass them to Doyle. He also seduces Strozzis mistress, Lucy (Alexandra Powers), and has sex with her.

Strozzi manages to bribe Ramirez, a corrupt Mexican police capitán who is working for Doyle. Ramirez is escorting a convoy of Doyles trucks from Mexico to Texas, but, since he was bribed by Strozzi, he is led to an ambush spot where Strozzi, Carmonte and Smith, along with Strozzis crew, are waiting from then. The Mexican police kill Doyles men and turn the trucks over to Strozzi, who capture the stolen alcohol and the trucks, destroying a major part of Doyles shipments and disrupting his operation in Texas. Afterwards, Carmonte goes to Mexico with Ramirez to cut more deals.

Meanwhile, Doyle and his right-hand man, Hickey (Christopher Walken) return to Jericho, being absent while Smith arrived, and hear about the recent events. Smith defects to Doyles gang and passes out valuable information, effectively becoming a triple agent. Smith informs on the ambush and reveals that Ramirez was bribed by Strozzi. Hickey goes back to Mexico with Doyles men and ambushes Ramirez and Carmonte, who are also with a corrupt United States Border Patrol|U.S Border Patrol officer, killing the officer and Ramirez and kidnapping Giorgio. Afterwards, Doyle demands a large amount of money and the trucks back in exchange for Giorgio. However, Strozzi kidnaps Felina while she is in the church, forcing a stalemate between him and Doyle, and the two agree to exchange Giorgio in exchange for Felina. Smith, who is standing by Doyles side, witnesses the event, and the two gangs scatter after the exchange.
 Texas Rangers, who is upset over the death of the Border Patrol officer. He warns Smith that he can tolerate one gang in Jericho, but not two. He explains to Smith that he will bring a squad of 20 Rangers into Jericho in 10 days, and if he finds both gangs, he will wipe them out both. Smith informs him that he will wipe out the gangs by himself since he is looking for some easy money, and Pickett informs him that if Smith is here when he returns back, he will eliminate him as well.

Lucy comes to Smith and reveals that Strozzi, angered after the exchange, beat her and had Giorgio cut her ear off when she revealed her affair with Smith. Smith gives her some money and puts her on a bus out of Jericho. The next day Smith relays a false rumor that Strozzi is bringing in more soldiers. Playing on Doyles obsession with Felina, he makes Doyle afraid that Strozzi will try to kidnap her again, and Doyle orders Smith to go to the safehouse where Felina is being held. Smith kills the men guarding Felina. Felina reveals that her husband lost to Doyle on a game of poker and he kept her as a prize, and she goes to Mexico to return to her family, with Smith giving her one of Doyles cars and some money. The next day, Smith is waiting at the safehouse when Doyle arrives, and claims that he arrived too late, Strozzis men had already killed the guards and abducted Felina. Doyles henchman Jack McCool (R. D. Call) believes Smiths story, while Hickey suspects that Smith killed the guards and freed Felina. Doyle goes berserk and declares all-out war on Strozzi and his gang.

Smiths plan goes awry when Hickey and some of Doyles men ambush Smith, with Hickey revealing that he had pieced together the truth by learning that Felina was not abducted by Strozzi and had sold her car in Mexico and took a bus to the South. Doyle imprisons Smith and has him tortured, demanding to know where Felina is. Despite the heavy torture inflicted on him, Smith refuses to talk. Later that night, he escapes by killing two of Doyles men, and escapes town with the aid of Monday and Sheriff Galt. As they are driving out of town, they see Doyles gang slaughtering Strozzis gang at a roadhouse. After all of their men are killed by Doyles men, Strozzi and Giorgio exit the roadhouse and try to surrender to a revenge-driven Doyle. Hickey shoots Strozzi to death, while Giorgio is killed by Doyles men.

Smith takes refuge at a remote church where Felina went to pray. Two days later, Sheriff Galt arrives and informs Smith that Joe was caught smuggling food and water to Smith and that Doyle will probably torture him to death. He then hands Smith his twin M1911s and informs him that that is all the help Smith can expect from him. Smith returns to town and storms Strozzis hotel, which is now Doyles headquarters and kills all of Doyles men, including McCool, and rescues Joe. Doyle and Hickey are absent, having gone down to Mexico in a desperate search for Felina.
 1928 Thompson and says he doesnt want to die in Texas ("Chicago maybe") and starts to walk away, intending to actually kill Smith. With lightning speed he turns and quickdraws a pistol from his holster, but Smith is faster and shoots Hickey, killing him.

Smith gets into his Ford (which was repaired by the mechanic) and drives on to Mexico, his original destination, leaving Joe some money and Doyles car to return back to Jericho. He reflects that he is as broke as he was when he first arrived, having given all the money he made off the two gangs to various women in order to get them out of town, including Felina and Lucy. However, he consoles himself that everyone in the two gangs is better off dead.

Walter Hill later said that he and Bruce Willis "were not close when we did the film" but "I liked working with him. It was impersonal. Classic, I know what you mean. You want me to be a Bogart, Mitchum kind of guy and I said Exactly. Let it happen. He then took that and gave what I thought was a very good performance. I always sensed there was a kind of core resentment that Bruce felt he should be more appreciated for his talents. At the same time I think there is a limitation, that he does certain things better than others, and he hasnt always chosen so wisely."   accessed 12 June 2014 

Walter Hills original cut of the movie was over two hours long. Before Hill edited the final theatrical version his rough cut was used to edit the trailers for the movie, which is why there is lot of alternate/deleted footage shown in them, including many alternate takes, different edits of some scenes, extended versions of scenes, some extra lines of dialogue, shots and parts of deleted scenes including additional shootout sequence between two gangs and alternate ending in which Hickey is killed by Smith in different way. Some promotional stills and pictures also show several deleted scenes.
== Reception ==
The film was a box office bomb, grossing only a total $18,127,448 domestically by December 22, 1996, and brought in only $47,267,001 worldwide. 

The film received mixed to negative critical reviews, with a rotten 37% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Common recurring complaints address the oppressive and depressing atmosphere of the film; the flat, almost monotonous personality of Willis character between gunfights; and the films Pyrrhic victory finale. Critic Roger Ebert (who gave the film one star) wrote:
 
Last Man Standing is such a desperately cheerless film, so dry and laconic and wrung out, that you wonder if the filmmakers ever thought that in any way it could be ... fun. It contains elements that are often found in entertainments — things like guns, gangs and spectacular displays of death — but here they crouch on the screen and growl at the audience. Even the movies hero is bad company. ... The victory at the end is downbeat, and there is an indifference to it. This is such a sad, lonely movie.  
Despite its reception, the film did have positive reviews. Those, however, were mostly about Walkens portrayal of Hickey.
