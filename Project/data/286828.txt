Lady and the Tramp is a 1955 American animated  , was released in 2001.    

==Plot==
 
On Christmas morning 1909, Jim Dear gives his wife Darling an American cocker spaniel puppy which she names Lady. Lady enjoys a happy life with the couple and two local neighborhood dogs, Jock, a Scottish terrier, and Trusty, a bloodhound. Meanwhile, across town, a stray mutt named Tramp lives on his own, dining on scraps from Tonys restaurant and protecting his friends from the local Animal control officer|dogcatcher. One day, Lady is saddened after her owners begin treating her rather coldly. Jock and Trusty visit her and determine that their change in behavior is due to Darling expecting a baby. While Jock and Trusty try to explain what a baby is, Tramp interrupts the conversation and offers his own thoughts on the matter, making Jock and Trusty take an immediate dislike to the stray and order him out of the yard. As Tramp leaves, he reminds Lady that "when the baby moves in, the dog moves out."

Eventually, the baby arrives and the couple introduces Lady to the infant, whom Lady grows fond of. Soon after, Jim Dear and Darling leave for a trip, with their Aunt Sarah looking after the baby and the house. Aunt Sarahs two trouble-making Siamese cats, Si and Am, trick her into thinking that Lady attacked them with the house a mess. Aunt Sarah takes Lady to a pet shop to get a muzzle. Lady flees in horror, only to be pursued by a pack of stray dogs. Tramp rescues her and finds a beaver at the local zoo who can remove the muzzle. Later, Tramp shows Lady how he lives "footloose and collar-free", eventually leading into a candlelit Italian dinner at Tonys. Lady begins to fall in love with Tramp, but she chooses to return home in order to watch over the baby. Tramp offers to escort Lady back home, but when Tramp decides to chase hens around a farmyard for fun, Lady is captured by the dog catcher and taken to the local dog pound. While there, Lady learns that Tramp has dated other dogs. She is eventually claimed by Aunt Sarah, who chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away.

Jock and Trusty visit to comfort Lady, but when Tramp arrives to apologize, Lady angrily confronts him about his past girlfriends. After Tramp leaves, Lady sees a rat trying to sneak into the house. She barks frantically, but Aunt Sarah tells her to be quiet. Tramp hears her barking and rushes back; he enters the house and corners the rat in the nursery. Lady breaks free and rushes to the nursery, where Tramp inadvertently knocks over the babys crib before ultimately killing the rat. The commotion alerts Aunt Sarah, who sees both dogs and assumes that they are responsible. She pushes Tramp in a closet and locks Lady in the basement, then calls the pound to take Tramp away. Jim Dear and Darling return home as the dog catcher departs, and when they release Lady, she leads them to the dead rat. Realizing Tramps true intentions, Jock and Trusty chase after the dog catchers wagon. The dogs are able to track down the wagon and scare the horses, causing the wagon to crash. Jim Dear arrives in a taxi with Lady, and she reunites with Tramp, but their joy is short-lived when they see Trusty under the wagon, motionless, with Jock howling mournfully.

===Story development===
In 1937 Disney story man Joe Grant came up with an idea inspired by the antics of his English Springer Spaniel Lady, and how she got "shoved aside" by Joes new baby. He approached Walt Disney with sketches of Lady. Disney enjoyed the sketches and commissioned Grant to start story development on a new animated feature Lady.    Through the late 1930s and early 1940s, Joe Grant and other artists worked on the story, taking a variety of approaches, but Disney wasnt pleased with any of them, primarily because he thought Lady was too sweet, and there wasnt enough action. 

In the early 1940s, Walt read the short story written by Ward Greene, "Happy Dan, The Whistling Dog", in Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan magazine.  He thought Grants story would be improved if Lady fell in love with a cynical dog character like the one in Greenes story and bought the rights to it.    The cynical dog had various names during development, including Homer, Rags, and Bozo, before "Tramp" was chosen. It was first thought "Tramp" wouldnt be acceptable because of the sexual connotation associated with the word ("The Lady is a Tramp"), but Walt Disney approved it was considered safe.     

The finished film is slightly different from what was originally planned. Lady was to have only one next-door neighbor, a Ralph Bellamy-type canine named Hubert. Hubert was later replaced by Jock and Trusty. The villainous Aunt Sarah was the traditional overbearing mother-in-law. In the final film, shes softened to a busybody who is well-meaning and the films main antagonist. Aunt Sarahs Nip and Tuck were later renamed Si and Am.  Originally, Ladys owners were called Jim Brown and Elizabeth. These were changed to highlight Ladys point of view. They were briefly referred to as "Mister" and "Missis" before settling on the names "Jim Dear" and "Darling". To maintain a dogs perspective (visual)|perspective, Darling and Jims faces are rarely shown, similar to Mammy Two Shoes in the Tom and Jerry cartoons. The rat was a somewhat comic character in early sketches, but became a great deal more frightening, due to the need to raise dramatic tension. A scene created but then deleted was one in which after Trusty says "Everybody knows, a dogs best friend is his human". This leads to Tramp describing a world where the roles of both dogs and humans are switched; the dogs are the masters and vice versa.  There was a love triangle among Lady, Tramp, and a Russian wolfhound named Boris (who appears in the dog pound in the final version).  By June 1943, a treatment had been completed, but the artists were not allowed to go any further, as the studio was producing mostly instructional and propaganda films for World War II. Story development continued after the war.

In 1947, the Spanish writer María Lejárraga arrived in the US and sent a couple of screenplays to Disney, one of them with the title Merlín y Viviana o la gata egoísta y el perro atontado which the company returned to María. Afterwards, she was surprised to find numerous similarities with her original text and Lady and the Tramp, simply changing Viviana, the cat, to a dog, Lady. 
 Eric Goldberg hoped to rectify in the Lady and the Tramp Platinum Editions behind-the-scenes vignette that explained Grants role. 

===Animation=== Frank Thomas was against Walts decision and animated the entire scene himself without any lay-outs. Walt was impressed by Thomass work and how he romanticised the scene and kept the scene in.  On viewing the first take of the scene, the animators felt that the action should be slowed down, so an apprentice trainee was assigned to create "half numbers" in between many of the original frames. 
 Sleeping Beauty) did almost 50 miniature concept sketches for the Bella Notte sequence and was a key contributor to the film. 

====CinemaScope====
  aspect ratio. However, due to the growing interest of widescreen film amongst movie-goers, Disney decided to animate the film in CinemaScope making Lady and the Tramp the first animated feature made in the process.  This new innovation presented additional problems for the animators: the expansion of space created more realism but gave fewer closeups.  It also made it difficult for a single character to dominate the screen so that groups had to be spread out to keep the screen from appearing sparse.  Longer takes become necessary since constant jump-cutting would seem too busy or annoying.  Layout artists essentially had to reinvent their technique. Animators had to remember that they had to move their characters across a background instead of the background passing behind them.  Yet the animators overcame these obstacles during the action scenes, such as Tramp killing the rat. 

More problems arose as the premiere date got closer, since not all theaters had the capability to show CinemaScope at the time. Upon learning this, Walt issued two versions of the film: one in widescreen, and another in the Academy ratio. This involved gathering the layout artists to restructure key scenes when characters were on the edges of the screen. 

==Release== Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,  earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955.  An episode of Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland called "A Story of Dogs" aired before the films release.  The film was also reissued to theaters in 1962, 1971, 1980, and 1986.

Lady and the Tramp has become quite iconic in the history of cinema. The sequence of Lady and Tramp sharing a plate of Italian spaghetti&nbsp;– climaxed by an accidental kiss as they swallow opposite ends of the same piece of spaghetti&nbsp;– is considered an iconic scene in  American film history.

Yet, despite being an enormous success at the box office, the film was also initially panned by critics: one indicated that the dogs had "the dimensions of hippos," another that "the artists work is below par".
