 Best 100 British films   In 2004, a poll by the magazine Total Film of 25 film critics named A Matter of Life and Death the second greatest British film ever made, behind Get Carter.  

==Plot== Lancaster bomber home after a mission over Germany on 2 May 1945. He has ordered his crew to bail out, without revealing that his own parachute has been shot up. He manages to contact June, a US radio operator based in Britain, and talks with her for a few minutes before jumping without a parachute.

Peter should have died at that point, but Conductor 71, the guide sent to escort him to the "Other World", misses him in the thick fog over the English Channel. The airman wakes up the next day on a beach near Junes base. At first, he assumes he is in the afterlife, but then, after a de Havilland Mosquito flies low overhead, discovers to his bewilderment that he is still alive.

Peter meets June, cycling back to her quarters after her night shift, and they fall in love. Conductor 71 (an aristocrat executed in the French Revolution) stops time to explain the situation to Peter and urge him to accept his death and accompany him to the Other World, but Peter demands that the matter be appealed. While Conductor 71 consults his superiors, Peter continues to live his life. Conductor 71 returns and informs him that he has been granted his appeal and has three days to prepare his case. He may choose a defending counsel from among all the people who have died, but has great difficulty picking one.

Peters visions are diagnosed by Junes fascinated friend Doctor Reeves as a symptom of a brain injury&nbsp;– chronic adhesive arachnoiditis from a slight concussion two years earlier&nbsp;– and he is scheduled for surgery. Reeves is killed in a motorcycle accident while trying to find the ambulance that is to take Peter to the hospital, which allows him to act as Peters counsel.

Reeves argues that, through no fault of his own, his client was given additional time on Earth and during that time he has fallen in love and now has an earthly commitment that should take precedence over the afterlifes claim on him. The matter comes to a head&nbsp;– in parallel with Peters brain surgery – before a celestial court&nbsp;– the camera zooms out from an amphitheatre to reveal that it is as large as a spiral galaxy. The prosecutor is American Abraham Farlan, who hates the British for making him the first casualty of the American Revolutionary War. Reeves challenges the composition of the jury, which is made up of representatives who are prejudiced against the British. In fairness, the jury is replaced by a cosmopolitan mixture of modern Americans whose origins are as varied as those they replace.

Reeves and Farlan both cite examples from British and world history to support their positions. In the end, Reeves has June take the stand (she is made to fall asleep in the "real" world by Conductor 71 so she can testify) and proves that she genuinely loves Peter by telling her that the only way to save his life is to take his place. She steps onto the stairway to the Other World without hesitation and is carried away, leaving Peter behind. Then the stairway comes to an abrupt halt and June rushes back to Peters open arms. As Reeves triumphantly explains, "...&nbsp;nothing is stronger than the law in the universe, but on Earth, nothing is stronger than love."

The jury rules in Peters favour. The Judge shows Reeves and Farlan the new lifespan granted to the defendant; Reeves calls it "very generous", and Farlan jokingly complains, then agrees to it. The two then engage in supportive banter with one another, and against the stern Chief Recorder, who protests against the breech of law. The scene then shifts to the operating room, where the surgery is declared a success by the surgeon.

==Production== Denham Studios in Denham, Buckinghamshire, England, and on locations in Devon and Surrey. The beach scene was shot at Saunton Sands in Devon, and the village seen in the camera obscura was Shere in Surrey. Production took place from 2 September to 2 December 1945, used twenty-nine sets, and cost an estimated £320,000. 

The film had an extensive pre-production period due to the complexity of the production:

The huge escalator linking this world with the other, called "Operation Ethel" by the firm of engineers who constructed it under the aegis of the London Passenger Transport Board, took three months to make and cost £3,000 (£ }} in   pounds ). "Ethel" had 106 steps, each   wide, and was driven by a 12 h.p. engine. The full shot was completed by hanging miniatures. Warman, 1946  The noise of the machinery prevented recording the soundtrack live&nbsp;— all scenes with the escalator were dubbed in post-production.

There was a nine-month wait for film stock and Technicolor cameras because they were being used by the US Army to make training films. Powell, 1986 

The decision to film the scenes of the "other world" in black and white added to the complications. Where the "other world" is seen, it was filmed in Three-Strip Technicolor, but the colour was not fully developed, giving a pearly hue to the black and white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as "Colour and Dye-Monochrome Processed in Technicolor".  (Breaking the fourth wall, Conductor 71 remarks during an early transition, "One is starved for Technicolor up there.")

Other sequences also presented challenges, such as the stopped-action table-tennis game for which Hunter and Livesey were trained by champions   

==Release== Empire Theatre, in London.    The performance was in aid of the Cinematograph Trade Benevolent Fund and £30,000 (£ }} in   pounds ) was raised.  It then went into general release in the UK on 15 December 1946.  The film subsequently had its US release in New York on 25 December 1946 under the name Stairway to Heaven. 
 Cannes Film Festival.   

== Critical reception==
  Christmas shows... he wit and agility of the producers, who also wrote and directed the job, is given range through the picture in countless delightful ways: in the use, for instance, of Technicolor to photograph the earthly scenes and sepia in which to vision the hygienic regions of the Beyond (so that the heavenly messenger, descending, is prompted to remark, Ah, how one is starved for Technicolor up there!."  

==Analysis==
 
===Are the visions real?===
While the film never specifically states whether Peters visions are real, the actor playing the judge also plays the brain surgeon. As is shown in the paper, "A Matter of Fried Onions"  and subsequent work by Diane Broadbent Friedman, there was a large amount of medical research carried out to ensure that the symptoms shown agreed with a correct medical diagnosis of Peter Carters condition. However, despite being asked several times within the film, no accepted answer to how Peter could have survived the fall is given.

There are two scenes set within "the other world" in which Peter is not present (Trubshawes arrival and just before the start of the trial) which seem to imply the existence of the other world. A minor point regarding a borrowed book (which forms a third "other world" experience while Peter is still unconscious following his operation) also seems to hint at the possibility of its existence, however all of these could be explained simply by Peters mind filling in blanks during times he is unconscious.

===The other world===
The producers took pains never to refer to "the other world" as heaven, as they felt that was too restrictive and limiting. An introductory title screen – repeated as the Foreword to the 1946 novelisation by Eric Warman  – contains an explicit statement: "This is the story of two worlds, the one we know and another which exists only in the mind of a young airman whose life and imagination have been violently shaped by war", adding "Any resemblance to any other world known or unknown is purely coincidental". But it does not say if the other world portrayed is part of the world we know or part of Peters hallucinations.

Powell and Pressburger objected to the American distributors renaming the film Stairway to Heaven, to no avail. The distributor believed that American audiences would not want to see a film with the word "Death" in the title, especially just after World War II. When Powell pointed out that the 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday was released without any problems, he was told that the title was acceptable because death was holidaying.

===The identities and significance of the statues===
Lining the escalator are large statues of historically prominent men. A list of the names of the statues appears in Michael Powells handwriting on pages 49 and 50 of the script. 

They are:

Many of these have in common a characteristic beyond their prominence in politics, art and philosophy: in 1945 most were believed to have had epilepsy (as did John Bunyan, seen in the film serving as the conductor for Dr. Reeves). 

===Anglo-American relations===
 
 
The film was originally suggested by a British government department to improve relations between the Americans in the UK and the British public  following Powell and Pressburgers contributions to this sphere in   American citizen afterward.

May I bring you up to date, sir? We are not alive at all." But, due to sample clearance issues, several songs including this one had to be re-recorded for the US release of their album, The_Wolfgang Press#Queer .281991.29.2C_A_Girl Like_You .281992.29|Queer.
