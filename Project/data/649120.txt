}} romantic comedy action adventure film directed by Renny Harlin. The film stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, and Frank Langella.  The film, having endured a notoriously troubled and chaotic production involving multiple rewrites and recasts, received mixed reviews from critics and became a massive box office bomb. It was the last film from Carolco Pictures before its closure, until the companys relaunch in 2015. 

==Plot==
In 1668 Jamaica, Morgan Adams hunts down her uncle and fellow pirate Dawg Brown, who has captured her father, Black Harry. Black Harry has one of three pieces of a map to a huge stash of gold on the remote Cutthroat Island. Dawg has another piece, having stolen it from the corpse of a third brother, Richard, while a fourth brother, Mordechai, has the last piece. Harry refuses to give Dawg his piece and escapes with Morgans help, but not before being mortally wounded. A dying Harry reveals to his daughter the location of the map piece: on his scalp.

After scalping her dead father for the piece, Morgan, now the captain of her fathers ship, the Morning Star, sets out for the treasure. Unfortunately, the instructions appear to be in Latin, which no one on board reads. So, they go to nearby Port Royal to find a translator. There, they learn that one of the slaves up for auction, a con man and thief named William Shaw, is fluent in Latin. After threatening a man determined to outbid her, Morgan wins the auction. Unfortunately, she is recognized from her wanted poster and is chased out of town (which is demolished), along with her crew and Shaw. Humiliated, corrupt Governor Ainslee vows to find her, either to arrest her or form a partnership for half her profits. He enlists the help of chronicler John Reed, who often follows pirates to write his books.

The crew then goes to Mordechai in Spittlefield Harbor. Before they can learn where the second piece is, Dawg appears. A fight ensues, during which Mordechai is killed and Morgan is shot, while Shaw secretly finds the piece and keeps it to himself. After they escape on the Morning Star, Morgan collapses from her wound, but is saved by Shaw, who is a self-proclaimed doctor. The two start a romance. Morgan figures out that the words on the map, when read backwards, spell out half the coordinates to the island.

Dawgs ship, the Reaper, bears down on them. Morgan directs hers toward a coral reef... and a gale. Shaw manages to piece together the location of Cutthroat Island with his and Morgans piece, but is caught and thrown in the brig. During the storm, Reed sends a carrier pigeon revealing their location to Ainslee. Meanwhile, the majority of the crew led by the treacherous Scully mutinies against Morgan and maroon her and those loyal to her in a boat. Fortuitously, though the boat is wrecked, the tide takes them straight to Cutthroat Island.

As Morgan goes after the treasure, Shaw, who escaped during the storm, steals the last piece from Dawg, whos on the island. Shaw falls into quicksand and Morgan, realizing he has the piece, frees him. Together, they find the gold, only for it to be stolen by Dawg, forcing them to jump off a cliff into the tide.

After regaining consciousness, Shaw finds Reed, who leads him into a trap set by Dawg, Ainslee, and the mutineers, who have joined forces and intend to split the gold between them. As Shaw is captured and they make their way out to sea with the gold, Morgan sneaks aboard the Morning Star and retakes it from Scully and the mutineers.

The crew then tries to sneak attack the Reaper, but Dawg counterattacks. A sea fight ensues, during which Shaw escapes and Ainslee, his men and Reed are killed by cannon fire. Morgan boards the Reaper and blows out the ships bottom to get to the gold. She then duels Dawg while Shaw gets trapped below in rapidly rising water with the treasure. Morgan kills Dawg with a cannon and saves Shaw, forced to abandon the treasure to escape the sinking ship. Luckily, Morgan uses a trick to retrieve the treasure and the newly rich crew sets sail for their next adventure in Madagascar.

==Production==
At the time the film was produced, Geena Davis and director Renny Harlin were married. Harlin convinced producer Mario Kassar to cast Davis, who was known for light comedies, in hopes that it would turn her into an action-adventure star.

Michael Douglas originally agreed to play Shaw under two conditions: filming had to start immediately because he was available only for a limited time, and his character had to have the same amount of screen time as Geena Davis. Douglas eventually pulled out, claiming that Daviss role was expanded at his characters expense. Davis wanted to quit when Douglas did, but she was contractually obligated to finish the film. After Douglas quit, Harlin was so preoccupied with trying to find a male lead that set construction and script work were done without his input. Harlin didnt like what he saw when shooting was set to begin, leading to massive expensive rebuilding and rewriting.
 cameo as Mordechai Fingers, but was fired after getting in a bar fight and threatening to expose himself to Davis. George Murcell eventually took his place. "Id heard these stories about Oliver Reed," said Modine, "I think it is all bunk. Oliver was a gentleman. Sure, he had a reputation as a man who enjoyed a drink. But only off set. His reputation as an actor is stellar. Professional. I stand by that. God rest his soul."  

==Release and reception==
Cutthroat Island had a total production budget of $98 million (though some put the figure as high as $115 million)  and the total U.S. gross was $10,017,322.  In 2014, the Los Angeles Times|LA Times listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.  It may have been a contributing factor to the demise of the films production company, Carolco Pictures, and of Davis as a bankable star. It debuted at No. 13 at the US box office.  The film has a 37% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 38 reviews.

Harlin was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director for his work on the film, but lost to Paul Verhoeven for Showgirls (another film produced by Carolco).

===Aftermath and legacy=== box office failure. He pointed out that Carolco was already in ruin before Cutthroat Island even began shooting, but had to make the film since financing from foreign investors was already in place. MGM, the Film distributor|films distributor, was in the process of being sold and thus could not devote itself into financing a marketing campaign for the film.  Carolco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a month before Cutthroat Islands release. 

The abject disaster of Cutthroat Island is also credited with significantly reducing the bankability and Hollywood production of   in 2003. 

===Music===
 
By contrast, the films swashbuckling orchestral score by composer John Debney has been critically acclaimed, and compared with the classic works of Erich Wolfgang Korngold.   
 

==Video game==
 
A side-scrolling beat-em up was made by Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim, and released for the major platforms of the time (such as the Super NES, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy) to tie-in with the film. It loosely follows the events of the film.
