==Plot==
===John Holmes and Dawn Schiller=== John Holmes, Dawn Schiller, is on the streets and picked up by a holy roller after she and Holmes break up. She eventually calls Holmes to come and get her. Holmes arrives at the apartment and they have sex and snort cocaine in the bathroom. While in a motel room, Dawn sees a newscast that states four people were murdered at a rowhouse on Wonderland Avenue, the same one she had earlier been in with Holmes. The story eventually moves on to two city detectives, Sam Nico and Louis Cruz, investigating the crime and their contact with Holmes. Another officer and colleague of Holmes, Billy Ward, intervenes in the investigation.

===David Linds story=== David Lind. He hears of his friends murders at Wonderland and soon discovers his girlfriend was there. While at the crime scene, he is picked up by Nico and Cruz. Through Linds story (told in Flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks), we are introduced to some of the people who party at Wonderland. These people, known as the Wonderland Gang include Ron Launius and his wife Susan, Billy Deverell, Linds 22-year old girlfriend Barbara Richardson, and Joy Miller. Ron has a fondness for antique guns and frequently shows them off. When he learns that Holmes knows notorious gangster Eddie Nash, he gives Holmes a pair of stolen antique guns to take to Nash so that Nash can fence them and they can split the loot (Nash befriended Holmes because of Holmes notoriety as the porn film phenomenon Johnny Wadd.) Holmes takes the guns to Nash, but Nash says the guns are too rare to be sold, as they would be recognized right away and everyone involved would be apprehended. Rather than give the guns back to Holmes, Nash keeps them for himself. Attempting to get back in the gangs good graces, Holmes suggests robbing Nashs home. Ron Launius is reluctant to go along with the robbery at first, but after Holmes gives him a rundown of whats there, he is eager to participate. Holmes volunteers to draw them a map to plan the robbery, since he has visited Nashs house frequently. Holmes then visits Nash to buy drugs. On the way out, he leaves the door to the kitchen unlocked to give the Wonderland gang easy access.

===The robbery of Eddie Nash=== accidentally fires his gun, wounding Nashs bodyguard, Greg Diles. The gang hurls racial epithets at Nash and Diles and walks away with over one million dollars in cash, jewels, and drugs. They bring their loot back to the Wonderland apartment to divide everything up. Holmes is unhappy with the cut he is given, even though he did not take part in the robbery.
 little black book. He tells Holmes he will kill every person listed in the book, starting with his mother, if he does not give up the men who robbed him.

===July 1, 1981===
The retaliation for the robbery is swift and fatal. On July 1, 1981, a group of Nashs henchmen (including Holmes), led by Diles, gains access to the apartment at Wonderland Avenue. Ron Launius, Deverell, Richardson, and Miller are all brutally beaten to death with striated lead pipes. Diles compels Holmes to deliver blows to Launius. Susan Launius is beaten but not killed. She survives and is questioned by Nico and Cruz in her hospital bed. She tells them (in a near comatose state) that she does not remember anything, only shadows. Lind is not present during the attacks.
