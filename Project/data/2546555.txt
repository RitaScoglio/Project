The Tramp is Chaplins sixth film for Essanay Studios in 1915. Directed by Chaplin, it was the fifth and last film made at Essanays Niles, California studio.    The Tramp marked the beginning of The Tramp character most known today, even though Chaplin played the character in earlier films.  This film marked the first departure from his more slapstick character in the earlier films, with a sad ending and showing he cared for others, rather than just himself. The film co-stars Edna Purviance as the farmers daughter and Ernest Van Pelt as Ednas father.  The outdoor scenes were filmed on location near Niles.
