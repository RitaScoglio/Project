==Plot== kingpin Dutch Schultz.

A dancer from Dixies neighborhood, Sandman Williams, is hired with his brother by the Cotton Club, a jazz club where most of the performers are black and the customers white. Owney Madden, a mobster, owns the club and runs it with his right-hand man, Frenchy.

Dixie becomes a Hollywood film star, thanks to the help of Madden and the mob but angering Schultz. He also continues to see Schultzs moll, Vera Cicero, whose new nightclub has been financed by the jealous gangster.

In the meantime, Dixies ambitious younger brother Vincent becomes a gangster in Schultzs mob and eventually a public enemy, holding Frenchy as a hostage.

Sandman alienates his brother Clay at the Cotton Club by agreeing to perform a solo number there. While the clubs management interferes with Sandmans romantic interest in Lila, a singer, its cruel treatment of the performers leads to an intervention by Harlem criminal "Bumpy" Rhodes on their behalf.

Dutch Schultz is violently dealt with by Maddens men while Dixie and Sandman perform on the Cotton Clubs stage.

==Production== Robert Evans William Kennedy and Francis Ford Coppola to re-write Mario Puzos story and screenplay. Evans eventually decided that he did not want to direct the film and asked Coppola at the last minute.  Richard Sylbert claimed that he told Evans not to hire Coppola because "he resents being in the commercial, narrative, Hollywood movie business".    Coppola claimed that he had letters from Sylbert that ask him to work on the film because Evans was crazy. The director also said that "Evans set the tone for the level of extravagance long before I got there". 
 William Kennedy Vanity Fair, the budget of the film was $47 million. However, Coppola told the head of Gaumont, Europes largest distribution and production company, that he thought the film might cost $65 million.

Author Mario Puzo was the original screenwriter and was eventually replaced by William Kennedy  who wrote a rehearsal script in eight days which the cast used for three weeks prior to shooting. According to actor Gregory Hines, a three-hour film was shot during rehearsals. 

Over 600 people built sets, created costumes and arranged music at a reported $250,000 a day. 

From July 15 to August 22, 1983, 12 scripts were produced, including five during one 48-hour non-stop weekend. Kennedy estimates that between 30â€“40 scripts were turned out. 

On June 7, 1984, Victor L. Sayyah filed a lawsuit against the Doumani brothers, their lawyer David Hurwitz, Evans and Orion Pictures for fraud and breach of contract.    Sayyah invested $5 million and claimed that he had little chance of recouping his money because the budget escalated from $25 to $58 million. He accused the Doumanis of forcing out Evans and that an Orion loan to the film of $15 million unnecessarily increased the budget. Evans, in turn, sued Edward Doumani to keep from acting as general partner on the film.
