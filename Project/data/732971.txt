}} drama series directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski  and co-written by Kieślowski with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, with music by Zbigniew Preisner.  It consists of ten one-hour films, inspired by the Ten Commandments.  Each short film explores one or several moral or ethical issues faced by characters living in modern Poland.

The series is Kieślowskis most acclaimed work, has been said to be "the best dramatic work ever done specifically for television"   and has won numerous international awards, though it was not widely released outside Europe until the late 1990s.  Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick wrote an admiring foreword to the published screenplay in 1991. 

==Production== cameo roles, observing the characters of the first episode of The Decalogue series.]]
Though each film is independent, most of them share the same setting (a large  , is a black comedy, and features two of the same actors, Jerzy Stuhr and Zbigniew Zamachowski.

The series was conceived when Krzysztof Piesiewicz, who had seen a 15th-century artwork illustrating the Commandments in scenes from that time period, suggested the idea of a modern equivalent. Krzysztof Kieślowski was interested in the philosophical challenge and also wanted to use the series as a portrait of the hardships of Polish society, while deliberately avoiding the political issues he had depicted in earlier films. He originally meant to hire ten different directors, but decided to direct the films himself, though using a different cinematographer for each with exception of episodes III and IX, both of which used Piotr Sobociński as director of photography. 

==Themes== Roger Eberts introduction to the DVD set,  Kieślowski said that the films did not correspond exactly to the commandments, and never used their names himself.

It is surely beyond doubt that the themes of The Decalogue can be interpreted in many different ways; however, each film has its own literality:

==Reception==
The Decalogue was admired by critics as well as by important figures from the film industry such as Stanley Kubrick. 
 Robert Fulford. 
 David Denby, Three Colors Red/Blue, and The Double Life of Veronique. 

In 2002, the film was also listed among the Top 100 "Essential Films" of all time by the National Society of Film Critics    and ranked #36 in Empire (magazine)|Empire magazines "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" in 2010. 

==Longer feature films==
 
Kieślowski expanded Five and Six into longer feature films (A Short Film About Killing and A Short Film About Love), using the same cast and changing the stories slightly. This was part of a contractual obligation with the producers, since feature films were easier to distribute outside Poland. In 2000, the series was released on five DVDs, each containing two parts of about 2 hours.
