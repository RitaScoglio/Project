==Production== The 49th Parallel (1941), notably scenes between Raymond Massey and Laurence Olivier. While there he came up with the idea for a film about six English pilots escaping through occupied Europe, the reverse situation of The 49th Parallel. 

Vincent Sherman was considered to direct; he wrote to Hal Wallis saying he loved the central concept and thought the basic idea was good but "its greatest weakness was that it didnt have a story... once the men make their first escape you could very easily leave out every following sequence and simply go to the end without losing anything in so far as story is concerned". 
 Gentleman Jim for the studio but they postponed it so he could star in Desperate Journey instead.  The movie was rushed into production in order to take advantage of Americas recent entry into the war, which meant the problems in the script identified by Sherman were never really fixed up.

Prior to and during filming, uncredited work on the script was done by Julius and Philip Epstein. Director Raoul Walsh said "they have added a little zip to the script" and asked for them to keep working on it from a memo from Raoul Walsh to Hal Wallis dated February 13, 1942. 
 Lake Sherwood Point Mugu Point Hueneme) Van Nuys Lockheed aircraft plant, and was able to "borrow" a production Lockheed Hudson bomber for the film that was already destined for RAF use.  The other aircraft that is featured prominently in the film, mainly through a mock-up (shot on Warners Sound Stage 16) and in model work is the contemporary United States and RAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. 

Ronald Reagan, an air force reservist before World War II, received his call for active service while the film was in production.   While Warners lobbied the government for a 30-day extension, the US Army was only willing to offer two weeks, forcing Walsh to shoot scenes with Reagan out of sequence, and to use a double for some scenes. 

After beginning his film career, Reagan called himself the "B movie Errol Flynn", but in Desperate Journey, he shared top billing with Flynn.    He made the most out of the films showcase scene, his fast-paced doubletalk in the interrogation by Massey. Flynn also lobbied intensely to get the scene but despite a closed-door shouting match with director Walsh, the producer insisted that no changes to the script would be accepted. Steinberg, Jay S.   Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: July 10, 2014.  

Fresh from his acclaimed effort in Kings Row (1942), Reagan was at the high point of his career, making the transition from supporting to lead actor in studio features, and about to sign a seven-year contract with Warner Bros.  In post-war years, Reagans Hollywood career would never regain the same momentum before he was called up for duty. 

During production, Flynns February 1942 draft board physical revealed the presence of tuberculosis in his right lung. Unwilling to face an extended unpaid layoff, Flynn hid his condition from Warners.  Between his illness and Walshs exacting schedule, as the shoot progressed, Flynn dropped to 165 pounds. His wardrobe first was refitted, and then ultimately padded. Due to illness, Flynn was often late.  

==Reception==
The film had its world premiere in Libertyville, in a special screening to raise money for war bonds. 
===Box Office===
Desperate Journey went on to gross $2 million for Warners Bros., the third Flynn film of that year to reach that coveted mark, according to Variety. Studio bosses were aware the film was being screened during Flynns rape trial, yet the negative publicity actually enhanced ticket sales. Thomas et al. 1969, p. 114.  
===Critical reaction=== Man Hunt (1941). Orriss 1994, p. 57.  His review centered on the frenzy of the action. "And such hair-raising, side-splitting adventures as they have in a wild-goose trek across Germany â€” such slugging of guards and Raymond Massey, such chases and incidental sabotage youll not see this side of the comics, or possibly an old-time Western film." 
===Awards===
Desperate Journey was nominated for the Academy Award for Visual Effects (Byron Haskin and Nathan Levinson) at the 15th Academy Awards.   oscars.org, May 22, 2013.
