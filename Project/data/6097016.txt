Guns Dont Argue  is a 1957 low-budget feature film about the early achievements of the FBI in defeating the most notorious criminals of the 1930s. The film involves dramatizations of the crimes and eventual demise of various gangsters, along with a moralistic narrative. It was edited together from a composite of three episodes from the 1952 TV series Gangbusters. 

==Production== Richard Kahn. 
 Gang Busters (1954), was also originally based on the dramatic radio program first titled G-Men, which premiered on July 20, 1935. The title was changed to Gang Busters on January 15, 1936.

==Plot==
The film takes the form of a docudrama in which Federal agents speak to camera about the war on gangsterism in the 1930s. Using contacts with gun molls, agents track down criminals. The film dramatizes the crime careers, and final capture or deaths of John Dillinger, the Barker Gang (Ma Barker, Fred Barker, Arthur Barker, Alvin Karpis), Bonnie and Clyde, Homer Van Meter and Pretty-Boy Floyd.

==Portrayal of events== revisionist style Hoover style film with narration of the criminal element in an over emphasized way. Though the film does show a counterpoint to the often romanticized lives of outlaws and criminals, it does so too far in the extreme. Where the real history gets muddled in the 1950s value system. 

Most notable is the portrayal of the deaths of Bonnie and Clyde as well as John Dillinger. The scenes show each firing off the first shot, and having ample time to "give themselves up". When in fact they were gunned down in an ambush by the police and Federal agents.

The movie was greatly admired by Martin Scorsese, who has said, "Its an amazing film. Its to be studied, because it shows you how to make a film on a low budget".
