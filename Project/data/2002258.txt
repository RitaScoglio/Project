 Michael Myers returning home to kill his niece Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), the daughter of Laurie Strode, with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) once more pursuing him.   

As the title suggests, this film marks the return of Michael Myers after being absent in the previous installment,  . Initially, John Carpenter and co-producer Debra Hill retired the Michael Myers storyline after the second installment of the series, intending to feature a new Halloween-season related plot every sequel, of which Halloween III would be the first—Halloween 4 was originally intended to be a ghost story.  However, due to the disappointing financial performance of the third film, Halloween 4 reintroduced Michael Myers.

==Plot==
Michael Myers has been in a coma for ten years since the explosion at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital and is being transferred to Smiths Grove Sanitarium via ambulance.  Upon hearing that he has a niece, Michael awakens, kills the paramedics, and makes his way to Haddonfield to look for her. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Michaels former psychiatrist, who also survived the explosion, learns of Michaels escape and gives chase. He follows Michael to a small gas station and eatery, where Loomis finds Michael has killed a mechanic for his clothes, along with a clerk. Michael then escapes in a tow truck and causes an explosion, destroying Loomiss car in the process.  Loomis catches a ride to Haddonfield to renew his search for Michael.

Meanwhile, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), the orphaned daughter of Laurie Strode and Michaels niece, is living in Haddonfield with her foster family, Richard and Darlene Carruthers, and their teenage daughter, Rachel.  It is Halloween and Jamies foster parents, Richard and Darlene, are heading out for the night and Rachel (Ellie Cornell) is left to baby-sit her, causing her to miss her date with her boyfriend Brady (Sasha Jenson). Jamie knows about her uncle Michael, but she is unaware he is the strange man she has been having nightmares about. After school, Rachel takes Jamie to buy ice cream and a Halloween costume. Michael has already arrived in Haddonfield, and almost attacks Jamie in the store. That night, Rachel takes Jamie trick-or-treating, and Michael goes to the electrical substation and murders a worker by throwing him into live high voltage parts, plunging the town into darkness. Dr. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield and teams up with Ben Meeker (Beau Starr), the new sheriff, whom he warns about Michaels escape and return. Michael single-handedly takes down a police station and slaughters the police force; later, a group of men form a lynch mob to hunt down Myers.

Rachel discovers her boyfriend Brady cheating on her with the Sheriffs daughter Kelly (Kathleen Kinmont), and loses Jamie. After being chased by Myers, Rachel reunites with Jamie.  Sheriff Meeker and Dr. Loomis arrive and take the girls to Sheriff Meekers house with Kelly and Brady, and a deputy. They lock and board up the house, and Loomis departs to look for Michael. With Meeker in the basement awaiting the arrival of the state police, Michael enters the house quietly and undetected. He kills a deputy off-screen, and then murders Kelly by impaling her with a shotgun. Rachel discovers the carnage, and races upstairs to get Jamie, but she is gone. Brady and Rachel realize they are trapped in the house, and Rachel finds Jamie. Michael appears and struggles with Brady before crushing his skull, killing him. Michael then chases Rachel and Jamie up to the attic. They climb through a window onto the roof and Jamie is lowered down safely, but Michael attacks Rachel and knocks her off the roof.  Being pursued by Michael, Jamie runs down the street, screaming for help and runs into Dr. Loomis.  They take shelter in the school, but Michael appears and throws Loomis through a glass door before chasing Jamie through the school.  Jamie trips and falls down a flight of stairs.  Before Michael can kill his niece, Rachel appears, alive, and sprays him in the face with a fire extinguisher.

The lynch mob and the state police arrive at the school after hearing the alarm.  Four men from the mob agree to take Jamie and Rachel over to the next town in a pick-up truck. Michael has hidden on the underside of the truck; he climbs into the bed of the truck and kills the men, including the driver. Rachel is forced to drive, continuously attempting to throw Michael off. She succeeds in doing so and saying "Die, you son of a bitch!", rams him with the truck, sending him flying into a ditch near an abandoned mine. The police arrive and as Jamie approaches Michael and touches his hand, he rises. The police shoot Michael until he falls down the abandoned mine and is presumed dead.

Jamie and Rachel are taken home and Darlene and Richard—who have arrived home—console their traumatized children. Darlene goes upstairs to run Jamie a bath, and Jamie, overwhelmed by Michaels essence, dons a clown mask and stabs her stepmother with a pair of scissors, though not fatally. The film ends with Jamie standing at the top of the stairs with the scissors in her hand and stained with blood, with Dr. Loomis screaming as Richard, Rachel and Sheriff Meeker stare in horror.

| style="text-align: left;" |"Halloween was banned in Haddonfield and I think that the basic idea was that if you tried to suppress something, it would only rear its head more strongly. By the very   of trying to erase the memory of Michael Myers,   were going to ironically bring him back into existence."

|}

However, Akkad rejected the Etchison script, calling it "too cerebral" and insisting that any new Halloween sequel must feature Myers as a flesh and blood killer.  In an interview, Etchison explained how he received the phone call informing him of the rejection of his script. Etchison said, "I received a call from Debra Hill and she said, Dennis, I just wanted you to know that John and I have sold our interest in the title Halloween and unfortunately, your script was not part of the deal." 

Carpenter and Hill had signed all of their rights away to Akkad, who gained ownership. Akkad says, "I just went back to the basics of Halloween on Halloween 4 and it was the most 
successful."  As Carpenter refused to continue his involvement with the series, a new director was sought out. Dwight H. Little, a native of Ohio, replaced Carpenter. Little had previously directed episodes for Freddys Nightmares and the film Bloodstone (1988 film)|Bloodstone.

===Writing=== Halloween II, goes looking for Michael with Sheriff Meeker. The setting of the place was once again Haddonfield, Illinois. The character of Laurie Strode was revealed to have died in a car accident, leaving Britti with the Carruthers family, which included Rachel, the familys seventeen-year-old daughter. Brittis name was later changed to Jamie, a homage to Laurie Strode actress Jamie Lee Curtis.

McElroy told Fangoria:
 

In the original draft, Sheriff Ben Meeker was to be killed during the Shapes attack on the Meeker house. A fire would have started in the basement and burnt down the entire house. The scene on top of the roof with the Shape, Rachel, and Jamie was supposed to be engulfed in flames. This was cut due to budget issues.    A more "soap opera" feel was added to the film, which included the triangle of the teenagers and their relationship situations. Rachel is dating Brady, who is also having sex with Kelly Meeker. In addition, in the finale, Jamie was originally intended to have murdered her foster mother, Darlene Carruthers, while drawing the bath, and become evil. This idea was rejected for   (1989).

===Casting===
The cast of Halloween 4 included only one actor from the first two films,   (1998). As a result, her character was written out and supposedly died in a car accident, which is briefly explained in the film.

The script introduced Laurie Strodes seven-year-old daughter, Jamie Lloyd.   (1988) as the role of Kristen Parker, after Patricia Arquette had declined to return as Kristen. Cornell chose Halloween 4 and successfully landed the role of Rachel. Beau Starr was cast as the new Sheriff, Ben Meeker, replacing Sheriff Lee Brackett (Charles Cyphers), and Kathleen Kinmont was cast as the Sheriffs daughter, Kelly. George P. Wilbur was cast to play Michael Myers.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on April 11, 1988. Instead of filming in Pasadena, California (the original filming location and stand in for Haddonfield) due to high-rising costs, filming took place in Salt Lake City, Utah.  As filming was taking place in March,  during springtime, the producers were forced to import leaves and big squash, which they would use to create pumpkins by painting them orange, which was also done during the filming of the original Halloween. "One of the obvious challenges in making a part four of anything is to interest a contemporary audience in old characters and themes," said director Dwight H. Little. "What Im trying to do is capture the mood of the original Halloween and yet take a lot of new chances. What were attempting to do is walk a fine line between horror and mystery. Halloween 4 will not be an ax-in-the-forehead kind of movie." Paul Freeman agreed. "This film does contain some humorous moments, but its not of the spoof or send-up variety. Its humor that rises out of the films situations and quickly turns back into terror."   

George P. Wilbur, who was cast as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume to make himself look more physically imposing. During filming, the cast and crew made it a point to take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and he was not going to hurt her. 

The late night scenes caused issues with the cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He was rushed to the hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she continued filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold that he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days. 
 Captain Kirk mask be reused for this film. However, the mask was long gone and a new one was purchased from a local costume shop. The producers wanted to test and see what it would look like without the edits. The school scene was filmed and when reviewing the producers did not like how the mask turned out. It was allegedly customized again but did not live up to the original, and the producers felt it was too old and went for a new mask. Some scenes had to be re-shot with the new mask. The only scene left in is when Loomis is thrown through a glass door; as Michael comes up behind him, the unaltered face and blonde hair is visible. 

After viewing the films  ) was brought in to create the thumb in the forehead kill and neck-twisting of the redneck seen in the films final cut.

===Music===
The score was performed by Alan Howarth, who had assisted John Carpenter on Halloween II and Halloween III. Howarth gained approval from Dwight H. Little before he could accept the offer, creating a new score that referenced the originals but with a synthesizer twist. Howarth also included new tracks such as "Jamies Nightmare", "Return of the Shape", and "Police Station". The soundtrack was released to Compact Disc on September 28, 1988.
