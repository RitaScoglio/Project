 Gareth Williams). Meanwhile, rather than go to prison, Jimmy climbs to the top of the 31st Street Bridge and jumps off. His body is never found.

Two years later, Tom is working for the Pittsburgh Police River Rescue Squad when he is called to the scene of a body dump. The victim turns out to be a stewardess, Cheryl Putnam, with whom Tom had once been romantically involved. He is soon assigned a new partner, Jo Christman (Sarah Jessica Parker). District Attorney Frank Morris reveals (Andre Braugher) Tom had been demoted to River Rescue after he went on the news and publicly stated he believes the Polish Hill Strangler was a member of the police force. His cousin Danny Detillo (Tom Sizemore) has stepped down from the force and became an alcoholic. He has recently returned from California and has forgiven Tom for his role in Jimmys death.

At a hospital, a nurse is abducted. Tom receives a phone call similar to ones left by the Polish Hill Strangler two years earlier. He hears a woman scream before she is shot and the phone goes dead. Tom is sure the Polish Hill Strangler is still out there. However, Detective Eddie Eiler (Brion James) states on TV the murder was committed by a copycat. Tom is met with strong opposition by his uncle Nick Detillo (Dennis Farina), now a Captain, after claiming he received a phone call from the killer. Tom goes to the precinct and steals Chick Chicanis deposition file in order to conduct an unauthorized investigation.

While on river patrol, he tracks down Chicanis and tries to get him to talk at gunpoint, but is stopped by Christman. They get a call over the radio; the body of another woman whom Tom once dated has been found.

Later, at the Policemens Ball, a nasty brawl occurs between Tom and the officers in attendance. Jo pulls Tom away from the fight and takes him home. After a heated argument in Toms boathouse, the pair kiss passionately and proceed to have sex for the first time. Outside the boat, a mysterious person silently observes their lovemaking through the bedroom windows. 

The following day, Tom and Jo are on patrol and stumble upon the scene of someone dumping what appears to be a wrapped body off a bridge. Tom destroys the suspects car but the unidentified individual escapes on foot. Divers sent to retrieve the body from the river find it to merely to be a bunch of rugs. Tom is humiliated by his peers, which he and Jo suspect was the point of the incident.
 Internal Affairs. lies on the witness stand about Toms confrontation with Chicanis, and he goes unpunished.

Emily is kidnapped. After arriving home, Tom calculates the distances of the body dumps to be in close proximity to his Uncle Nicks old cabin. He suspects Danny is the killer, seeking revenge for Jimmy.

Tom finds his bedroom trashed with blood and a firearm on the bed. Outside he finds another body, a police dispatcher he knows. Tom heads to the cabin. Danny shows up and Tom demands he cooperate. Someone from behind then knocks Tom cold.

Tom awakens to find himself, Danny, and Emily handcuffed to chairs, with the news broadcast of Jimmys brutality case playing on a TV. The killer reveals himself as none other than Jimmy Detillo, who had survived the fall into the river two years earlier. Jimmy is about to kill Emily when Nick suddenly walks in and stops him, telling him to turn himself in. Jimmy is defiant and commands Nick to tell Tom how Vince really died.

A flashback reveals Nick arrived on the scene immediately after the crash and was the first to confront the killer. He was horrified to find Jimmy, but let him escape. Vince pried himself out of the wreckage of Toms car and took aim at the fleeing killer, unaware it was Jimmy. Nick tried to stop him and, in the ensuing struggle, killed Vince.

After this revelation, Nick tries to kill Jimmy, who is wearing a ballistic vest and returns fire, killing Nick. In a fit of rage, Danny charges at Jimmy, giving Tom a chance to free himself. As the police close in, Jimmy flees on a motorboat with Tom in pursuit. The two get into a scuffle in which Tom kills Jimmy by tasering him in his mouth. Eiler helps remove the cuffs from Toms wrists, apologizing in the process, prompting Tom to punch Eiler in the face.

The movie ends with Tom, reinstated as a detective, visiting his fathers grave with Emily and her daughter Sarah.

== Reception ==
Striking Distance received negative reviews from critics, as it currently holds a 15% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film grossed $24.1 million domestically, barely recouping its $30 million budget. It was cited as one of the many troubled projects during the time Sony Pictures was run by Jon Peters and Peter Guber, and while it did not lose money or creatively embarrass the studio, it was a troubled production that took a huge amount of resources to merely break even.
