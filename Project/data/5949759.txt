==Reception==
In his review for The New York Times, John J. OConnor wrote, "Perhaps not surprisingly, these amoral entrepreneurs provide some of the films juicier roles. Especially effective is Benicio del Toro as the young, illiterate and flaky Rafael Caro-Quintero".  In his review for USA Today, Matt Roush wrote, "For a Michael Mann production, theres surprisingly little flash to Drug Wars. Some interesting camera work to be sure, including the video bits and some heightened use of slow motion, but the miniseries chief strength is its grit, its anger".  Craig MacInnis, in his review for the Toronto Star, wrote, "Interspersed with U.S. network news footage of the real Camarena incident in 85, the dramatic scenes in Drug Wars are never anything less than convincing - just as good propaganda should be". 

==DVD Release==
All three parts originally ran for four hours. The current DVD release features a heavily edited version that runs only 130 minutes.
