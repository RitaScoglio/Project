In his room, Haruka reveals to him that Sone had been dying of cancer. Although Shūichi regrets his actions, in order to keep Ishioka quiet, he fools Ishioka into staging a robbery at his workplace.

However, police officer Masashi Kano (Baijaku Nakamura), who also met Shūichi at the time of Sones murder, finds flaws in Shūichis claims and actions.

While seeing Noriko home at the train station, Shūichi admits to her that he is a murderer.
