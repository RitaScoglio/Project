==Production== Oscar Wilde. West End seven weeks after they had started filming. 

==Reception==
In his review of the film,   that opened   last week, this one is more impressive in every respect, save one."  , a 28 June 1960 review from The New York Times  Crowther concludes the review saying "The only thing is you wonder if this is a fairly true account, if Mr. Wilde was as noble and heroic as he is made to appear. And if he was, what was he doing with those cheap and shady young men? It looks to us as if they are trying to whitewash a most unpleasant case, which is one of the more notorious and less ennobling in literary history." 
 the B&W film is in the remarkable impact of the libel case court sequence. James Mason never provides the strength and bitter logic necessary for the dramatic cut-and-thrust when Wilde is in the witness box." 

==Awards== BAFTA nominations Best British Best Film from any source and for John Fraser as Best British Actor. Peter Finch (tied with Bambang Hermanto) also received the Best Actor Award at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival.   

==Influence== Peter Whitehead, featured Mick Jagger as Wilde, Keith Richards as the Marquis, and Marianne Faithfull as Lord Alfred Douglas|Bosie.
