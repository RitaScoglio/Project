Brian Wilson Presents Smile (also referred to as Smile or the abbreviation BWPS)  Peter Ames Carlin|Carlin,  Domenic Priore|Priore,  Lambert,  and Wilsons official website.  Smile or BWPS according to David Leaf|Leaf.  }} is the sixth studio album by Brian Wilson, released in September 2004. It began as a series of concert performances which were later adapted for a 2005 direct-to-video concert film of the same name. The album received great acclaim and earned Wilson his first Grammy Award,  later being featured in several "greatest albums" lists.  

The project was originally conceptualized in 1966 as Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile, a studio album recorded by the Beach Boys and written in collaboration between Wilson and lyricist Van Dyke Parks. It was intended to succeed the groups album Pet Sounds and was based on the engineering methods of their single "Good Vibrations". Many years after the project was shelved due to personal and technical difficulties with recording, Wilson chose to revisit the material with Parks as a specially arranged live concert performance. Motivated by the unexpected positive reception, a studio-recorded version was then released by Wilson as a solo album.

Recorded from scratch, Brian Wilson Presents Smile eschews the Beach Boys Smile sessions by containing all-new instrumental and vocal performances. Recordings from the original Beach Boys sessions were later released as The Smile Sessions in 2011. It featured a reconstruction of the Beach Boys Smile album that loosely followed the track listing template never before established until the release of Brian Wilson Presents Smile.

==Background==
  draft battle, and Brian Wilsons escalating drug use, mental health issues, and creative dissatisfaction with the project.

==Resurrection== Pet Sounds Live, they were shocked to find Wilson approved the idea.  Starting in 2003, he proceeded to complete the albums unfinished structure from memory with help from his band and original Smile lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The new version of the album and its performance was made whole by the addition of either lost or newly composed lyrics by Parks that filled gaps left open by the unfinished 1966–67 Beach Boys sessions.  On May 22, 2003, it was formally announced that Wilson and his band were to perform a live reinterpretation of Smile at the Royal Festival Hall in London.   

 " and "  themes. 

Parks was not initially involved in the project.    Its said that during rehearsals between Wilson and Sahanaja for the unfinished song "Do You Like Worms?", Wilson was able to recall the tracks original melody, but not the lyrics. Confronted with this dilemma, he telephoned Parks for help. Parks soon showed up at Wilsons doorstep, and the two extended their collaborations on several other tracks arrangements and lyrics.  For these new versions, Wilson, Parks, Sahanaja, and woodwind player/string arranger Paul Mertens based their arrangements on the original, unreleased Beach Boys tapes to give it an updated yet non-anachronistic sound.   

==Performance==
  in London was where Wilson chose to debut Smile with his band. ]]

On February 20, 2004, a live performance of the newly completed version of Smile was enacted by Wilson along with his backing band, which included former Beach Boys guitarist Jeff Foskett, members of Wondermints and percussionist Nelson Bragg at the Royal Festival Hall in London.  Among those in attendance that first night were Paul McCartney and George Martin.  Other attendants included Jason Pierce of Spiritualized  and Paul Weller.  It was presented in the form of three movement (music)|movements, with a half-hour intermission between movements two and three.  Upon completion, Wilson received a lengthy standing ovation and invited a tearful Parks onstage.   Sahanaja reported that afterwards, Wilson rocked back and forth backstage — out of relief that he had finally conquered his fear of Smile — exclaiming "Darian! Darian! We did it! We did it!"   The performance was then repeated at the Royal Festival Hall five more times for the next five nights, with each playing recorded for posterity on film and a 48-track Genex hard disk recorder. 
 Do It Again". 
 British dominance of pop culture during the time of the albums inception.       It follows a musical journey across America from east to west, beginning at Plymouth Rock and ending in Hawaii, as well as traversing some of the great themes of American history and culture. It seems chronological, moving from early America through the Victorian era and ending with Hawaii, which in terms of American statehood was still a very new state for 1966. In subsequent interviews to promote the album, Brian has concentrated on the happy, humorous qualities of the music, which are evident.  Lyricist Parks has said that Brian has a "cartoon consciousness." 

===Movements one and two===
  Roll Plymouth medley of "You Are My Sunshine" and "The Old Master Painter", and finally "Cabinessence".
 Song for Children", "Child Is Father of the Man", and the closer "Surfs Up (song)|Surfs Up".

===Movement three===
 
The third movement refers to " ", and "In Blue Hawaii".

"The Elements" are represented by "Vega-Tables" (Earth), "Wind Chimes" (Air), "Mrs. OLearys Cow" (Fire), and "In Blue Hawaii" (Water). 
Smiles final track, "Good Vibrations", replaces the well-known lyrics of Mike Love with earlier lines penned by Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher. However, since Asher never wrote lyrics for the completed version, it was still necessary to use some of Loves lyrics, and credit him along with Asher and Wilson. It also includes an extended "humm-be-dumm" harmony section taken from an alternate 1966 edit of the song. "Good Vibrations" broadly goes through three distinct phases, as the album does, and features a custom-made Electro-Theremin. 

==Studio recording==
 

Inspired by this success, Wilson began considering a studio recorded version of his Smile performances.  After two weeks, it was decided to go ahead, and so Brian Wilson Presents Smile became a fully-fledged studio album.    Recording began in April 2004 with his ten-piece touring band, augmented by a ten-piece string section and an acoustic bassist. The basic tracks were recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in four days, with overdubbing and mixing continuing until July with some stops at engineer Mark Linetts Your Place or Mine studio.  Wilson began a Smile tour during these recording sessions.

When played live,   identical to the one used by the Beach Boys at United Western Recorders in the 1960s. 

==Album release==
On September 28, 2004, Brian Wilson released his newly recorded studio version of Brian Wilson Presents Smile. This was followed by two US tours, with its featured stop in New Yorks Carnegie Hall; a combination of the two shows were broadcast on NPRs Creators at Carnegie series. The concert series also went to Australia and New Zealand, as well Europe. Three singles were released to promote the album:
* "Good Vibrations" was released on CD and 7" vinyl prior to the albums release and included live versions of "Our Prayer" and "Good Vibrations" from the live debut of Smile recorded at Royal Festival Hall, in London on February 20, 2004.
* "Our Prayer" was released in the United Kingdom as a one-sided 10" single on clear vinyl. The track was remixed as the Freeform Reform Version by the London band Freeform (musician)|Freeform.
* "Wonderful (The Beach Boys song)|Wonderful" had a limited release of 5,000 on blue, green, and yellow vinyl backed with "Wind Chimes". The vinyl only release charted at number 29 in the UK singles chart in its first week of release.
 The Mail on Sunday released Good Vibrations a free compilation which included rerecorded Beach Boys songs. In response to this, Mike Love filed a lawsuit seeking compensation, arguing the free CD had adversely affected demand for the original tracks. The suit was dismissed after the court found there were no triable issues.

}} Kije Suite. In its appropriation of American folk it stands up there with the work of Gershwin and Aaron Copland|Copland. In its sheer contemplative beauty it rubs shoulders with Miles Davis Kind of Blue. One of the greatest albums of the 21st century."    John Bush of AllMusic was less enthusiastic and believed Smile was "a remarkably unified, irresistible piece of pop music", yet decreed that it was "no musical watershed on par with Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band or Wilsons masterpiece, Pet Sounds".  

Smile received multiple nominations for the  ".    Smile also finished in second place in the Pazz & Jop, an annual critics poll run by The Village Voice.  Christgau, the polls creator, named it the best album of 2004 in his own list,  Pitchfork Media named it fifth best album of 2004    and the 25th best album released between 2000 and 2004.    Rolling Stone later named it the 88th best album of the 2000s decade.  In his ballot for the magazine, Christgau ranked it as the 20th best album of the decade. 

When asked for thoughts on the album, Beach Boy Al Jardine commented in 2013: "Honestly, I didn’t give it a whole lot of thought; I didn’t want to go there at that time. They were good enough to send me a copy.  So I dropped the needle, as they used to say, and listened to a few cuts, and it was very nice. But there’s nothin’ like the real thing. And remember the production value was quite unique to that period of time in the recording process. We used great outboard gear at the time – the tube gear, echo chambers and acoustical chambers and that made everything sound really great.  That’s what I like about the vintage stuff."
