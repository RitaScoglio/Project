==Production==
 Simran was signed on to be a part of the film in August 1999 after winning critical acclaim and commercial success in her previous appearance alongside Vijay in Ezhils Thulladha Manamum Thullum.  An item number was shot in 2000 with Vijay and Sophia Haque for the film. 

The films delay led to Azhagam Perumal being labelled by the media as an "unlucky director", also as his first film Mudhal Mudhalaaga starring Arvind Swamy and Karisma Kapoor had also failed to take off. He however signed on to direct Dumm Dumm Dumm, a film produced by Mani Ratnam, which became a box office success. 

Simran briefly announced her retirement from films after her marriage in December 2002 with producer Natarajan filing a case against the actress for failure to participate in shoot.  As the film finally geared up for release in the summer of 2004, trade pundits were insistent that despite the presence of Vijays other big budget film, Ghilli, time should be allotted to publicise Udhaya too. Eventually the films released a month apart. 

==Release==
The film opened to average reviews from critics. A reviewer from Bizhat.com labelled the film as "a jaded and disappointing fare", mentioning that the delay led to Vijay "changing from lean to chubby and back in the film".
