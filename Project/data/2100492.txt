Medicine Man (originally titled The Stand)    is a 1992 film directed by American action director John McTiernan. The film stars Sean Connery and Lorraine Bracco, and features an acclaimed score by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith.

== Plot == Amazonian rainforest to locate researcher Robert Campbell (Connery), after his wife and research partner abandon him.

Crane is bringing equipment and supplies, but Campbell is upset the research partner is not forthcoming. He tries to send Crane home, but she demurs, as she has been assigned to determine whether Campbells research deserves continued funding.

Campbell has found a cure for cancer, but attempts to synthesize the compound have failed. With supplies of the successful serum running low, Campbell isolates a derivative of a species of flower from which the formula can be synthesized and with Cranes help is determined to find its source.

A logging company is building a road headed straight for the village, threatening to expose the native population to potentially lethal foreign pathogens, as has happened before. In fact, Campbells wife left him because she could not forgive herself for the tragedy.

A small boy appears with malignant neoplasms and Campell, Crane, the boy, and his father set out in search of Campbells predecessor, a medicine man from whom Campbell once acquired his knowledge of flowers. Upon encountering Campbells entourage, the medicine man flees in fear. Though he is reluctant to pursue the man further, Crane convinces him circumstances demand that he must.

Campbell rescues Crane from a fall, then locates the medicine man, whom he is compelled to fight in order to heal the medicine mans wounded pride and gain further necessary information. Unfortunately, the medicine man reveals that the flowers have no "juju"—power to heal. Father and son agree to return another time.

Back at the village, Crane initially refuses to allow Campbell to inoculate the boy with the last of the serum until more can be synthesized. But when the boys condition worsens, she gives in and the boy is inoculated.

The next morning, the boy is better but the village is in tumult. The logging road is nearly finished. Campbell appeals to the companys workers to halt construction until he can conclude his research, but it refuses.
 indigenous to the rainforest. Campbell demands the construction stop. A fight results and a bulldozer catches fire, destroying the village and the research station along with many acres of rainforest.

The next day, Crane promises to send Campbell new equipment and the research assistant hed originally requested. She is about to return home when she meets the medicine man. He symbolically passes on his mantle to Campbell, and Crane accepts an invitation to continue working with him in exchange for recognition for co-discovering the source of the compound.
