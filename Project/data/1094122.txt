==Critical reception==
Lael Loewenstein, film critic for Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine, gave the film a mixed review and wrote, "The latest entry in the growing field of indie youth ensemble films, Bongwater is an uneven, intermittently likable movie about a group of Portland residents for whom getting high is a way of life. While its fresh-faced but largely unknown cast members frequently rise above the material, pic isnt distinctive enough to suggest it will yield more than a limited run in specialized markets."
