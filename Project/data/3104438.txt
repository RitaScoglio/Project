 French film director Robert Bresson. Joan of Arc is played by Florence Delay. 

As usual in Bressons mature films, The Trial of Joan of Arc stars non-professional performers and is filmed in an extremely spare, restrained style. Bressons screenplay is drawn from the transcriptions of Joans trial and rehabilitation.

Bressons Joan of Arc is often compared with The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) by Carl Theodor Dreyer. Bresson compared that film unfavorably with his own, expressing his dislike of the actors "grotesque buffooneries" in Dreyers film. 

==Synopsis==
In 1431 Jeanne, a French peasant girl, is imprisoned for heresy and brought to trial at Rouen. Despite rigorous interrogation by the judges and constant persecution from the jailers, her faith remains unshaken. The relentless theological questioning and argument in court is broken only by an ineffectual attempt at torture and an examination to prove her virginity. Jeannes insistence that her military ventures were bidden by God is scoffed at by the English, who are anxious to destroy the legend already building around her. In a moment of weakness during the trial, Jeanne recants her faith. She is sentenced to life imprisonment, but when she retracts her earlier confession, the court decrees that she be burned at the stake as a witch.
