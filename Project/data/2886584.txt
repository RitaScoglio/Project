}} Los Angeles, California.  Shot in 2003, the film failed to find a distributor and was released direct-to-video in 2005.

Miramax Films was the domestic distributor, but failed to release it in theaters.  When Harvey Weinstein screened the film he told the producers, "You have a hit movie on your hands.  Were going to blast this on MTV all over Super Bowl Weekend."   This was in December 2001.  The producers never heard about it again until 2005 when it was suddenly released Direct-to-DVD.

The film began principal photography in July 2001. Kathy Bates was originally slated to play the role of "Grandma Millicent Mirabeau", but dropped out after make-up/hair tests due to the shut down of the original production shoot date. Shirley MacLaine eventually stepped in to play the role of "Grandma Millicent Mirabeau".
