}} science fiction Godzilla series, the film had a strong anti-pollution message with director Banno being inspired after visiting a polluted beach near Yokkaichi. 

The film marked director Bannos directorial debut; however, the budget for Godzilla vs. Hedorah was significantly lower than previous Godzilla films. Banno was only given 35 days to shoot the film and only had one team available to shoot both the drama and monster effects scenes. Veteran Godzilla director Ishir≈ç Honda was later tasked by producer Tomoyuki Tanaka to watch Bannos rough cut and provide advice. 

The film was released theatrically in the United States in the spring of 1972 by American International Pictures as Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster.

==Plot==
The microscopic alien lifeform Hedorah feeds on Earths pollution and grows into a poisonous, acid-secreting sea monster. After it sinks an oil tanker and attacks Dr. Toru Yano and his young son Ken Yano, scarring them both, Hedorahs toxic existence is revealed to the public. Ken Yano has visions of Godzilla fighting the worlds pollution, and insists Godzilla will come to humankinds aid against Hedorah.

Hedorah metamorphoses into an amphibian form, allowing it to move onto land to feed on additional sources of pollution. Hedorah is confronted by Godzilla. Hedorah is easily overpowered by Godzilla and retreats into the sea. During the fight, however, several pieces of its new body are flung nearby, which then crawl back into the sea to grow anew and allow the monster to become even more powerful. It returns shortly thereafter in a flying saucer shape demonstrating new, even deadlier forms which it can switch between at will.

Thousands of people die in Hedorahs raids and even Godzilla is overwhelmed by Hedorahs poisonous emissions. As hope sinks, a party is thrown on Mt. Fuji to celebrate one last day of life before humankind succumbs to Hedorah. Ken Yano Yukio Keuchi and Miki Fujiyama.  Yukio Keuchi Get Killed By Hedorah as the other party-goers realizes that Godzilla and Hedorah have come to Mt. Fuji as well for a final confrontation.

Dr. Toru Yano and His Wife Toshie Yano has determined that drying out Hedorahs body may destroy the otherwise unkillable monster. The JSDF swiftly constructs two gigantic electrodes for this purpose, but their power is cut off by Godzilla and Hedorahs violent battle. Godzilla energizes the electrodes with his atomic ray, dehydrating Hedorahs outer body. Hedorah sheds this outer body and takes flight to escape, but Godzilla propels himself through the air with his atomic ray to give chase. Godzilla drags Hedorah back to the electrodes and continues to dehydrate it until Hedorah dies. Godzilla tears apart Hedorahs dried-out body and dehydrates the pieces until nothing remains but dust.

With Ken Yano and Miki Fujiyama calling after him, Godzilla returns to the sea, but not before glaring threateningly at the surviving humanity whose pollution spawned Hedorah.

Director Banno initially conceived the idea for Godzilla vs. Hedorah after seeing cities like Yokkaichi covered in black smog and the ocean filled with foam from dumped detergent and formulated the story of an alien tadpole transforming into a monster as a result of the pollution. 

Hedorahs origin is also unique for it is the only monster to be created from pollution. This was the first Godzilla film in several years to neither reuse an old monster (not counting Godzilla) or recycle footage from a previous movie in the series. This is noteworthy since the previous five films (made between 1965-1969) had increasingly done both. This film has the only occurrence of Godzilla flying under his own power. He uses his atomic ray as jet propulsion. Director Banno reportedly added the scene to provide a light moment in what is otherwise a fairly dark film compared to many of those which preceded it.

Kenpachiro Satsuma, the actor who played Hedorah, was struck with appendicitis during the production. Doctors were forced to perform the appendectomy while he was still wearing the Hedorah suit, due to the length of time it took to take off. During the operation, Satsuma learned that painkillers have no effect on him. 

== Canceled Sequel==
Yoshimitsu Banno was so pleased with Godzilla vs. Hedorah that he started writing another Godzilla film. An unnamed project, dubbed Godzilla vs. Hitodah on the site, was his first attempt, but he abandoned it in favor of a direct sequel to his 1971 Godzilla film called Godzilla vs. Hedorah 2. However,   (1988).

According to Banno though, from later interviews conducted with him, Godzilla vs. Hedorah 2 was actually still being worked on after he was removed from the project. Although who the new director would have been is unknown, but Jun Fukuda seems the most likely candidate considering that he would step up to direct the next three Godzilla films. If the film was going to keep its Africa setting at this stage is not known. The project was eventually scrapped, and three more proposed projects would be introduced that following year before finally settling on Godzilla vs Gigan (1972).

==English versions==

The film was released in April 1972 by American International Pictures under the title Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster. There were several small alterations: dialogue was dubbed to English, and the song "Save the Earth" (based on a song in the original Japanese version of the film) was added. This version was rated G by the MPAA, and the same version was given an A certificate by the BBFC for its UK theatrical release in 1975.
 international version, titled Godzilla vs. Hedorah. This version features a different English dub dubbed by Axis International and also lacks the English-language song, Save the Earth.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to the film has been mixed, with some embracing its eccentricity and others deriding it.

Japan Hero said the film is "recommended for Godzilla fans, but dont expect much out of it," adding that while "the special effects appear to be pretty good" and "watching it in its original   language does make the movie more tolerable," "the character designs ... are bad" and "the music ... really kills the movie."  Monster Zero criticized the films production values and said that it "succeeds in carrying the series over the edge into strictly kids stuff" and "begins the series inexorable slide into oblivion."  Stomp Tokyo said the film has "many obvious, crippling flaws" but added that "there are some good things," praising the monster action in particular.  In a review of Godzilla 1985, Roger Ebert cited it as his favorite of the Godzilla movies. 

American Kaiju called the film "a confused Godzilla non-epic that doesnt seem to be sure just who it was made for in the first place."  DVD Talk said it "earns points for trying something new, to break away from what was fast becoming a tired formula. The film isnt as entertaining as Godzilla vs. Gigan or Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, but it is more original and daring, and ... fans will want to pick   up." 

The U.S. dubbed version was featured in the 1978 book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. 

==Box office==
In Japan, the film sold 1,740,687 tickets.

==Legacy== monster battles Godzilla. However, he scrapped this idea and wrote what was going to be Godzilla vs. Hedorah 2. In it, Godzilla was to fight another Hedorah, this time in Africa. Due to Tomoyuki Tanakas reaction to Bannos first Godzilla film, this was never realized.

Banno spent several years trying to acquire funding for a 40-minute IMAX 3D Godzilla film starring a new version of Hedorah called Deathla. The project was tentatively titled Godzilla 3D: To The Max. The project was eventually scrapped but several members of the production team, including Banno, would work on the 2014 Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla. In November 2013, Banno stated that he still hoped to make a sequel to Godzilla vs. Hedorah. 

Hedorahs only other appearance is in  , where it appears alongside Ebirah in a single scene cameo and is defeated almost immediately. It is never stated what purpose Hedorah has in attacking Tokyo, and it is possible that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. In all likelihood, this appearance was merely as an extra monster to make the Xilien forces appear more numerous because the costume was on hand.
