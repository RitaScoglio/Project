Quincy Watson (Jamie Foxx) is unceremoniously dumped by his fianc√©e Helen, and pens a "how to" book on breaking up and becomes a best-selling author on the subject. Not wanting his male friends to suffer the same fate, he gives them advice on dumping their mates including his boss, Phillip, who is trying to break up with his gold-digger girlfriend Rita. After his cousin Evan (Morris Chestnut) reads Quincys book he starts to question his relationship with his girlfriend Nicky (Gabrielle Union).

Evan breaks up with her and goes over to his cousin and tells him to talk to her and convince her that Evans a good guy. Quincy doesnt know what she looks like, and Evan tells him that she has long black hair. That day, Nicky had cut her hair to a Halle Berry length. Quincy and Nicky end up sitting next to each other at the bar Nicky was supposed to meet Evan. Quincy tells her that hes looking for his cousins ex-girlfriend whose name is Nicky and has long black hair.

Nicky, knowing that Quincy is Evans cousin, lies and tells Quincy her name is Mary. While Quincy and Nicky were on their date, Rita finds out that Philip is planning to break up with her, and goes to Quincys house. When she gets there, Evan lies and says that hes Quincy. The two begin an affair. Evan goes to Nickeys house to break up with her. Nicky tells him that she was going to do the same, and that shes been seeing another man.

Evans goes to Quincys job and tells him that he thinks hes in love with Nicky, and that shes been seeing another man. During that conversation, Quincy realizes that Mary is actually Nicky. At the party for Quincys hot seller book, Helen is back from Paris and wants to get back with Quincy. Evans planned on proposing to Nicky at the party.

The next day, Evan talks to Quincy and tells him hes getting married to Rita. Phillip had a heart attack, and at the hospital, Rita finds out that Evan lied to her. Instead of getting mad, she says she fell in love with him. Quincy breaks up with Helen and goes to look for Nicky.
