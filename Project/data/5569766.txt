Hazard is divorced and hasnt seen his son in years due to the bitter divorce. After Willows father, who is a retired U.S. Army Master Sergeant and a former Korean War comrade in arms of Hazards as well Sgt. Major Nelsons, dies of a heart attack, Hazard comes to look upon Willow as a "son."  He tries to teach Willow all he can about soldiering and surviving in combat.

Willow in turn tries to teach his platoon mate Private Albert Wildman, a chronic screw-up, how to be a soldier. Wildman is later ordered to Vietnam, where he distinguishes himself as a heroic soldier and effective combat infantryman. He returns from Vietnam promoted to the rank of Sergeant and is a recipient of the Medal of Honor for heroism in combat. Sgt. Flanagan (Larry Fishburne), a fellow member of Sgt. Hazards platoon, receives his orders for Vietnam at the same time.

As he walks away, he receives a customary salute due to all MOH recipients from his old lieutenant, in the unusual situation of an officer saluting an enlisted person. Wildman smarts off at by asking "what the fuck are you looking at?", showing he had finally become an assertive soldier.  

The film ends with military honors being rendered at Willows graveside at Arlington and Hazard speaking to the mourners prior to the firing of the rifle salute and the playing of "Taps".
