 musical made in 1950 in film|1950.  The film was directed by Charles Walters and stars Judy Garland and Gene Kelly and features Eddie Bracken, Gloria DeHaven, Marjorie Main, and Phil Silvers. Nicholas Castle Sr was the choreographer. 

Judy Garland struggled with many personal problems during filming, and Summer Stock proved to be her last MGM movie and also her last pairing with Gene Kelly onscreen.  MGM terminated Garlands contract - by mutual agreement - in September 1950. 

==Plot==
Jane Falbury (Judy Garland) is a farm owner whose actress sister Abigail (Gloria DeHaven) arrives at the family farm with her theater troupe.  They need a place to rehearse, and Jane and her housekeeper Esme (Marjorie Main) reluctantly agree to let them use their barn. The actors and actresses, including the director Joe Ross (Gene Kelly), repay her hospitality by doing chores around the farm.  Although Joe is engaged to Abigail, he begins to fall in love with Jane after Abigail leaves him in an angry fit. Similarly, although Jane is engaged to Orville (Eddie Bracken), she falls in love with Joe.

==Highlights== Get Happy" performed by Judy Garland in a tuxedo jacket, black fedora, and black nylons to an arrangement by Skip Martin.  This sequence was choreographed by Charles Walters and filmed two months after the rest of the movie, after Garland sought the help of a hypnotist in Santa Barbara and lost 20 pounds. Garland performed the number perfectly in just a couple of takes, and the rest is history. According to New York Times critic Bosley Crowther: " Get Happy finds Miss Garland looking and performing her best."   

In another notable sequence, Kelly performs a solo dance in a darkened barn, using a newspaper and a creaky board as partners and props; the musical accompaniment reprises "You Wonderful You". The dance "turned out to be one of the breakthrough numbers" of his career. 

In the film, Garland and Kelly share what may be Garlands best dance duet on screen, the swinging "Portland Fancy" where a square dance turns into a heated challenge dance for the two stars.

== Production ==
Although Garland and Kelly were the stars originally announced by MGM in 1948 to appear in Summer Stock, in February 1949 the studio announced that Garland would be replaced by     Still, the filming of the movie was sometimes a struggle for Garland, who was facing many pressures in her personal life, aside from her heavy reliance on prescription medication. Green, p. 161  Soares, Emily.   TCM.com, accessed July 23, 2009     

Kelly himself was not the first choice for the role: the producer, Joe Pasternak, originally wanted Mickey Rooney for the part, but was prevailed on to go with Kelly because Rooney was no longer the box office draw he had once been. Busby Berkeley was originally slated to direct the film, but was replaced by Charles Walters before production began.  Both Kelly and Walters worked on the film as a favor to Garland, whose career needed a boost at the time. Later, after filming had begun, Pasternak asked Mayer if he should abandon the film because of Garlands erratic behavior &ndash; for example, she was supposed to appear in the "Heavenly Music" number to sing and dance with Kelly and Phil Silvers, but never showed up for the shoot &ndash; but studio head Louis B. Mayer insisted that Garland be given another chance,  saying "Judy Garland has made this studio a fortune in the good days, and the least we can do is to give her one more chance. If you stop production now, itll finish her."

 MGM was terminated through mutual agreement.   

Overall, Summer Stock took six months to film, and was a box-office success.

==Reception==
According to MGMs records, during the films initial release it earned $2,498,000 in the US and Canada and $859,000 overseas, resulting in a small $80,000 loss to the studio. 

==In popular culture==
The film, specifically the "Get Happy" sequence, has been referenced in many pop culture contexts.  Michael Jackson performed Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)|"Dangerous" in a way that paid tribute to the movie, most notably at the 1993 American Music Awards and the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. Jackson and his dancers wore suits, and a dancer stood in front of Jackson until the beginning of the song, just like in the movie, in which Judy is covered by a dancer at first. Some excerpts from the song can be heard in Jacksons performance.

British singer Duffy (singer)|Duffys "Rain on Your Parade" music video was also inspired by that sequence, and Duffy can be seen wearing an outfit similar to Garlands, and dancing against a white background along some male dancers dressed in suits.
 So You Think You Can Dance. She wore a similar outfit and danced alongside male dancers in suits in front of a match-painted background.
