Une femme coquette  (A Flirtatious Woman) (1955 in film|1955) was the first of four short fiction films made by French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard preceding his work in feature-length narrative film. 

The short film is based on the story Le Signe (The Signal), by Guy de Maupassant. It is a nine-minute story of a woman who  decides to copy the gesture she has seen a prostitute make to passing men. Then a young man, played by Roland Tolmatchoff, responds. In Maupassants original tale the scene takes place indoors, the woman having signaled from her window, but in Godards revision the characters meet by a bench on the Ile Rousseau in Geneva.
