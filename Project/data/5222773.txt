Condon gets the Tanaka Plan, a paper in which all the plans are described. The Japanese spies who follow him think that Ollie and Edith Miller (Wallace Ford and Rosemary DeCamp) are the ones who discovered the plan because they suddenly have a lot of money and are coming back to the USA. When Condon goes to the ship to bid them farewell, he finds Edith dead. He can only see a womans hand with a ring with a huge ruby. Back home, he finds Ollie, in terrible condition. He gets from Ollie the Tanaka plan.

Condon meets Iris Hilliard (Sylvia Sidney), half American and half Chinese. At first, he suspects her of being the lady in the ship, then he doesnt. They fall in love. She seems to be betraying him, especially when Condon sees the ring with the ruby in her hand.

At the end, it turns out shes been sent by a politician who wants peace and was present when the Tanaka plan was devised. Condon leaves his job after ten days. When hes about to leave Japan, he meets the politician and Iris in the harbor. The politician signs the document to prove its real. They are discovered by the Japanese army.
