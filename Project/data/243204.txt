 Penthouse Pets unsimulated sexual scenes filmed during post-production by Guccione and Giancarlo Lui.

Guccione hired screenwriter Gore Vidal to draft the films script and Tinto Brass to direct the film. Brass extensively altered Vidals original screenplay, leading Vidal to disavow the film. The final screenplay focuses on the idea that "absolute power corrupts absolutely". Brass and Guccione disagreed over Gucciones use of unsimulated sexual content, which Brass refused to film. Because the producers did not allow Brass to edit the film, they changed its tone and style significantly without consulting the director and added hardcore sex scenes not filmed by Brass, he also disavowed the film.

==Production==

===Development===
  was paid $200,000 to write the screenplay for Caligula;  ultimately, the film credited no official screenwriter, only that it was "adapted from a screenplay" by Vidal.]]
 The Longest The Day of the Locust, but it had never produced a film on its own.  The magazines founder Bob Guccione wanted to produce an explicit adult film within a feature film narrative that had high production values; he decided to produce a film about the rise and fall of the Roman emperor Caligula.    Development began under producer Franco Rossellini, the nephew of filmmaker Roberto Rossellini.  A screenplay was written by Lina Wertmüller, but Guccione rejected Wertmüllers script and paid Gore Vidal to write a new screenplay.    Vidals screenplay had a strong focus on homosexuality, leading Guccione to demand rewrites which toned down the homosexual content for wider audience appeal. Guccione was concerned that Vidals script contained several homosexual sex scenes and only one scene of heterosexual sex, which was between Caligula and his sister Drusilla.   Vidal was paid   for his screenplay, which was titled Gore Vidals Caligula. 

Elaborate sets were built by production designer Danilo Donati, who also designed the films costumes, jewelry, hair styles, wigs and makeup.  Several mainstream actors were cast, Guccione intending to make a film which he felt, like Citizen Kane, would be a landmark in cinematic history.    Guccione offered directing duties to John Huston and Lina Wertmüller, both of whom rejected the film.    After viewing scenes from the film Salon Kitty, Guccione agreed to have lunch with that films director Tinto Brass, believing Brass would be the ideal person to direct Caligula.  Brass had a reputation for being difficult to deal with on film sets but Guccione thought the films epic scope would "keep   in line" and that Brass understood the concept of the film enough to direct it.  Brass described Vidals screenplay as "the work of an aging arteriosclerotic" and agreed to direct only if he was allowed to rewrite Vidals screenplay.  Brass screenplay expanded the sexual content to include orgies, decorative phalluses, and much female nudity.  Guccione said Brass rewrites were done out of necessity to the films visual narrative and did not alter the dialogue or content. 

In an interview for Time (magazine)|Time magazine, Vidal said that in film production, directors were "parasites" and a films author was its screenwriter; in response, Brass demanded Vidals removal from the set and Guccione agreed.  Guccione considered film to be a "collective effort, involving the input of a great number of artists and craftsmen", and the director to be the leader of a "team effort".  Vidal filed a contractual dispute over the film because of Brass rewrites;  Guccione said Vidal had demanded 10% of the films profits, which Vidal said was not the case.  Vidal distanced himself from the production, calling Brass a "megalomaniac". Brass publicly stated, "If I ever really get mad at Gore Vidal, Ill publish his script".    Vidals name was removed from the films title; the credits were changed to state that the film was "adapted from a screenplay by Gore Vidal", crediting no official screenwriter.    Guccione said, "Gores work was basically done and Tintos work was about to begin". 

====Themes and significance====
   establishing the films theme that "absolute power corrupts absolutely". }}

The films primary theme is "absolute power corrupts absolutely".  Vidals script presented Caligula as a good man driven to madness by absolute power;  Brass screenplay envisioned Caligula as a "born monster".  In The Encyclopedia of Epic Films, author Djoymi Baker describes Brass screenplay as "an antiepic with an antihero, on a path of self-inflicted, antisocial descent".    Guccione said this final draft was more violent than sexual, stating, "I maintain the film is actually anti-erotic&nbsp;...&nbsp;in every one of its scenes youll find a mixture of gore or violence or some other rather ugly things". 

===Casting=== Maria Schneider Penthouse Pets as female extras in sexual scenes. 

=== Filming ===
  was cast  as Caligula, a "born monster"  who serves as the films antihero. ]]

Shooting began in 1976 in Rome.  McDowell got along well with Tinto Brass, while Peter OToole immediately disliked Brass. John Gielgud and Helen Mirren were indifferent to Brass; they focused on their own performances.  OToole had stopped drinking alcohol before filming, but Guccione described OToole as being "strung out on something" and said the actor was not sober during the entire filming schedule. 
 football match against the Italian team. He left the choreographer to pay for the meal, saying he had forgotten to bring enough money.  At the end of the production, McDowell gave his dresser a pendant bearing her name, but it was misspelled and she gave it back to him. McDowell offered her a cygnet ring, a prop from the film. She refused because it belonged to the production company. 

Brass decided not to focus much on Danilo Donatis elaborate sets, and intentionally kept the Penthouse Pets in the background during sex scenes. He focused instead on women whom Guccione considered to be unattractive.  Brass and Guccione disagreed about the films approach to sexual content; Guccione preferred unsimulated sexual content that Brass did not want to film.   

===Post-production===
  served as the films director, but disowned the film in post-production, and was credited only for "principal photography". ]]

Filming concluded on December 24, 1976.  Guccione said Brass shot enough film to "make the original version of Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur about 50 times over".   Brass started editing the film himself but was not allowed to continue after he had edited approximately the first hour of it. His rough-cut was disassembled afterwards and the film was edited by several editors, changing its tone and structure significantly by removing and re-arranging many scenes, using different takes, a slower editing style and music other than Brass intended.  

A few weeks after filming had concluded, Guccione and Giancarlo Lui returned to Rome with several Penthouse Pets. Guccione and Lui "hired a skeleton crew, snuck back into the studios at night, raided the prop room"  and shot hardcore sex scenes to edit into the film.   Brass ultimately disowned the film. 

Because the film was intended for release in English and much of the dialogue was recorded in Italian, the films soundtrack had to be Dubbing (filmmaking)|looped.    Peter OToole was reluctant to re-record his dialogue; kept away from the films producers until he re-recorded his dialogue in a Canadian recording studio.  The final production cost of the film was $17.5 million. 

===Soundtrack album=== Romeo and Juliet).  In November 1980, Guccione formed Penthouse Records to release a double album soundtrack to Caligula.    The album featured Nicolais score and two versions one in a disco style of a love theme titled "We Are One", which did not appear in the film.  

==Release==
  was cast as Caesonia, wife of Caligula. Mirren described the film as  an "irresistible mix of art and genitals".   ]]
 X which he considered to be "demeaning".    Instead, Guccione applied his own "Mature Audiences" rating to the film, instructing theater owners not to admit anyone under the age of 18.  The film premiered in the United States on February 1, 1980, at the Trans Lux East Theatre, which Guccione had rented exclusively to screen the film; he changed the theaters name to Penthouse East.   
 Brazilian Board of Censors approved the establishment of special theaters to screen In the Realm of the Senses and Caligula because they were international box office hits. 

Caligula grossed    at the box office, becoming the highest-grossing pornographic film ever produced independently.  The film was a financial success in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and Japan.  An 105-minute R-rated version without the explicit sexual material was released in 1981.   

===Legal issues===

In 1979, when Guccione tried to import the films footage into the U.S., customs officials seized it. Federal officials did not declare the film to be obscene.    When the film was released in New York City, the anti-pornography organization Morality in Media unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit against these federal officials. 

In Boston, Massachusetts, authorities seized the film.  Penthouse took legal action, partly because Guccione thought the legal challenges and moral controversies would provide "the kind of   coverage money can never buy".    Penthouse won the case when a Boston municipal court ruled that Caligula had passed the Miller test and was not obscene.  While the Boston judge said the film "lacked artistic and scientific value" because of its depiction of sex and considered it to "  to prurient interests", he said the films depiction of ancient Rome contained political values which enabled it to pass the Miller test in its depiction of corruption in ancient Rome, which dramatized the political theme that "absolute power corrupts absolutely".    A Madison, Wisconsin district attorney declined an anti-pornography crusaders request to prevent the release of Caligula on the basis that "the most offensive portions of the film are those explicitly depicting violent, and not sexual conduct, which is not in any way prohibited by the criminal law." 
 conservative morality reinforced by Ronald Reagans presidential victory, stating, "Apparently, these extremists have interpreted a change by administration to mean a clarion call for a mandate to shackle the publics mind again." 
The uncut film was granted a certificate by the British Board of Film Classification in 2008.
The film was banned in Australia, where it continues to be banned in its uncut form as of 2014. 

In 1981, Anneka Di Lorenzo, who played Messalina, sued Guccione, claiming sexual harassment. In 1990, after a protracted litigation, a New York state court awarded her $60,000 in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages. On appeal, court vacated the award because the punitive damages were determined to be unrecoverable. 

==Reception==

===Contemporary reviews===
  was cast as Tiberius in the film, a role originally offered to John Gielgud. ]]
 New York critic David Denby described the film as "an infinitely degraded version of Fellini Satyricon.   

===Retrospective reviews===
 Time Out London called it "a dreary shambles".  Positive criticism of the film came from Moviehole reviewer Clint Morris, who awarded it 3 stars out of 5, calling it "  classic in the coolest sense of the word".  New Times critic Gregory Weinkauf gave the film 3 out of 5, calling it "Kinda dumb and tacky, but at least its a real movie".  Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reviewer Philip Martin also gave the film 3 out of 5. 

Writers for The Hamilton Spectator and St. Louis Post-Dispatch said Caligula was one of the worst films theyd seen.   Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps said, "As a one-of-a-kind marriage of the historical epic and the porn film&nbsp;...&nbsp;Caligula deserves a look. But it might be better to let Gucciones savagely unpleasant folly fade into the century that spawned it". Keith Phipps
(April 23, 2002)  . The AV Club. Retrieved January 12, 2014. 

==Legacy== The Wolf of Wall Street. 

Caligula was released on DVD and Blu-Ray in an "Imperial Edition",  which featured the unrated theatrical release version and a new version featuring alternate sequencing from the original theatrical release and without the explicit sexual content shot by Guccione. This edition also includes audio commentaries featuring Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren, and interviews with the cast and crew.
