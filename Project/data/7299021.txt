==Origins== Citizen Dog. With his third film, Wisit was restrained by budgetary concerns from the stylizations of his first two films, but in doing so he was able to make it an homage to films of the 1930s and the stars of that era, including Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Thai pop culture influences come from illustrator Hem Vejakorn, who wrote a series of 10-satang graphic novel ghost stories in the 1930s and 40s. The reference was so striking that the Barom Khru Foundation, which claims to supervise Hems works, issued a statement warning Five Star Production to not violate the copyright of Hems work. However, Wisit said the film was not an adaptation of any of Hems works but was generally inspired by Hems style.
