}} 1975 United British film directed by Joseph Losey. It stars Michael Caine, Glenda Jackson, Helmut Berger, and marks the feature-length screen debut for Kate Nelligan. The screenplay was written by Tom Stoppard and Thomas Wiseman.

Caine plays a successful English novelist whose discontented wife, played by Jackson, decides to take a holiday to Germany in order to find herself. There she meets an ambiguous young man, played by Berger, in an elevator which initiates an often bizarre, but extremely mature examination of desire, responsibility and the nature of love.

The film was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but wasnt entered into the main competition.
