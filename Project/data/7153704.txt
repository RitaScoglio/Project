Back in his lab, Dr. Hess is studying Toulons formula, and desperate to meet and talk with him, he goes back to the old theater. Meanwhile, some friends from the puppet show, a boy named Peter Hertz and his father, find Andre and decide to live with him after Peters mother was arrested on charges of espionage.

While Six Shooter manages to kill the general, Müller shoots off one of the puppets arms beforehand. Peter goes back to Toulons old atelier to look for a replacement arm and is caught by Dr. Hess, who treats him kindly and gets him to take him to Toulon.

Dr. Hess finds and talks to Toulon, who tells him about the puppets secret, and the two become friends. But Peters father betrays Toulon by telling Major Kraus about his hideout in exchange for a pardon for his family. Kraus and his men storm the ruin, but the puppets fight back, enabling Toulon and Hess to escape. Kraus stops Peter and his father, demanding to know where Toulon is; Hertz fights against and is shot by Kraus. While searching the nearby houses, one of Kraus men is shot by Six Shooter; but when Hess approaches him, the soldier puts a knife into him before expiring.
