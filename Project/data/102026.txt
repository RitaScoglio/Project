==Plot== Mercyhurst College That Thing You Do". Jimmys girlfriend, Faye Dolan (Liv Tyler), is inspired by Guys reaction to the song (he exclaims, "Wonderful!") and names the group "The Oneders" (pronounced "Wonders"); a running gag has various people mispronouncing it as "Oh-need-ers".

 beach movie studio bassist, Scott "Wolfman" Pell (Larry Antonino) to join The Wonders for a live performance on a national television variety show. During the broadcast, the caption "Careful girls, hes engaged!" is superimposed beneath Jimmys close-up. Jimmy is upset by this, and after the show announces he has no intention of marrying Faye.  Heartbroken and fed up with his arrogant personality, Faye ends their relationship.

During a recording session the next day without Lenny (who eloped to Las Vegas with a Play-Tone secretary), Jimmy resists Whites plan to cover songs from the Play-Tone catalog. White explains that their Play-Tone contract specifies the content of the album: one original song per side, with the balance consisting of corporate-owned material, but the original songs must be "snappy", not ballads. Jimmy announces hes quitting the band and storms out of the studio. White tells Guy that the "The Wonders" are now in breach of contract with Play-Tone, but reassures a nervous Guy not to worry, that "no one is going to jail" and that this is not an uncommon occurrence and the record company will simply terminate their agreement and write them off as just another "one-hit wonder". Dejected, Guy remains in the recording studio and plays an impromptu jazz drum solo. He is overheard by the recording staff, who are impressed with his skills and offer to record the session. Guy refuses at first, but then is bolstered when his idol, jazz pianist Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs) suggests that they record a duet. Guy later tells Faye that Del thinks he has potential as a jazz musician. Faye tells Guy she plans on returning to Erie, and Guy takes the opportunity to declare his feelings for her.

The other Wonders had a regional hit record called "Say There" (b/w "Marilyn"; Colpix 699), released by Colpix Records in August 1963.  Little is known about these Wonders, except that they were probably from Ohio or Pennsylvania, as "Say There" hit the top 20 at WCOL in Columbus, Ohio, and made the Top 30 at KQV in Pittsburgh.  (Even more interestingly, there is a scene in the movie where a disc jockey at WCOL—with the stations call letters clearly visible on the wall behind him—is seen playing "That Thing You Do"!)

More camera time is also devoted to the romance between the bass player and one of the singers of the Chantrellines.  In the theatrical cut, this romance was depicted mainly as an unrequited crush on the part of the bass player; in the extended cut it is clearly shown that his efforts were successful.

At the end of the Extended Edition, rather than becoming a studio drummer on the recommendation of Del Paxton, Guy becomes a disc jockey for the jazz station KJZZ and records a documentary series of interviews with legendary jazz musicians.

===2007 DVD repackage re-release=== Bachelor Party and The Man with One Red Shoe in the Tom Hanks Triple Feature DVD anthology set. The actual DVD appears to be the original 2001 disc, with the featurette and music videos.
