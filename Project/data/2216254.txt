 1995 France|Franco-Cinema American List historical drama James Ivory, Ambassador of the United States to France before his Presidency and of his alleged relationship with British artist Maria Cosway and his relationship with his Slavery|slave, Sally Hemings. It was the first portrayal in film of Sally Hemings; at the time, mainstream historians disputed the relationship. 

Since a 1998 DNA study found a match between the male lines of Jefferson and Hemings descendants, the historic consensus has shifted to acknowledging that Jefferson likely had a nearly 40-year liaison with Hemings and was the father of all her children, four of whom survived and were freed.  , PBS Frontline, 2000, accessed March 10, 2012. Quote: "Now, the new scientific evidence has been correlated with the existing documentary record, and a consensus of historians and other experts who have examined the issue agree that the question has largely been answered: Thomas Jefferson fathered at least one of Sally Hemings children, and quite probably all six."  

==Plot== Versailles before King Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette and toward a more democratic form of government. Although deploring the poverty of the common people, he embraces the riches of French culture and civilization. It is his first time abroad, and he takes advantage of the opportunity to extend his knowledge of liberal arts and science while absorbing the refinements France has to offer.

A lonely widower, Jefferson develops a close friendship with Maria Cosway, a beautiful (and married) Anglo-Italian painter and musician. Although she becomes increasingly devoted to him, he is attached to his memory of his late wife, whom he promised that he would not remarry, and to his two younger daughters, especially the elder, possessive Patsy Jefferson|Patsy. He becomes attracted to Sally Hemings, the enslaved maid and companion of his younger daughter Polly. Three-quarters white in ancestry, she is his late wifes half-sister. Their father had taken Sallys slave mother as a concubine after he was widowed for the third time; Sally is the sixth of their children. Sallys enslaved brother James Hemings is also in Paris, learning to be a French chef for Jefferson at Monticello. When George Washington offers Jefferson the post of Secretary of State, he accepts and prepares to sail home with his family. But James, having enjoyed his freedom in Paris, is unwilling to return to the United States and urges Sally to remain with him. It is only when Jefferson promises he will give James and Sally, who is pregnant with Jeffersons child, their freedom that they consent to leave with him.

==Critical reception==
In her review in the New York Times, Janet Maslin called the film 
 "an extraordinary spectacle . . . the rare contemporary film thats both an entertainment and an education, despite some glaring misimpressions that are sure to spark heated debate . . . The biggest problem with   is at the basic editing level, with such abrupt jumps between diverse scenes that the films momentum remains choppy. Overshadowed by its own ambition and not-quite-ironic pageantry, Jefferson in Paris doesnt quite come to life . . . Casting Nick Nolte as a Founding Father may sound like this films riskiest choice, but in fact it makes solid sense. Beyond having the right physical stature for the imposing, sandy-haired Jefferson, Mr. Nolte captures the mans vigor and his stiff sense of propriety. He may not adapt effortlessly to the role of an intellectual giant, but his performance is thoroughly creditable . . . The film makers fare less successfully with Maria Cosway . . . Ms. Scacchi, the films big casting problem, makes her so bloodless and prettily artificial that the romance never seems real. Theres much more spice in Ms. Newtons captivating performance as Sally Hemings, even if she gives this teen-age slave girl the unexpected fiddle-dee-dee flirtatiousness of a Scarlett OHara."  

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, 
 "The film is lavishly produced and visually splendid, like all the Merchant-Ivory productions. But what is it about? Revolution? History? Slavery? Romance? No doubt a lot of research and speculation went into Jhabvalas screenplay, but I wish she had finally decided to jump one way or the other. The movie tells no clear story and has no clear ideas."  

In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers said,  A Room Howards End, The Remains of the Day), the team of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala drops the ball with this droopy, snail-paced prigs-in-wigs movie. It doesnt help that Nick Nolte is such a lox as Thomas Jefferson . . .   seems to think that playing an introspective man means impersonating a wax dummy."  

Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film "dull, sluggish and unfocused . . .   tries telling three or four stories at once, cant decide which is most important and winds up stubbing its well-manicured toes" and added,  sitcom star Brett Butler, Oscar nominations, Nolte makes a noble, sympathetic effort to humanize a historical figure, but never manages to look anything other than tight, corseted and out of his element."  

In Variety (magazine)|Variety, Todd McCarthy said the film 
 "touches upon much significant history, incident and emotion but, ironically, lacks the intrigue and drama of great fiction . . . as the opportunity for drama increases with the onset of Jeffersons affair with Sally and the buildup toward the Revolution, the narrative becomes more dispersed and murky. Things happen . . . but they dont weave and dovetail in the surprising, intricate and telling ways they can in first-class fiction, some of Merchant Ivorys recent films included . . . The strong points of director James Ivorys approach here are his attentiveness to wonderful detail . . . The downside is that Ivorys reticence makes it additionally tough for an emotionally remote figure like Jefferson to come alive onscreen."
