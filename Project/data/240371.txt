 Emmy and Golden Globe–winning television series of the same name starring Lorna Patterson, Eileen Brennan, Hal Williams, Lisa Raggio, Wendie Jo Sperber and Joel Brooks (it originally aired 1981–1983). Brennan and Williams had reprised their roles, that of Captain Doreen Lewis and Sergeant L.C. Ross, from the film for the television series.

==Remake==
In March 2010, Anna Faris was originally cast to portray Judy Benjamin in a remake of Private Benjamin from New Line Cinema, but in May 2014, it was confirmed that Rebel Wilson will portray Benjamin in the remake. Amy Talkington is in talks to write the script and Mark Gordon is set to produce.

The new take will set the story in contemporary times with modern wars as the backdrop. Insiders say the studio does not want to poke fun at the people in the service or take political potshots, but rather focus on the empowerment elements and build on the fish-out-of-water comedy.
