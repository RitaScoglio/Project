Rampage is a 2006 documentary by Australian war artist, George Gittoes. It is a sequel to his previous documentary, Soundtrack to War.    The film follows the lives of three brothers living in Miamis notorious brown sub ghettos. 

Hip hop performers Swizz Beatz, Fat Joe and DJ Kaleb appear in the film.

==Background==
Elliot Lovett, whom Gittoes befriended during the filming of Soundtrack to War, told him of his family and his younger brother Marcus, who he insisted was a gifted poet-rapper. Gittoes made the trip to Miami to meet the family, with the intention of creating a Stateside sequel to Soundtrack to War, continuing the theme of music in a dangerous place.
