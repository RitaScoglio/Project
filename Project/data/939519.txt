 G (or the local equivalent) in most countries. It was the first fully digital feature length film produced for a large screen format.

==Plot== extraterrestrial humanoid species, the Glegoliths, wandering through space in search of a new world. Encountering an unknown planet (which turns out to be Earth), the Glegolith leader (Cyrillus) sends two "manned" probes to the surface to determine if it is suitable for colonisation.

The scouts in the probes think they have arrived at a great city, but in fact they have arrived at a new amusement park that is not yet open to the public. They proceed to explore four amusement rides (later made into separate shorts):
* Arctic Adventure (motion simulator ride in a freezing environment); Arabian Nights themed dungeon);
* Kid Coaster (a roller coaster set in a gigantic simulation of a childs bedroom); and
* Aqua Adventure (an underwater themed motion simulator ride, complete with animatronic sharks).

At each ride the Glegolith scouts become variously excited, frightened, frozen or violently ill, but end up having a lot of fun. On seeing this, Cyrillus decides that the new planet "was too much fun" and would destroy the fabric of his society, and orders his scouts to withdraw. The alien visitors depart Earth without actually making contact with humans.
