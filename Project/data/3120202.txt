==Plot==
   
 Queen of RAF Chinook helicopters, follow the BFG to the giants homeland, where the giants are taken prisoner. The only one to escape is the Fleshlumpeater, who immediately attacks the BFG and later pursues Sophie; but after a long chase he is subdued by the nightmare caught earlier. The tethered giants are then each transported by helicopter to London, where they are sealed in a pit and forced to eat Snozzcumbers for the rest of their lives. Contrary to the books ending, the BFG stays in Giant Country instead of moving to England, and Sophie becomes his assistant at the distribution of dreams.
