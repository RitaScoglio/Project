Frank Falenczyk (Ben Kingsley) is a hit man for his Polish mob family in Buffalo, New York.

He is forced to accept a job at a mortuary, and go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, where he confesses his job, explaining that he wants to be free of his drinking problem because its affecting his ability to kill effectively. He falls in love with Laurel Pearson (Téa Leoni), a quirky client he meets at the funeral home. Meanwhile, an upstart Irish mob threatens the family snow-plowing business.
