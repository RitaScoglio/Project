}} Nancy Allen, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) as a superhuman cyborg law enforcer known as "RoboCop (character)|RoboCop".
 video games, comic book adaptations/crossovers. The film was produced for a relatively modest $13 million. 

==Plot== financial ruin Omni Consumer Products (OCP), allowing them to run and control the underfunded police force in exchange for giving OCP the freedom to demolish the poor run-down sections of Detroit and construct a high-end utopia called "Delta City," to be managed by OCP as an independent city-state free of the United States. However, OCP must clean the city of crime in order for the plan to be put in effect, much to the dismay of the police officers. Considering other options of law enforcement, OCP senior president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) offers the prototype RoboCop (franchise)#ED-209|ED-209 enforcement Droid (robot)|droid, but when it accidentally kills a board member during a demonstration, the OCP chairman, nicknamed "The Old Man" (Dan OHerlihy), decides to go with the experimental cyborg design titled "RoboCop" as suggested by the younger Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer).

Meanwhile, police officer Alex Murphy ( , protect the innocent, and uphold the law, as well as a fourth classified directive that Morton doesnt know of. He single-handedly and efficiently cleans Detroit of crime, and Morton is given praise for his success. This draws Jones anger with Mortons plan working perfectly while Joness ED-209 is ridiculed. Lewis eventually discovers that RoboCop is really Murphy. Murphy experiences past events from his life and, at one point, returns to his former home, finding out that his wife and son have long since moved away, thinking that Murphy has died.

While Morton shares cocaine with two models, Boddicker arrives, forces the models to leave, and wounds Morton. He then shows him the message from Jones, explaining that he hired the killer to kill him for not going through OCP properly. Boddicker then places a grenade on the table and abandons the crippled executive, leaving him to die.

Murphy tracks down Boddicker to a cocaine factory and threatens to kill him, but Boddicker admits his affiliation with Jones, and is able to verbally trigger RoboCops law-abiding directive. Murphy finds he cannot kill Boddicker and arrests him instead. He approaches Jones at OCP headquarters and attempts to make an arrest, but Jones reveals he planted the hidden Directive 4 that prevents Murphy from taking any action against an OCP executive. Jones explains his larger goal of taking over OCP, and confesses to Mortons murder. Although he orders his personal ED-209 to kill Murphy, Lewis is able to help Murphy escape and takes him to the same steel mill at which he was murdered to repair himself and recover. There, Lewis learns that much of his personality still exists intact.

Meanwhile, the police force, under further duress by OCP and fearing their replacement by the RoboCop program, finally goes on strike and crime runs rampant. Boddicker regroups his gang to take out Murphy using Anti-tank warfare#Anti-tank guns|anti-tank rifles and a tracking device provided by Jones. They converge on the steel mill, but Murphy and Lewis are able to fend off the attack and kill the gang, although Lewis is wounded. Murphy assures her that medical help is on the way, and heads back to OCP, easily destroying the ED-209 guarding Jones using one of the anti-tank rifles. Robocop then proceeds to head towards the top of the tower.

He arrives at the board room where Jones is offering his ED-209 to replace the Detroit Police Department, which is still out on strike. After announcing hes programmed not to act on any OCP senior officials, Murphy replays a recording of Jones explaining that he murdered Bob Morton, which reveals his duplicity to the board. Jones grabs the Old Man hostage and threatens to kill him unless hes given a helicopter. Realizing Robocop is unable to act due to the restrictions of Directive 4, The Old Man immediately fires Jones from being an OCP official. Now that Directive 4 no longer applies to Jones, Robocop kills Jones by shooting him out of the tower window. The Old Man thanks RoboCop and asks for his name, to which RoboCop replies, "Murphy."

===Inspiration and script===
RoboCop was written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner.  Neumeier stated that he first got the idea of RoboCop when he walked with a friend past a poster for Blade Runner. He asked his friend what the film was about and his friend replied, "Its about a cop hunting robots".  For him, this sparked the idea about a robot cop. Allegedly, while the two were attempting to pitch the screenplay to Hollywood executives, they were accidentally stranded at an airplane terminal with a high-ranking movie executive for several hours. Here, they were able to speak to him about the project, and thus began the series of events which eventually gave rise to RoboCop the movie.

 Repo Man Kenneth Johnson, The Incredible Hulk, said that he was offered the chance to direct, but turned it down when he was not allowed to change aspects of the script that he considered to be "mean-spirited, ugly and ultra-violent." 
 Rom  political left, Starship Troopers fascist movie. Jon Davison referred to the films message as "fascism for liberals" a politically liberal film done in the most violent way possible.

===Casting=== hockey gear and designed to be large and bulky. Weller won the role both because Verhoeven felt that he could adequately convey pathos with his lower face, and because Weller was especially lithe and could more easily move inside the suit than a bigger actor. 

Stephanie Zimbalist, who at the time was one of the stars of the television series Remington Steele, was originally cast as Anne Lewis. NBC had canceled Remington Steele in 1986, leaving the stars free to accept other roles, subject to options for further episodes on their contracts. However, an upsurge of interest in the show saw the network exercise the options, which meant that Zimbalist was then forced to withdraw from RoboCop, to be replaced by Nancy Allen. 

In the DVD directors commentary, Verhoeven explained that he intentionally chose to cast Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox against type by making them the central villains. Cox was an actor who, until then, was primarily known for "nice-guy" roles, such as fatherly figures.  Similarly, Smith had been cast as more intellectual characters.  Verhoeven chose to outfit Smiths character Clarence Boddicker in rimless glasses because of their intellectual association, creating a disparity in the character that Verhoeven found akin to the similarly bespectacled Heinrich Himmler. 

===Filming===
Filming began on August 6, 1986, and wrapped on October 20, 1986. The scenes depicting Murphys death were not filmed until the following January (1987), some months after principal shooting had ceased. Many of the urban settings of RoboCop were filmed either in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Houston or Dallas, Texas.    The futuristic appearances of the Dallas buildings, such as the Reunion Tower, are visible in the background during the car chase. The front of Dallas City Hall was used as the exterior for the fictional OCP Headquarters, combined with extensive matte paintings to make the building appear taller. The steel mill scenes were filmed at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steels Monessen Works, in the Pittsburgh suburb of Monessen, Pennsylvania.

Peter Weller had prepared extensively for the role using a padded costume (supposedly, development of the actual RoboCop suit was three weeks behind schedule).  By the time shooting was underway and the costume had arrived on set, however, Weller discovered he was almost unable to move in it and needed additional training to become accustomed to it. Weller later revealed to Roger Ebert that during filming, he was losing three pounds a day due to sweat loss while wearing the RoboCop suit in 100&nbsp;°F (38&nbsp;°C) temperatures.  Wellers personal assistant, Todd Trotter, was responsible for keeping the actor cool in between takes with electric fans and, when available, large ducts connected to free-standing air conditioning units. The suit later had a fan built into it. 

Monte Hellman acted as second unit director after Verhoeven began to fall behind schedule.    He directed several action scenes. 
 Ford Taurus was used as the police cruiser in the movie, due to its then-futuristic design. As of May 2012, RoboCops Taurus is on display at the Branson Auto Museum in Branson, Missouri. http://bransontrilakesnews.com/news_free/article_05bad386-9edc-11e1-95c6-0019bb2963f4.html Holy automobiles, Batman 

Bob Mortons home was filmed in a home near Dallas featured in the show Beyond 2000 in 1987.   

===RoboCop design=== The Thing. A budget of up to one million dollars was allotted to the completion of the suit, making it the most expensive item on the set. A total of six suits were made: three intact and three showing damage.
 The 8 Man and the first Metal Hero Space Sheriff Gavan from Toei Company|Toei, Rob, Paul Verhoeven, and Edward Neumeier came up with the concept of the suit being more of an outer shell, with very little of the actors actual face being visible. Bottin explained the basis of the design:
 Its meant to look very speedy and aerodynamic. All the lines are measured to go on a slant forward, forward, forward! All the lines were geometric, and complement every shape on the body from all angles. When Verhoeven came on the project, he requested numerous design changes, additions to the suit which looked more like machine than man-like. Ive never done so many conceptional drawings for a director in my entire life changing it, and changing it, and changing it!    

However, the design ended up bearing a closer resemblance to Bottins original design:
 RoboCop looks the way he does because thats the way a mans body works! Although we went through fifty different variations, developing his character, everything came back to man-like. Its definitely a guy in the suit, which doesnt belittle it any.  

The suit itself was attached to the actor in sections. To wear the helmet, Peter Weller wore a bald cap that allowed the helmet to be removed easily. After almost 10 months of preparation, the RoboCop suit was completed based on life casts from Peter Weller and Bottins six-foot clay models. The suits color was supposed to be bright blue; however, it was given a more grayish tint to make it look more metallic and produce less glare on the camera when it was being filmed. 

Peter Weller hired Moni Yakim, the head of the Movement Department at Juilliard, to help create an appropriate way for him to move his body while wearing the RoboCop suit.    He and Moni had envisioned RoboCop moving like a snake, dancing around and moving very elusively. The suit, however, proved to be too heavy and cumbersome. Instead, at the suggestion of Moni, it was decided that they would slow down RoboCops movements in order to make them more appealing and plausible. Filming stopped for three days, allowing Peter and Paul Verhoeven to discuss new movements for the suit. 

The original gun for RoboCop was a Desert Eagle, but this was deemed too small. A Beretta 93R was heavily modified by Ray Williams of Freshour Machine, Texas City, Texas, who extended the gun barrel to make it look bigger and more proportional to RoboCops hand. The gun holster itself was a standalone piece that was not integrated into the suit. Off-screen technicians would operate the device on cue by pulling cables that would force the holster to open up and allow the gun to be placed inside. 

===Visual effects=== Craig Davies,    who also built the full size models, and animated by Phil Tippett, a veteran stop-motion animator.  As one of the setpieces of the movie, the ED-209s look and animated sequences were under the close supervision of director Paul Verhoeven, who sometimes acted out the robots movements himself. ED-209 was voiced by producer Jon Davison. Davies and Tippett would go on to collaborate on many more projects.
 Rick Bakers work on The Incredible Melting Man, and who dubbed the RoboCop effects "the Melting Man" as an homage to the production. 

Chiodo Brothers Productions fabricated and animated the dinosaur puppet in the 6000 SUX commercial. The dinosaur itself was animated by Don Waller, who also had a cameo in the same sequence, reacting to the rampaging creature in a tight close-up.

The soundtrack score for the movie was composed by Basil Poledouris, who used both synthesized and orchestral music as a mirror to the man-versus-machine theme of the movie. The score alternates brass-heavy material, including the RoboCop theme and ED-209s theme, with more introverted pieces for strings, such as during RoboCops homecoming scene. The music was performed by the Sinfonia of London, conducted by Howard Blake and Tony Britten. The soundtrack initially was released by Varèse Sarabande, and has been reissued and remastered several times since.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film received positive reviews from critics  and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1987.       of American culture". 

Roger Ebert praised the film, calling RoboCop "a thriller with a difference," praising the way it puts the audience off-guard, and calling it a thriller not easily categorized with splashes of other genres added. Ebert praised Weller for his performance and his ability to elicit sympathy despite the layers of makeup and  , believed the films anti-corporate message "has more trouble emerging from Mr. Verhoevens sizzling battles than poor Murphy does from his robosuit."  

Feminist author Susan Faludi called RoboCop one of "an endless stream of war and action movies" in which "women are reduced to mute and incidental characters or banished altogether."  Rene Denfeld disagreed with Faludis characterization of the film, calling it her "favorite blow-em-up movie," citing Officer Lewis as an example of an "independent and smart police officer."  In the commentary track of the Special Edition DVD release, the Director explained that he intentionally depicted Officer Lewis as "gender neutral" thus her gender is hidden during her introductory scene, a physical fight with a male in the police station, and the choice of the character having short hair.

 

===Accolades=== Robert Wald). It won the Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing (Stephen Hunter Flick and John Pospisil).    In 2007, Entertainment Weekly named it the #14 greatest action movie of all time.  In 2008, the film was selected by Empire (magazine)|Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, placing at #404.  It made a similar list, The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made, by The New York Times. 
 100 Series 100 Years…100 Ten Top Ten", a list of the best 10 films in 10 "classic" American film genres. RoboCop was a candidate in the science fiction category.  At its release, British director Ken Russell said that this was the best science fiction film since Fritz Langs Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis (1927).

===Themes and analysis=== big corporations will take care of us and…how they wont."   

Two of the primary themes explored by RoboCop are the media and human nature. On the Criterion Edition DVD commentary track, executive producer Jon Davison and writer Edward Neumeier both relate the film to the decay of American industry from the 1970s through the early 1980s, with the abandoned "Rust Belt style" factories that RoboCop and Clarence Boddickers gang use as hideouts reflecting this concern. Massive unemployment is prevalent, being reported frequently on the news, as are poverty and the crime that results from economic hardship.

Director Paul Verhoeven, known for his heavy use of   figure. This is represented in Murphys horrific death, his resurrected return as RoboCop, and the scene at the steel mill in which RoboCop is seen walking ankle-deep in water, creating the illusion of him walking on water.

  and The Six Million Dollar Man in this respect. Leader wrote of RoboCop:  The RoboCop is a family man who is destroyed by thugs, then rebuilt as a robot by science. His son always insists, before the transformation, that his human father perform the gun spinning trick he sees on TV. When the robot can finally do this properly, he is no longer just a male biological body: he is a body plus machinery, a body which includes within it the symbolic circuitry of science. Old heroes had bits of metal outside them (knights), but modern heroes have bits of metal inside them. To be a man today thus involves this kind of real incorporation of symbolic properties.    

Philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek wrote that: 
 RoboCop, a futuristic story about a policeman shot to death and then revived after all parts of his body have been replaced by artificial substitutes, introduces a more tragic note: the hero who finds himself literally "between two deaths" clinically dead and at the same time provided with a new, mechanical body—starts to remember fragments of his previous, "human" life and thus undergoes a process of resubjectivication, changing gradually back from pure incarnated drive to a being of desire. (...)  f there is a phenomenon that fully deserves to be called the "fundamental fantasy of contemporary mass culture," it is this fantasy of the return of the living dead: the fantasy of a person who does not want to stay dead but returns again and again to pose a threat to the living.    

The depiction of Murphys struggles in reasserting his humanity also deals with themes of identity. This is even touched upon in the cyborgs construction. On the Robocop: 20th Anniversary Collectors Edition DVD, Paul Sammon states:
 Rob Bottin and  Paul Verhoeven, and Ed Neumeier had all come up with a concept that there would be such a potential for psychological disruption. Even if you had supposedly wiped someones memories and emotions theyd still might have some kind of residual humanity where, if theyd looked at themselves as a complete robot with no relation to their past organic form, theyd completely freak out and have a psychotic breakdown. So the idea was that surgeons had literally skinned off Alex Murphys face and then placed it on the cyborg. So its not like they transplanted his head, they just took his face off and laid it on the cyborg, and that was to give him his own little sense of identity. RoboCop 20th Anniversary Edition DVD  

==Novelization==
The film novelization, written by Ed Naha, was released on June 1, 1987. The novel differed in several ways from the film by following one of the earlier drafts of the screenplay. It expanded on Murphys struggle with being part man and part machine, and his memories. It also included more "humanized" dialogue from RoboCop, as opposed to the minimal, cold dialogue heard in the film. 

==Legacy==

===Franchise===
  comic book adaptations/crossovers.

===Statue===
In February 2011, a humorous ploy asked Detroit Mayor Dave Bing if there was to be a RoboCop statue in his "New Detroit" proposal, which was planned to turn Detroit back into a prosperous city again. When Bing said there was no such plan, and word of this reached the Internet, several fundraising events raised enough money for the statue, which would be built at the Imagination Station.  There were plans to unveil the RoboCop statue in spring of 2014. 

===Remake===
 
MGM and Sony produced a remake of RoboCop, directed by José Padilha. Joel Kinnaman plays the role of Alex Murphy and Gary Oldman is "Norton", a new character, "the scientist who creates RoboCop and finds himself torn between the ideals of the machine trying to rediscover its humanity and the callous needs of a corporation."  Samuel L. Jackson plays a powerful and charismatic media mogul, while Michael Keaton plays the CEO of Omnicorp after Hugh Laurie dropped out of the project in August 2012.  Actress Abbie Cornish plays Murphys wife and Watchmen (film)|Watchmen star Jackie Earle Haley plays Maddox, the man who gives RoboCop his military training.  The film was finally released in the United States on February 12, 2014.
