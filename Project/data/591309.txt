== Plot == Mafia bar and throwing dice, and is admonished harshly by Lorenzo when he discovers it. Lorenzo speaks severely to Sonny, returns the money, and warns him to keep away from Calogero.

Eight years later in 1968, Calogero (now played by Lillo Brancato, Jr.) has grown into a young man and has secretly been visiting Sonny regularly without his fathers knowledge. Calogero is also part of a gang of local Italian boys he grew up around, even though Sonny tries to persuade Calogero to keep away from them and focus more on his schoolwork. Later on, Calogero meets an African American girl named Jane Williams (Taral Hicks), and is smitten with her. Despite the high level of tension and dislike between Italians and African Americans, particularly amongst Calogeros friends, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from both his father and Sonny; the latter lending Calogero his car. Around the same time, Calogeros friends beat up black cyclists passing through their neighborhood; Calogero is powerless to stop them but does his best to defend a young man named Willie, who turns out to be Janes brother. Willie, however, mistakes Calogero for one of the assailants and accuses him of beating him when Calogero and Jane meet for their date. In the ensuing argument, Calogero loses his temper at Willies lack of gratitude and responds by addressing him with a racial slur, but then instantly regrets it. Heartbroken, Jane and Willie walk back to the car and leave Calogero.
 egg the Italian boys usual spot in retaliation for the previous beating, and in revenge, Calogeros friends make a plan to strike back using Molotov cocktails. They take an unwilling Calogero with them but during the ride, Sonny stops the car and orders Calogero out. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that Willie had since admitted that the boy who beat him up wasnt Calogero, but Willie was angry and tried to hurt Calogero by lying about him. Jane and Calogero make amends, but Calogero suddenly remembers his friends plans to assault Janes neighborhood, and the two rush to stop them. However, upon arriving, Calogero and Jane see the boys car destroyed. During the assault, someone had thrown one of the Molotov cocktails back into Italian boys car through the window, igniting the remaining bottles, causing a crash and explosion, and killing all of Calogeros friends. 

Calogero rushes to the bar to thank Sonny for saving his life, but the bar is crowded, and an unnamed assailant (who Calogero later learns was the son of the man who Sonny killed in the beginning in the film) shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. A funeral is then held for Sonny, where countless people come to pay their respects. Once they are all gone, a lone man, Carmine (Joe Pesci), visits the funeral, claiming that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not appear to know Carmine, but remembers him when he sees a scar on his forehead: the murder Sonny had committed outside Calogeros home eight years ago had been in defense of Carmine, who was being beaten by the assailant with a baseball bat. Carmine tells Calogero that he will be taking care of the neighborhood for the time being; he promises Calogero help should he ever need anything, and leaves just as Calogeros father arrives, surprisingly, to pay his respects to Sonny, and thank him for saving his son. Lorenzo says that he had never hated Sonny, but merely resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero makes peace with his father, and the two walk home as Calogero narrates the life lessons he learned from the two men.
