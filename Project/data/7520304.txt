==Synopsis==
Barcelona is the scenario for eleven entwined stories sharing the same characters. The movie deals with a variety of intimate relationships, portraying characters who have to experience intense emotions which cannot be materialised in caresses. Connections explored include several different family and romantic relationships across different genders, ages and generations.

A recurring theme is the irony of how difficult communication
can be, even when there is close contact. Partial expression, instincts vs. emotions and physical communication all play a part.
