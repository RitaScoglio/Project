 satirization of administration    made in mockumentary style.   

Allen plays Harvey Wallinger, a thinly disguised version of Henry Kissinger.    The short was produced as a television special for PBS and was scheduled to air in February 1972, but it was pulled from the schedule shortly before the airdate. Reportedly, PBS officials feared losing its government support and decided not to air it.     Allen, who previously had sworn off doing television work, cited this as an example of why he should "stick to movies".  The special never aired and can now be viewed in The Paley Center for Media. 
 leading ladies, Louise Lasser and Diane Keaton, make appearances, as does the Richard Nixon-lookalike Richard M. Dixon. The fictional characters are interspersed with newsreel footage of Hubert Humphrey, Spiro Agnew, and Nixon in embarrassing public moments. Allen would later explore this style again in Zelig.
