==Production==
  Mexican film, Amores perros by Alejandro González Iñárritu, but eventually only the idea of hyperlink cinema was common in both films. However, Mani Ratnam revealed that the film was closer to Akira Kurosawas 1950 Japanese film Rashomon (film)|Rashomon as both films dealt with a cause-effect and a third-view. 
 Madhavan was Vikram was Srikanth and Sriman and Krishna and Suchitra, a singer and radio jockey, also were chosen to play the roles of student leaders in the film.
 Simran was Kannan mentoring her progress. It was also reported that actress Nadhiya had signed the film and would make a comeback to films after a ten year sabbatical, but did not eventually form a part of the final cast. 

The director initially opted against using songs in the film, but wanted to create an album with A. R. Rahman for the project. However after the songs were recorded, Mani Ratnam had a change of heart and chose to include them. For the art direction in the film, Sabu Cyril studied each character in depth, giving them a distinct colour, mood and background to suit their temperament. For Michaels house in the film, Cyril followed the arrangement in his own house and used some his own photographs for decorations. He also expressed that he had great difficulty in re-creating the streets of Kolkata for the Hindi version of the film in Chennai.  G. Ramesh was selected to be the hairdresser for the three lead actors in the film. 

The scene filmed at Napier Bridge in Chennai was canned in early December 2003, causing severe traffic and congestion in the area.  Mani Ratnam began the Tamil version after Vivek Oberoi suffered an injury during the making of Yuva, giving him time to extract more out his actors in the Tamil version.  Production work for the film began in September 2003, with the technical crew who were mostly from the Tamil film industry including the production house were part of the  Hindi version and were retained for the Tamil scenes.  The Tamil version finished subsequently much earlier than the Hindi version. 

==Reviews==
Aaytha Ezhuthu received an A certificate from CBFC due to some glamour content and strong theme. 
Indiaglitz wrote: "Worth watching".  Nowrunning rated 4 out of 5.  Sify wrote: "Aayitha Ezhuthu is a bold and daring move by Mani Ratnam to change the staid style of our commercial cinema".  Hindu wrote: "Every frame of Madras Talkies "Aayudha Ezhuthu" bears the Mani Ratnam stamp and thats what matters. If silence and secrecy can stoke up interest, it has. And again, if the stature of a director can hype up a project, it has".
