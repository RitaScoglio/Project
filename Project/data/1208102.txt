==Plot==
In ancient America, Helam witnesses the star heralding the birth of Christ, and 33 years later he faithfully awaits the promised coming of the Messiah despite persecution for this belief. Helams son, Jacob, is interested more in the ways of the world, including the lovely Laneah, and when his abilities as an artisan bring an offer to work for the wealthy and powerful Kohor, he jumps at the chance and is estranged from his fathers house.

Kohor is plotting to destabilize the existing government and become the absolute ruler.

In contrast, Amaron, a holy man, preaches to people of Christ, whose ministry and miracles are concurrently taking place across the seas in The Holy Land. As Jacob becomes more immersed in the secular life of Kohors house, Laneah becomes more interested in the humble faith he is forsaking. Her conversion to Christ, and the death of Amaron at the hand of Kohors men, brings Jacob to his senses, but he knows of Kohors plans and is imprisoned when he refuses to join the conspiracy.
In Jerusalem, Jesus is crucified and the far away city of Zarahemla is plunged into darkness and destruction as Helam pushes through the crowds and ruins to help his son.
All seems hopeless when he is blinded and thinks that he will not see the Messiah. However, the Messiah restores his sight when he comes to minister to the people of the Americas.
