Neovoxer is an experimental non-dialogue film directed, written, edited, and composed by Michael Pope between the years of 1997 and 2004 in collaboration with hundreds of artists, performers, and musicians.  The film was shot on a variety of media ranging from 35mm film to digitally manipulated video. Live screenings of the film often feature preshow performances from body painted living statues, musicians and art installations. Workshop performances and screening events have taken place in Boston and New York.  Nevoxer earned Michael Pope an award from the Tanne Foundation in 2001.  In 2004, Neovoxer travelled to the Czech Republic to work with local musicians as a part of the Festival of Czech Films Finale Plzeň 2004.
