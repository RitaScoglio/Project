==Production==
===Casting===
Garland had asked to star in a straight dramatic role after growing tired of the strenuous schedules of musical films. Although the studio was hesitant, the producer, Arthur Freed, eventually approached Garland with the script for The Clock after buying the rights to the short unpublished story by Paula and Paul Gallico.

===Filming===
Fred Zinnemann was initially hired to direct the picture. After about a month, he was removed at the request of Garland as there was a lack of chemistry between the two and early footage was disappointing. When Freed asked who Garland wanted to direct the film, she answered, "Vincente Minnelli". Minnelli had just directed Garland the previous year in Meet Me in St. Louis, which was a tremendous success. Moreover, she and Minnelli had become romantically involved during the principal photography of Meet Me In St. Louis. During production of The Clock, they rekindled their romance, and were engaged by the end of shooting. Minnelli discarded footage shot by Zinnemann and reshaped the film. He revised some scenes, tightened up the script, and incorporated New York City into the films setting as a third character. As with Meet Me in St. Louis, he supervised adjustments to  Garlands costumes, make-up, and hair.
 
Both producer Arthur Freed and Roger Edens have a cameo in this film. Near the beginning, Freed lights Walkers cigarette and then gives him the lighter. Edens, a music arranger and close friend to Garland, plays piano in a restaurant. Screenwriter Robert Nathan appears uncredited smoking a pipe.
 addicted to prescription drugs given by the studio to control her weight and pep her up. Just prior to filming the The Clock, Walker learned his wife, Jennifer Jones, was having an affair with film producer David O. Selznick and wanted a divorce. Walker began to spiral downward. During filming, Garland would often find him drunk in a Los Angeles bar and then sober him up throughout the night so he could appear before cameras the next day.

===Locations===
According to Robert Osborne in his introduction of this film on Turner Classic Movies, because World War II had not yet ended, filming on location was not considered cost effective or easy.  Though the film was shot entirely on the MGM lot in Culver City, Minnelli managed to make New York City believable, even duplicating Penn Station at a reported cost of $66,000.

===The clocks=== Hotel Astor, Beaux Arts style in 1904, the Astor was demolished in 1967 and replaced by One Astor Plaza, a tall office-tower structure.

When Joe and Alice are accidentally separated, they find each other again at Pennsylvania Station near the information desk.  Another clock is depicted hanging there, closely resembling the one prominently displayed in Grand Central Station.

==Critical reception==
Many audiences who were surprised and disappointed to find that Garland did not sing in the film, were nevertheless impressed by her performance. It would be sixteen years, however, before she would make another dramatic film, 1961s Judgment at Nuremberg.

Released on May 25, 1945, The Clock made a respectable profit but it was not as successful as Meet Me in St. Louis, released the previous year. Because World War II was ending, The Clock  s story was not a popular choice among film-goers who wanted to put the war behind them. Nevertheless, it was well received by critics who favorably noted Garlands transformation into a mature actress.

The New York Times ; "A tender and refreshingly simple romantic drama. The atmosphere of the big town has seldom been conveyed more realistically upon the screen   the kind of picture that leaves one with a warm feeling toward his fellow man, especially towards the young folks who today are trying to crowd a lifetime of happiness into a few fleeting hours."

The New York Daily News ; "The sweetest, most tender comedy-drama yet produced about a soldier and a girl. Judy Garland and Robert Walker are perfectly cast as the modest, sincere girl and the shy, sincere boy."  

===Box Office===
According to MGM records the film earned $2,173,000 in the US and Canada and $610,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $217,000 - far less profitable than Garlands recent musicals but still a strong showing. 

==Home media==
Released on VHS in the early 1990s, the film went out of print for several years until a limited colorized version of the film was released. Warner Brothers then released it on DVD in February 2007.
