==Plot==
In the 19th century, an English couple and their infant son escape a burning ship, ending up on land near uncharted rainforests off the coast of Africa. The couple craft themselves a treehouse from their ships wreckage, but are subsequently killed by Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor, a rogue leopardess. Kala (Tarzan)|Kala, a female gorilla who recently lost her own child to Sabor, hears the cries of the orphaned human infant and finds him in the ruined treehouse. Though she is attacked by Sabor, Kala and the baby manage to escape. Kala takes the baby back to the gorilla troop to raise as her own, an act of which her mate, Kerchak, disapproves. Kala raises the human child, naming him Tarzan. Years later, as a child, he begins befriending the other gorillas in the troop and other animals, including the young female gorilla Terk, and the paranoid male elephant Tantor. One day, he accidentally triggers a stampede of elephants who mistakes him for a piranha. Tarzan blamed for the incident runs off, believing he finds himself unable to keep up with them, so he takes great efforts to improve himself as promised to Kala. As a young man, Tarzan is able to kill Sabor with his crude spear and protect the troop, gaining Kerchaks reluctant respect.

The gorilla troops peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of human explorers from England, consisting of Professor Porter, his daughter Jane, and their hunter-guide Clayton. Curious, Tarzan, swings off to investigate. He spots Jane accidentally being separated from the group only to be chased by a pack of  , and he and Jane begin to fall in love. However, they are having a hard time convincing Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas, due to Tarzans fear for their safety from the threat of Kerchak.

When the explorers boat returns to retrieve them, Clayton makes Tarzan believe that Jane will stay with him forever if he reveals the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the party to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to avoid having him attack the humans. Porter and Jane are excited to mingle with the gorillas, but Kerchak returns and threatens to kill them. Tarzan is forced to hold Kerchak at bay while the humans escape, and decides to leave the troop himself, now humiliated by his actions. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse she found him in, and shows him his true past. She tells him that she wants him to be happy whatever he decided. When Tarzan returns to the ship with Jane and Porter, they are ambushed by Clayton and his band of stowaway pirates, who reveal themselves to be poachers, intending to capture gorillas to be sold. After being detained in the brig, 
Tarzan flees with the help of his friends, and he races back to the gorillas homeground. By nightfall, the gorillas are ambushed by Clayton and his men, who are stopped by the arrival of Tarzan and his friends. Clayton mortally wounds Kerchak and then engages Tarzan in a fierce battle across the vine-covered tree tops. Although Tarzan spares his life, Clayton is finally killed, when he falls with a vine around his neck, hanging him. Kerchak, in his dying breath, finally accepts Tarzan as his own and names him as leader of the gorilla troop. The rest of the gorillas are freed after scaring away the rest of Claytons men.

The next day, as Porter and Jane prepare to leave for England, Tarzan reveals that he will stay with his gorilla troop. As the boat leaves shore, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with the man she loves, and Jane jumps overboard to return to shore; Porter shortly follows her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and his family and embark on their new life together.

==Production==

===Development===
Disneys Tarzan was the first Tarzan film to be animated.  Thomas Schumacher, the President of Feature Animation, expressed surprise that there werent any previous attempts to animate a Tarzan film, saying "Here is a book that cries out to be animated. Yet were the first filmmakers to have ever taken Tarzan from page to screen and presented the character as Burroughs intended."  He noted that in animated form, Tarzan is able to connect to the animals on a deeper level than he can in live action versions. 
 Walt Disney Studios during his post-production work on A Goofy Movie.    As Lima was reading Tarzan of the Apes, he began to visualize the theme of two hands being held up against each other.    That image became an important symbol of the relationships between characters in the film, and a metaphor of Tarzans search for identity. "I was looking for something that would underscore Tarzans sense of being alike, yet different from his ape family," Lima said, "The image of touching hands was first conceived as an idea for how Tarzan realizes he and Jane are physically the same."    Following his two-month study of the book, Lima approached his friend, Chris Buck, who had just wrapped up work as a supervising animator on Pocahontas (film)|Pocahontas, to ask if he would be interested in serving as co-director. Buck was initially skeptical, but accepted after hearing Limas ideas for the film. 

===Writing=== The Hunchback treatment in January 1995. For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.  In this departure from Burroughs novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his daughter, Jane. In addition to this, Kerchak was re-characterized from a savage silverback into the protector of the gorilla tribe. 

In January 1997, husband-and-wife screenwriting duo Bob Tzudiker and Noni White were hired to help refocus and add humor to the script as a way to balance the emotional weight of the film.  Comedy writer Dave Reynolds was also brought on to write humorous dialogue for the film.  "I was initially hired on for six weeks of rewriting and punch-up," Reynolds said, "A year and a half later, I finished. Either they liked my work, or I was very bad at time management."  One challenge the writers faced was how Tarzan should learn about his past. "When Kala takes Tarzan back to the tree house, she is essentially telling him that he was adopted," Bonnie Arnold, the producer for Tarzan, said, "This is necessitated by him encountering humans and recognizing he is one of them."  As a way to explore the feelings in that scene, Arnold brought in adoptive parents to talk with the story team. 

===Animation===
The animators were split into two teams, one in Paris and one in Burbank. The 6000 mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. Glen Keane was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a "scene machine" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios. 

Keane was inspired to make Tarzan "surf" through the trees because of his sons interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a "surfer dude", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the "Son of Man" sequence. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzans movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor on anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles. 

To prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a 2 week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.  In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the films home video release. 

To create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, Tarzans production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as Deep Canvas (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).   This technique allows artists to produce  , particularly large panoramic shots of the island and several action sequences. Expanded to support moving objects as part of the background, Deep Canvas was used to create about 75% of the environments in Disneys next major animated action film, Treasure Planet.

===Music===
 
The songs for the film were written and performed by singer Phil Collins. Tarzan was dubbed in thirty-five languages—the most for any Disney movie at the time,    and Collins recorded his songs in French, Italian, German, and Spanish for the dubbed versions of the films soundtrack.   According to Collins, most of the songs he wrote for Tarzan came from improvisation sessions and his reactions while reading the treatment.  3 of the songs he wrote, "Son of Man," "Trashin the Camp," and "Strangers Like Me," were based on his initial impressions after he read the source material. The other 2 songs were "Youll Be in My Heart," a lullaby sung to Tarzan by Kala (voiced by Glenn Close), and "Two Worlds," a song Collins wrote to serve as the anthem for Tarzan. 
 musical of the same name. Mancina and Collins worked closely to create music that would compliment the films setting, and used many obscure instruments from Mancinas personal collection in the score.  "The idea of score and song arrangement came together as one entity, as Phil and I worked in tandem to create whats heard in the film," Mancina said. 

Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave the soundtrack a B-, stating that it was awkwardly split between Collinss songs and the traditional score, was burdened by too many alternate versions of the tracks, and in some instances bore similarities to The Lion King and Star Wars. 

==Reception==
Tarzan currently holds a rating of 88% on  , the film has a score of 79 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

Entertainment Weekly compared the films advancement in visual effects to that of The Matrix, stating that it had "the neatest computer-generated background work since Keanu Reeves did the backstroke in slow motion." They elaborate by describing how the characters moved seamlessly through the backgrounds themselves, giving the film a unique three-dimensional feel that far surpassed the quality of previous live-action attempts.  Roger Ebert had similar comments about the film, describing it as representing "another attempt by Disney to push the envelope of animation," with scenes that "move through space with a freedom undreamed of in older animated films, and unattainable by any live-action process."
