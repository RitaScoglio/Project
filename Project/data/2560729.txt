==Plot==

Erik (Rolf Lassgård), a Stockholm police officer reunites with his relatives upon the death of his abusive father in Norrbotten, where his brother Leif (Lennart Jähkel) resides as an adult, having been traumatized by the abuse to which level he gave up his dreams of becoming an opera singer, and instead stayed in the small community where he was convinced he belonged. This revealed-to-be tragedy is a substory to the main plot. 
Being shocked after killing a man in duty, Erik has been transferred to the local field office. He soon starts to suspect his brothers friends, led by the half-Finnish Tomme (Jarmo Mäkinen) to be the culprit pursuers of massive illegal hunt of reindeer and moose. At first he is mostly distressed with the local polices unwillingness to deal with the problem, but as events unfold he discovers illegal weapons in Tommes car outside a pub, and decides to intervene. The latter is close to assaulting Erik when he is saved by his brother, who is himself partly stigmatized by the others for the cause. It is later revealed that Leif in fact leads the illegal hunting, but out of love for his brother wants to keep him unaware and out of trouble.  mentally retarded childhood friend of Erik, the five men decide to keep silent of the matter instead of going to the police, as Leif would face life imprisonment|life.
 Filipina girlfriend forcing her to sexual intercourse by violence. It is later revealed that she returned to the Philippines. Erik, meanwhile, tries to have Tommes wife betray her husband and tell him something, but she refuses. Upon the arrival of a female attorney detective from Stockholm (Helena Bergström), the body of the Russian woman is found. With information from Ove, the police find the body of the male Russian, contaminated with the bullet. Erik tells Ove to stay inside and keep his door locked, but once discovering the source, Leif and the others arrive to Oves house and take him out in the woods. Erik and prosecutor Anna arrive too late, as the gang has "accidentally" shot Ove, who remarkably tried to defend himself by shooting Leif in the chest upon discovering that the latter had emptied his rifle. 
Though distressed by the obviousness of the crime, but seemingly unable to prove that the hunters killed Ove deliberately, Erik is forced to pursue a hunt on the rifle of which the Russian was shot. In a final stand-off he is fired at and nearly killed by Tomme, but manages to assault the latter using an iron bar, prosecuting Tomme for the murder. As he is unable (and perhaps unwilling) to have his brother convicted, Erik decides to return to Stockholm, and after having a final conversation with Leif he drives away in his car (having received his part for the inheritance from his dead father) but suddenly the house explodes ablaze, revealing that Leif had committed suicide. Erik returns to Stockholm, trying to pursue another life than that his father and his brother had attempted.
