== Plot == his grandfather, the infamous mad scientist. To disassociate himself from his forebears, Frederick insists that his surname is pronounced "Fronkensteen."
 estate in Igor (Marty whenever spoken causes horses to rear up and neigh madly in fright. Though his family legacy has brought shame and ridicule, Frederick becomes increasingly intrigued about his grandfathers work after discovering the secret entrance to his grandfathers laboratory. Upon reading his grandfathers private journals, Frederick is so captivated that he decides to resume his grandfathers experiments in re-animating the dead. He and Igor steal the corpse of a recently executed criminal, and Frederick sets to work experimenting on the large corpse. Matters go awry, however, when Igor is sent to steal the brain of a deceased revered historian, Hans Delbrück; startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbrucks brain. Taking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled "Abnormal Brain! Do Not Use", which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.

Soon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is elevated on a platform to the roof of the laboratory during a lightning storm. Eventually, electrical charges bring the creature to life. The creature makes its first halting steps; but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, he attacks Frederick and must be sedated. Upon being asked whose brain was obtained, Igor confesses that he supplied "Abby Normals" (A. B. Normal, abnormal) brain.

The townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfathers work. Most concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a one-armed police official whose German accent is so thick even his own countrymen cannot understand him. Kemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster. Upon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers that Frau Blücher is setting the creature free. After she reveals the monsters love of violin music and her own romantic relationship with Fredericks grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.

While roaming the countryside, the Monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman). Frederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monsters homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, "My name is Frankenstein!"

Frederick offers the sight of "The Creature" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests. The demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number "Puttin on the Ritz," complete with top hats and Tailcoat|tails. The routine ends disastrously, however, when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police.

The monster escapes, then kidnaps and rapes Elizabeth when she arrives unexpectedly for a visit. Elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstuker or Schwanzstück).
 The Bride Of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure—the monsters Schwanzstücker.

== Production ==

=== Origins ===
In a 2010 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mel Brooks discussed how the film came about: 
 the son of, the cousin of, the brother-in-law, we dont need another Frankenstein. His idea was very simple: What if the grandson of Dr. Frankenstein wanted nothing to do with the family whatsoever. He was ashamed of those wackos. I said, "Thats funny." 

Unlike his previous and subsequent films, Brooks did not appear onscreen as himself in Young Frankenstein, though he recorded several voice parts and portrayed a German villager in one short scene. In 2012, Brooks explained why:
:"I wasn’t allowed to be in it. That was the deal Gene Wilder had. He  , “If you’re not in it, I’ll do it.”     He  , “You have a way of breaking the fourth wall, whether you want to or not. I just want to keep it. I don’t want too much to be, you know, a wink at the audience. I love the script.” He wrote the script with me. That was the deal. So I wasn’t in it, and he did it." 

=== Filming ===

Mel Brooks wanted at least $2.3 million dedicated to the budget, whereas Columbia Pictures decided that $1.7 million had to be enough. Brooks instead went to 20th Century Fox, for distribution after they agreed to a higher budget.

While shooting, the cast ad-libbed several jokes used in the film. Cloris Leachman improvised a scene in which Frau Blücher offers "varm milk" and Ovaltine to Dr. Frankenstein, while Marty Feldman surreptitiously moved his characters hump from shoulder to shoulder until someone noticed it, and the gag was added to the film ("Didnt you used to have that on the other side?", "What hump?").

In one of the scenes of a village assembly, one of the authority figures says that they already know what Frankenstein is up to based on five previous experiences. On the DVD commentary track, Mel Brooks says this is a reference to the first five Universal films. In the Gene Wilder DVD interview, he says the film is based on Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), Son of Frankenstein (1939) and The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942).

== Soundtrack ==
ABC Records released the soundtrack on LP in 1974. On April 29, 1997, One Way Records reissued it on CD. There are pieces of dialogue by the actors as well as background and incidental music on the disc. The LP and disc are now out of print and command a very high price on Internet auction sites when available.
