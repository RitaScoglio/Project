Ben Hur is a 2003  , by Lew Wallace. It is the fourth film adaptation of the novel.
 1959 version. This 2003 version was Hestons last film.

==Synopsis== Balthazar waiting in the desert for the two other wise men for a journey to Bethlehem. The story of Judah Ben-Hur|Ben-Hur begins 30 years after the birth of Christ.

In contrast to the 1925 and 1959 versions, the face of Jesus is shown and his words are heard in this film.
 Messala is different from the 1959 film. Appearing lame, he approaches Ben-Hur for forgiveness, and joins Ben-Hurs family and Balthazar to witness the passion of Jesus. Ben-Hur gives water to Jesus on the way to Calvary. As Jesus dies, Ben-Hur and his family, with Balthazar, Messala, and  Esther (character)|Esther, clasp their hands in prayer. Miracles occur when Jesus heals Ben-Hurs family of leprosy, and enables Messala to walk again. He comes near the cross thanking Jesus for the miracle.

At the films end, Mary Magdalene sees Jesus emerge from the tomb and he ascends into heaven, giving the promise to the apostles to preach the gospel. Ben-Hur, now married to Esther, shares with his children his story and faith in Jesus.
