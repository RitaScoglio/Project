 action Thriller thriller film Brian Tyler composed the films score.

==Plot== severe battle stress from his time in the Kosovo War.
 AWOL because the Army now seeks to kill him before he can divulge information regarding off-the-books assignments hes carried out.

This narrative is confirmed when the local authorities as well as the FBI are circumvented by nameless government agents who arrive and present documentation allowing them to take possession of the prisoner.

While being transported by his former special handlers in the back of a nondescript-looking panel truck, Hallam manages to kill all the operatives and escape. Alerted to the incident, Bonham and the FBI team arrive at the scene and the chase begins again. The team tracks Hallam across the city and back into the wilderness but Hallam consistently evades them. Realizing that the FBIs tactics arent working, Bonham strikes out on his own and the search quickly becomes a personal contest between teacher and student, finally culminating in another desperate battle amongst the waterfalls of a national forest.

Bonham kills his own student by stabbing him in the chest with a knife. The FBI arrives too late, and Bonham walks away without saying a word. Bonham returns to British Columbia, where he starts to burn letters that were sent to him from Hallam, explaining that he had been obsessed to find his teacher.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The overall critical reaction to the movie was negative. It scored a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 146 reviews.   Many reviewers noted striking similarities to First Blood. Rolling Stone called it "Just a Rambo rehash,"  while Rex Reed of the New York Observer called it a "Ludicrous, plotless, ho-hum tale of lurid confrontation." 
The UK magazine, Total Film said the film was "scarcely exciting to watch." 

However, the film also received praise from other high profile critics, particularly for the fact it kept the special effects and stunts restrained. For example, Roger Ebert said, "Weve seen so many fancy high-tech computer-assisted fight scenes in recent movies that we assume the fighters can fly. They live in a world of gravity-free speed-up. Not so with Friedkins characters."    He reviewed the film on his own site and scored it 3 and 1/2 stars out of four. 
Time Out London was also positive saying, "Friedkins lean, mean thriller shows itself more interested in process than context, subtlety and character development pared away in favour of headlong momentum and crunching set pieces."
