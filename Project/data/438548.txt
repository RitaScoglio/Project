Blackadder: Back & Forth is a 1999 sci-fi comedy film based on the BBC mock-historical sit-com Blackadder that marks the end of the Blackadder saga. It was commissioned especially for showing in the specially built "SkyScape" cinema, erected southeast of the Millennium Dome on the Greenwich peninsula in South London.  The film follows Lord Edmund Blackadder and his idiotic servant, Baldrick, on a time travel adventure that brings the characters into contact with several figures significant to British history.  

In a 1999 interview, Richard Curtis described it as "an irreverent trek through British history – a time travel adventure story consisting entirely of people who are either rude or stupid."   , Hugh Laurie, Tim McInnerny and Miranda Richardson. 

==Production==

On his way back to the machine, Blackadder literally runs into William Shakespeare (Colin Firth). After giving the Bard a ballpoint pen and receiving his autograph, Blackadder punches him in the face, remarking, "That is for every schoolboy and schoolgirl for the next four hundred years!" Blackadder tells Shakespeare that his plays are nothing but people "in stupid tights... talking total crap (disambiguation)|crap," then kicks him in vengeance for Kenneth Branaghs "Hamlet (1996 film)|endless, uncut, four-hour version of Hamlet". Stunned, Shakespeare asks, "Whos Ken Branagh?" Blackadder smugly retorts, "Ill tell him you said that and, I think, hell be very hurt!"
