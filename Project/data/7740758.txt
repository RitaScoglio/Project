==Reception==
Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, "But even as the premise of The Plague continues to titillate and intrigue, the film can’t quite deliver on its promise, rendering it slightly entertaining and ultimately forgettable."   Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "Clive Barker may have in some way produced this mess and lent his name to it, but rest assured there’s nothing Barker-esque about it. All thats here is a giant missed opportunity which — pardon the really bad, yet fitting pun — you should avoid like the plague."   Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote that it does not live up the premise, instead "devolving into yet another (and very stale) zombie-type chase thriller".   David Johnson of DVD Verdict wrote, "The Plague is an inscrutable movie that starts out strong, but loses forward momentum, eventually grinding to an awkward halt."
