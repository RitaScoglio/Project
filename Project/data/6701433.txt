==Plot==
Iyarkai is a familiar love triangle that plays out in unfamiliar surroundings. It revolves around a girl and the two men who love her but by placing the happenings in a port town of Rameswaram, the director manages to give the proceedings a fresh feeling.

Marudhu (Shaam), an orphan and sailor, lands in Rameswaram and decides to give up his sailing life and settle down there. He develops a liking for Nancy (Radhika), who sells fruits and other items to sailors on ships that have arrived at the port. But Nancy still holds a candle for the captain of a ship that docked there three years ago. The captain (Arun Vijay) had promised her that he would return in a year but three years later, Nancy has still not given up hope.

She is in a dilemma whether to choose the captain or Marudhu and finally selects the former leaving mixed feelings of joy and sorrow.
