 The Food of the Gods. The story revolves mostly around a chemical substance called "Goo", which causes giant growth in living things, and what happens after a gang of rebellious youngsters get their hands on it. The cast was mostly teens, or young actors playing teens, and The Beau Brummels and Freddy Cannon make musical guest appearances.

The movie was a low-budget exploitation film and not a huge hit (released mostly to drive-in theater|drive-ins as part of a double bill), but had some notable use of special effects and undoubted sex appeal, and went on to become a cult classic. The movie proved far more successful years later, when released on home video.

==Plot==
Village of the Giants takes place in fictional Hainesville, California. After crashing their car into a roadblock during a rainstorm, a group of partying, big-city teenagers (Fred, Pete, Rick, Harry, and their girlfriends Merrie, Elsa, Georgette and Jean) first indulge in a vigorous, playful mud-wrestling fight, then hike their way into town. Fred remembers meeting a girl from Hainesville named Nancy, and they decide to look her up.

Nancy, meanwhile, is with her boyfriend Mike, while her younger brother "Genius" plays with his chemistry set in the basement. Genius accidentally creates a substance he names "Goo", that, when consumed, causes animals, including a pair of ducks, to grow to gigantic size.

The out-of-town teens break into the local theater and clean up from the rain, then go to a nearby club where The Beau Brummels are performing. Shortly, the giant ducks turn up, followed by Mike and Nancy. Everyone is astounded by the size of the ducks, wondering how they got so big. Mike explains that its a secret, but following a suggestion made by their friends Horsey and Red, they host a picnic in the town square the next day, roasting the ducks and feeding everybody. Freddy Cannon is featured singing a song in this scene.

Fred and his friends also see potential in whatever made the ducks grow, but their minds are purely on profit. They scheme to learn the secret, and are ultimately successful, escaping with a sample. Back at the theater, the gang argues over what to do with the Goo, now that they have it. Feeling peer pressure, Fred slices up the Goo, giving everyone a piece each, which they consume a moment later. As the Goo takes effect, they each grow to over thirty feet tall, ripping right out of their clothes. At first everyone is shocked and regretful, but realizing their newfound power at their new size, the gang decide to take over the town.

Overnight, the giants decide to isolate Hainesville from the rest of the world. They rip out the telephone lines, overturn broadcasting antennas, and block the remaining roads out of town. When the sheriff and Mike arrive to deal with them, they discover that the giants have no plans to leave &ndash; and are literally holding the sheriffs daughter, as "insurance" that they wont have any trouble. While the towns adults seem paralyzed, the teens decide to fight back. An attempt to capture Fred results in Nancy being taken hostage.
 ether – having noticed the giants only leave one guard on the hostages, Mike and Horsey plot to subdue that guard, recover the guns, and free Nancy and the sheriffs daughter.

Having led the giants outside the theater, Mike plays David to Freds Goliath, to distract them while Horsey and the others effect the rescue. Genius newest attempt at Goo results in an antidote. He rides over to the square on a bicycle with a pail full of the fuming antidote. As the giants breathe in the fumes, they all return to normal. Mike cold-cocks the surprised Fred, and promptly runs him and his friends, looking silly in their now-oversized clothes, out of town.

However, as Fred and the others reach their car, they meet a travelling band of midgets who have heard about the "goo" and its effects and are heading into the town to investigate the substance.

==Production notes==
===Director=== Beginning of The Cyclops The Food of the Gods (1976).

The film was made by Gordons newly formed Berkeley Productions. It was to be the first of a three-year 12-picture deal between Berkeley and Joseph E. Levines Embassy Productions. Some of these were to be for TV, others for films.  The next two films were meant to be The Creatures of Dr Freak and Horror House Wolper to Film Africa Saga
Briggs, Andrew. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File)   04 Sep 1965: B6.  but neither were made.

===Casting===
The cast features a number of children of established Hollywood actors: Beau Bridges (son of Lloyd Bridges), Ron Howard (son of Rance Howard), Tisha Sterling (daughter of Ann Sothern), Toni Basil (daughter of Lois Basil) and Tim Rooney (son of Mickey Rooney). Producers Get the Action
Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File)   27 May 1965: C8. 
Debi Storm completed her role as the sheriffs daughter in just three days. Vicki London, who played Georgette, is absent from the screen for most of the giant scenes in the movie.  Robert Random and Joy Harmon each also appeared in episodes of Gidget (TV series)|Gidget, which debuted in the fall of 1965.
 Breakfast at Tiffanys (1961).

Tommy Kirk made the film after his arrest for drug possession. He later said he wasnt "too embarrassed" about the film. "Its kind of a crazy movie but the production values are pretty good and it sort of holds together. I could have done without the dancing ducks, though." 

Beau Bridges has one of his earliest roles as the unofficial leader of the teenagers who turn into giants. Coburn in What Did...?
Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File)   22 May 1965: B5.  He later recalled:
 When I did it, I was about 18 or 19, and I took it all quite seriously. I thought it was my chance to really be a spokesperson for my generation, you know? I had that long speech when I’m in the theater, and I’ve eaten this goo… I address the police chief of the town about the young people, the teenagers, that he says are losing control, and I speak out about freedom and everything. I took it so seriously, and I think I even rewrote my lines. Now, though, it’s, uh, a little embarrassing.  

===Original script===
Alan Caillous original script called for the sheriffs deputy (played by Rance Howard) to be stepped on by the giants. If the scene was ever filmed, it did not make the final edit, and no known footage of it exists.

===Locations and props===
Most of the outdoor scenes were filmed on the Columbia Pictures backlot, where portions of I Dream of Jeannie and The Partridge Family were also made. The lot is now owned by Warner Brothers. The scene where the giants convene outside the Hainesville theater was shot at the Courthouse Square lot at Universal Studios, where Back to the Future and Gremlins were later made.
The films goo was a simple mixture of angel food cake with pink-colored dye. The beer the "teenagers" are drinking at the beginning of the film is Blatz (beer)|Blatz, and the Teen magazine Joy Harmon reads during one part of the film is an actual issue, from the summer of 1965.  The tiny yellow custom hotrod (with the surfboard) that is used in the street scene to tie up Beau Bridges feet is The Surfite, designed by Ed "Big Daddy" Roth.

==Reception==
The Los Angeles Times said the "best things" about the film were the "special effects and photographic trickery ... after, of course, those endless views of healthy young torsos gyrating to the rhythms of the Beau Brummells or Freddy Cannon ... Alan Caillous script keeps the action fast and the dancing swinging." Village of Giants Very Big With Teens
Harford, Margaret. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File)   17 Dec 1965: e23. 

==Legacy==
In January 1994, Village of the Giants was featured as an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (episode 523). The episode was dedicated in memoriam to the recently deceased Frank Zappa.
