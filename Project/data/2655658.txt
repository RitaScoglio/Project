According to Oscar Levant, the plays title was derived from a Graffiti|graffito. 

==Plot== German domestic American cabaret singer Ginnie—as he searches for something better than he has.  He becomes rich and successful, and is elected to public office.  Only in his old age does he realize that what he always had—the love of his wife— was more than enough to sustain him. Evie dies, however, and writing his memoirs, Littlechap comes to terms with his own selfishness.  At the moment of his death, however, he watches his second daughter give birth to a son. When the boy nearly dies, Littlechap intervenes, and allows Death to take him instead.  He then mimes his own birth, beginning the cycle once again.
