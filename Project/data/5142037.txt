==Critical Reception==
The film received 3 stars out of 4 from the critic Alain Spira in Paris Match: "Marrakchi  depicts, in an original way, the young jet set of her country.   Hypocritical religion, arranged marriages, the Judeo-Arab rivalry, nothing is spared. But Marock is also a great cry of love for her country with its generous spirit and matchless style  for living."
