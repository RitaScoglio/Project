==Synopsis==
18-year-old Danny dAngelo, an alumnus of Benjamin Franklin High School in New York City, lives in an apartment with his mother and a charitable sister named Marie.  One day in July, he discovers they have inherited the Hotel Majestic, a long-closed facility in Bethany, Pennsylvania â€” and along with it, $8,000 in unpaid taxes (equal to $ }} today).    Dannys great-aunt Theresa once owned the place, but died before she could pay them off.  Unknown to them, a firm called Pritchard Chemicals is willing to acquire the property for its Fox River project, and turn it into a chemical waste dump.
 Boy Scouts, and successfully sell a lot of mint cookies to office workers.

Danny eventually makes Marie proud, not only with his earnings, but with a bundle of food supplies for a few needy neighbors.  Soon, he and his friends travel to Hawley on a decorated van, but the worn-down state of the Majestic catches them off-guard.  Rockefeller G. Harding, a residing hermit, gives them a tour that leaves the newcomers more appalled.  They begin to renovate the building and transform it into "The New Hotel Majestic...For Kids Only", promising "MTV in every room" once it re-opens.  But several of the townsfolk express their displeasure over what could happen to their town, and even take measures to keep Danny and friends out of their lives.

Meanwhile, Rockefeller suggests that Danny recruit stockholders to manage the hotel.  In doing so, Danny scouts the New York streets and hires many of his friends for that purpose.  Arriving in Hawley, the stockholders of Majestic Enterprises are as dismayed as Danny, Spikes and Silk previously were; the luxury they expected of the Majestic is nowhere in sight.  Instead, they are put to the task of fixing up the place within a month, after which inspection will take place.
