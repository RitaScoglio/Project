}} Shakespearean As play of Orlando De Boys, Romola Garai as Celia, Adrian Lester as Oliver De Boys, Alfred Molina as Touchstone (As You Like It)|Touchstone, Kevin Kline as Jaques, Janet McTeer as Audrey, and Brian Blessed as Duke Frederick and his brother Duke Senior.

Branagh moved the plays setting from medieval France to a late 19th century European colony in Japan after the Meiji Restoration. Branagh filmed it at Shepperton Film Studios and at the never-before-filmed gardens of Wakehurst Place. The film is a production of The Shakespeare Film Company, financed by HBO Films. It is Kenneth Branaghs first Shakespearean film shot in a Super 35 format.

See the Plot for the original As You Like It|Play.

==The Japanese reimagination==
Although the film was not made in Japan, Branagh reimagines the play there during the late nineteenth century, where many English traders lived. Branagh portrays Duke Seniors court as a British outpost whose ruler admires Japanese culture:  although most of the inhabitants wear European clothes, Duke Senior and his brother both wear Japanese clothes. Each British lady at the outpost covers her face modestly with a fan, and styles her hair reminiscently Japanese. When the banished characters travel to the   actors play the de Boys brothers, Orlando and Oliver. When Orlando fights not merely a wrestler, it is indeed a sumo wrestler.

Branagh invented a prologue in which ninja warriors attack Duke Seniors family as it attends a performance of Kabuki theatre. Branaghs prologue defines exactly the moment that Duke Frederick usurps his brothers kingdom, a moment that Shakespeare himself did not.

The epilogue deliberately interrupts the closing credits with Rosalinds speech, as the camera pans to see Rosalinds actor, Bryce Dallas Howard, walking to her dressing trailer on the films location.

Despite the cultural transposition, Shakespeares language and the names of his characters remain the same. The film closely follows Shakespeares plot. Some critics praised the setting. Others found it useless and irrelevant, since few of the characters are Japanese.

==Reception==
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes awards the film a 36% score, based primarily on the British reviews, which soundly panned it.  However, another aggregator, Metacritic, awards it 75%, as it is based largely on the American reviews, which gave it favourable notices.  
 Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, and Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet; he blasted the film, saying that he could barely get through it, and that, by giving it such an unusual setting, Branagh seemed to be trying to "apologize" to the viewing audience for the fact that As You Like It was a Shakespeare film.  Critic Virginia Heffernan writing for The New York Times was also negative pointing out that movie reduces the role of main character Rosalind; "Mr. Branagh has teased out every manly rivalry and preserved every hey-nonny-nonny of the kooks in the Forest of Arden, but slashed passages of the repartee that defines Rosalind." 

===Awards=== SAG award (Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries) for his performance in this film, although strictly speaking, the film is not a made-for-television movie; made-for-TV films do not play theatrically in other countries before being released directly to TV in the US; they do so afterwards. This makes Kline the first actor to win a major US award for acting in one of Branaghs Shakespeare films, though some of his others have won critics awards for the acting in them.

Likewise, Bryce Dallas Howard received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Made-for-TV Film or Miniseries, but did not win the award.
