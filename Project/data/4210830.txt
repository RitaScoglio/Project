The Majorettes is relatively noteworthy for its midway plot shift during which the protagonist, Jeff Halloway (Kevin Kindlin) arms himself and besieges a biker gang (metaphorically "going Rambo" on them) to avenge crimes that they, not the slasher, committed. Such a twist is atypical of slasher films, which tend to follow a strict plot pattern.
