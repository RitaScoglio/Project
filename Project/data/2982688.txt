}} mutant Wolverine Victor Creed. Team X, and the bonding of Wolverines skeleton with the indestructible metal adamantium during the Weapon X program.

The film was mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand, with Canada also serving as a location. Production and post-production were troubled, with delays due to the weather and Jackmans other commitments, an incomplete screenplay that was still being written in Los Angeles while principal photography rolled in Australia, conflicts arising between director Hood and Foxs executives, and an unfinished workprint being leaked on the Internet one month before the films debut.
 The Wolverine was released in 2013.

==Plot== Team X, Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, but the groups disregard for human life causes James to leave.
 Kayla Silverfox. Meanwhile, with Team X disbanded, Bradley has also taken up a different life at a carnival in Springfield, until Victor comes to visit him. Back in Canada, Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the teams members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kaylas bloodied body in the forest, Logan realizes Victor is responsible, and finds him at a local bar. Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased. Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where a kind elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning, and tries to kill Logan. But Logan brings down Zeros helicopter, killing him, and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.

Logan locates John and Fred at a boxing club. Fred explains that Victor is still working for Stryker, hunting down mutants (among them teenager  ".
 Professor Charles lost his memory; he sees Kaylas body but doesnt recognize her, and leaves the island.

In a mid-credits scene, a weary Stryker is being detained for questioning by some MPs in connection to the death of his superior, General Munson (whom Stryker did in fact kill earlier after Munsons declaration of his intent to shut down the formers project).

 Victor Creed / Sabretooth:
:Logans half-brother and fellow soldier, who would later become his nemesis  , who played him in X-Men (film)|X-Men, had hoped to reprise the role.  Jackman worked with Schreiber before, in the 2001 romantic comedy Kate & Leopold and described him as having a competitive streak necessary to portray Sabretooth. They egged each other on on set to perform more and more stunts. Schreiber put on   of muscle for the part,  and described Sabretooth as the most monstrous role he ever played. As a child, he loved the Wolverine comics because of their unique "urban sensibility". Schreiber had studied to be a fight choreographer and wanted to be a dancer like Jackman, so he enjoyed working out their fight scenes.  Victor Creed

Describing her role, Collins said "I had to play off all the guys and their testosterone-heavy abilities. But I learned that the female powers of persuasion easily trump fangs and knives and guns."  Michelle Monaghan turned down the role because of scheduling conflicts, despite her enthusiasm to work with Jackman. 
 Fred J. Dukes / The Blob:
:A mutant with a nearly indestructible layer of skin. In the films early sequences, he is a formidable fighting man, but years later, due to a poor diet, has gained an enormous amount of weight.

Due to the nature of his power, he displays supernatural durability, being able to take Wolverines elbow to his face and return to fight moments later. When asked about his thoughts on the character, Kitsch had said, "I knew of him, but I didnt know the following he had. Im sure Im still going to be exposed to that. I love the character, I love the powers, and I love what they did with him. I didnt know that much, but in my experience, it was a blessing to go in and create my take on him. Im excited for it, to say the least." 
 David North / Agent Zero:
:A member of the Weapon X program and an expert tracker with lethal sniper skills.  An X-Men fan, Henney liked the role of a villain because "there are no restrictions playing it, allowing you freely to express it, so you can act how you want to".

Hes a teenager. What teenager is the same when theyre 30 years old?" Pocock also described Wolverine as being Cyclops "big transition moment", with the character going from a troubled teenager to a leader throughout the course of the film.

* Tahyna Tozzi as Kaylas sister Emma:
:A mutant with the power to turn her skin into diamond, who in the film is Silverfoxs sister.  The film depiction of Emma was originally assumed to be Emma Frost.

Wolverines parents also appeared in the film;   it is explained that sometimes Professor X uses his telepathy to give the illusion to others that he is standing, when his legs are indeed actually non-functional.

Asher Keddie played Dr. Carol Frost.  Poker player Daniel Negreanu has a cameo. Phil Hellmuth wanted to join him but was unable because he committed to an event in Toronto.  X-Men co-creator Stan Lee said he would cameo, but Lee ended up not appearing in the film as he could not attend filming in Australia.  

==Production==

===Development=== Frank Millers 1982 limited R rating in mind, although he acknowledged the films final tone would rest with the producers and director. 
 Gambit was Pyro in the original trilogy.    David Ayer contributed to the script.  Benioff finished his draft in October 2006, and Jackman stated there would be a year before shooting,    as he was scheduled to start filming Australia (2008 film)|Australia during 2007.  Before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike began, James Vanderbilt and Scott Silver were hired for a last-minute rewrite. 

  director Brett Ratner were interested in returning to the franchise,     while Alexandre Aja and Len Wiseman also wanted the job.   Zack Snyder, who was approached for The Last Stand, turned down this film because he was directing Watchmen (film)|Watchmen.  Jackman saw parallels between Logan and the main character in Hoods previous film Tsotsi.  Hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan, he "realized that the character of Wolverine, I think his great appeal lies in the fact that hes someone who in some ways, is filled with a great deal of self-loathing by his own nature and hes constantly at war with his own nature".    The director described the films themes as focusing on Wolverines inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities. Hood enjoyed the previous films, but set out to give the spin-off a different feel.    Hood also suggested to make the implied blood relation of Wolverine and Sabretooth into them explicitly being half brothers, as it would help "build up the emotional power of the film".  In October, Fox announced a May 1, 2009, release date and the X-Men Origins prefix. 

===Filming=== Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labours decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink. Fox moved some of the explosives to another area.    The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required thirteen cameras.  Jackman and Palermos Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly.  According to Hood, the screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun, with the production in Australia receiving regularly new script pages from Los Angeles, at times in the night before shooting. 
 Cockatoo Island was used for Strykers facility; the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set.  Production of the film was predicted to generate Australian dollar|A$60&nbsp;million for Sydneys economy.  Principal photography ended by May 23. The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23, and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first units wrap.  This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings, which was shot at Blacksmiths, New South Wales. 

Hood and Fox were in dispute on the films direction. One of the disputes involved the depiction of Wolverine as an Army veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, with the executives arguing that audiences would not be interested in such heavy themes.  The studio had two replacements lined up before Richard Donner, husband of producer Lauren Shuler Donner, flew to Australia to ease on-set tensions.  Hood remarked, "Out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate, things get better.   I hope the films better because of the debates. If nobody were talking about us, wed be in trouble!"    Hood added he and Thomas Rothman were both "forceful" personalities in creative meetings but they had never had a "stand-up" argument.  In January 2009, after delays due to weather and scheduling conflicts, such as Hugh Jackmans publicity commitments for Australia (2008 film)|Australia, production moved to Vancouver, mostly at Lord Byng Secondary School and in University of British Columbia.   Work there included finishing scenes with Ryan Reynolds, who had been working on two other films during principal photography. 

Gavin Hood has announced that multiple "secret endings" exist for the film and that the endings will differ from print to print of the film.  One version shows Wolverine drinking in a Japanese bar. The bartender asked if he is drinking to forget, Logan replies that he is drinking to remember.  The other shows Weapon XI on the rubble of the destroyed tower, trying to touch his severed head. 

===Effects===
More than 1,000 shots of Wolverine have visual effects in them, which required three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies to work on the film.    The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambits powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambits plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws.  CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups.    Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.

In a 2008 interview with Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds.com, Gregson-Williams said that Hood attracted him to the project, adding: "I happened to meet him at the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago. That night we were both nominees, but both losers. He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and he seemed like a really smart and creative guy...and into music. So I was really delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine."   

In late March 2009, Jon Burlingame of Variety (magazine)|Variety was at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th century-Fox to listen and report on the recording of the score.    Gregson-Williams conducted "a 78-piece orchestra and a 40-voice choir (20 male, 20 female)" to achieve the sound.  At the time of his visit, Burlingame noted that the choir was singing "stanzas from an ancient Norse poem in Old Icelandic" to underscore what would be first track, "Logan Through Time."  Director Gavin Hood commented on Gregson-Williams style, saying: "Harrys challenge is to give us operatic scale, but also keep it intimate and human. Harrys music has a kind of muscular confidence and strength that is very useful for the action, but he also has tremendous soul."  Hood also called the recording performance "frigging brilliant!" 

==Release==
===Leaked workprint===
On March 31, 2009, a full-length DVD-quality workprint of the film without a timecode or watermark, with some unfinished effects shots, a different typeface for titles and casting, and alternate sound effects was leaked online.          The studio said it would be able to determine the source of the leak using forensic marks in the workprint. The FBI and MPAA began investigating the illegal posting.  Fox estimated the workprint was downloaded roughly 4.5&nbsp;million times by the time Wolverine was released in theaters.  As of 2014, Fox estimates that a minimum of 15 million people downloaded it. 

The print contained a reference to Rising Sun Pictures, an Australian visual effects company working on the film.  The company denied that they ever had a full copy of the film.    Executive producer Thomas Rothman noted the leaked version lacked the ten minutes added during pick-ups in January 2009.   However, the theatrical version of the film has no extra scenes that were not included in the leaked workprint.  Both versions run exactly 107 minutes, but director Gavin Hood said "another ending exists that features the films villain."  The leak was traced down to a Bronx man named Gilberto Sanchez, who had bought a pirated DVD copy from a Korean man and later uploaded it under the name "SkillyGilly".  
 Fox News—a channel also owned by Foxs parent company News Corporation—was fired for writing a review of the film using the leaked copy he downloaded from the Internet.  He described how easy it was to find and download the film even if the original source of the leak was no longer available on the web. The article he wrote for his column on the Fox News website was immediately removed. 

===Marketing===
Among the companies which provided tie-in merchandising were  , featuring  , which writer Jason Aaron said that while not directly influenced by the film, was written considering people who would get interested in Wolverine comics after watching the film. 

In December 2009, Hot Toys released the 12&nbsp;inch highly detailed figure of Wolverine based on the movie with Hugh Jackmans likeness.

===Theatrical run===
X-Men Origins: Wolverine was released on April 29, 2009, in the UK, Denmark, South Africa, and Australia; April 30, 2009 in the Philippines and in the Dominican Republic; and May 1, 2009 in the United States and Canada. A contest was held on the official website to determine the location of the world premiere on April 27.

During its first day of wide release, Wolverine took in an estimated $35&nbsp;million,    with almost $5&nbsp;million of that from midnight showings.  The earnings placed the film as the 16th highest-grossing opening day ever (22nd with ticket-price inflation).  It went on to be number one film at the box office with a total of $85&nbsp;million.     Among summer kick-offs, it ranked fifth behind Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man, X2, Spider-Man 3, and Iron Man and it was in the top ten of comic book adaptations.  The opening was lower than the last film in the franchise, X-Men: The Last Stand, as well as X2, but higher than X-Men, the first film in the series. 

The worldwide opening was over $158.1&nbsp;million, but Fox stated that some markets underperformed, mostly due to the leaked workprint in countries with illegal downloading problems.    However, in an article for the "piracy issue" of Screen International magazine, film critic John Hazelton was doubtful of this explanation, writing that the films initial performance was "uncertain" as the outbreak of swine flu in territories with the worst piracy problems means that other territories did not compare at all. 

While it has received negative reviews from critics, the film has been a financial success at the box office. According to Box Office Mojo Wolverine has grossed approximately $179,883,157 in the United States and Canada. It took in another $193,179,707 in other territories, giving it a worldwide total of $373,062,864.

==Reception==
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported 38% positive reviews based on 252 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The sites consensus is, "Though Hugh Jackman gives his all, he cant help X-Men Origins: Wolverine overcome a cliche-ridden script and familiar narrative." 

Richard Corliss of Time (magazine)|TIME commented on the films standing among other Marvel films, saying that it is "an O.K., not great, Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X-Man, and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy." He also said that "superhero mythologies can be so complicated, only a lonely comic-book-reading kid could make sense of it all."  James Mullinger of GQ also commented on the structure of the story in saying that the "film clumsily tries to explain the origins of James  , AKA Wolverine, which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in the original X-Men saga. In doing so, it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes."  Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was generally more favorable towards Origins, stating "Fortunately, Jackman is well-matched with Schreiber, who can sneer with the best of them and wears fangs well. The two have three spectacular battles together before squaring off against a formidable enemy atop a nuclear reactor."  Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor also praised Jackmans performance, saying that "Hugh Jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a tuxedoed song-and-dance man at the Oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and berserker rage."  Claudia Puig of USA Today considered the movie "well-acted, with spectacular action and witty one-liners". 

  gave Wolverine two and a half stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverines past "theres little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in", and that the revelations made Wolverine "less compelling".  Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC (TV channel)|AMCs Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive "4.0 out of 5 stars," saying that although Hugh Jackman is "capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season." He did however predict that "there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;" and further said that "any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for cant really seal the full entertainment deal." 

Regarding Wolverine within the context of the X-Men film series, Tom Charity of   of   said that the films "dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff" is "of interest only to hardcore fans whove probably read it all in Marvel comics." 

Sukhdev Sandhu of   gave the film a grade of "D", noting that "Wolverine was the lead character of   films, and weve already learned everything we need to know from the films in said franchise," adding that "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting."  Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that "how the hero acquired his special powers turns out to be a whole lot less interesting than what he does with them", while also being "a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing". 
 The Wolverine. 

==Spin-offs==
On September 18, 2014, it was announced that a Deadpool film, a spin-off to the X-Men Origins series, had been given the green light, and a release date of February 12, 2016. This film will be a part of the X-Men (film series)|X-Men film series.   On December 4, 2014, it was confirmed that Ryan Reynolds would reprise his role for the film, with filming starting in March 2015.
