Ben received mixed to positive reviews, currently holding a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  The consensus was that the film was decent, but not as scary as the original Willard (2003 film)|Willard. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and wrote "This isnt a thriller but a geek movie. In a thriller, were supposed to be scared by some awesome menace to mankind -- the Green Blob maybe, or Big Foot, or the Invincible Squid and his implacable enemy, red wine sauce. But in a geek movie, the whole idea is to be disgusted because the actors have rats all over them."
