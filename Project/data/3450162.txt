Grand Slam is a 1978 sports comedy film produced by BBC Wales. The film starred Academy Awards|Oscar-winning actor Hugh Griffith, Windsor Davies, Dewi "Pws" Morris and Sion Probert. The play was written for television by Gwenlyn Parry and then-head of drama for BBC Wales, John Hefin.

== Synopsis ==
 Wales play France in Five Nations Grand Slam title. One of the party is Caradog Lloyd-Evans (Griffith), who briefly served in occupied Paris near the end of World War II. Caradog pays for his son Glyns air ticket on the proviso that Glyn comes on a pilgrimage to find his little butterfly who he spent a short romantic period with during the war. This pilgrimage is successful and although the right place is found, it is no longer the innocent bistro of his youth but one of many strip club joints. Mr Lloyd-Evans mistakes a young girl in the club (who is a spitting image of his little butterfly) for the real thing and finds that the girl is actually Odette (Sharon Morgan), the daughter of his old flame. He is (naturally) disappointed but Glyn (Dewi "Pws" Morris) gets himself acquainted with Odette while Caradog reminisces with his butterfly (played by Marika Rivera). A quick call to the hotel brings the entire tour party to the club where fun and frolicking takes place led by Mog (Davies). Some locals take exception and a mass brawl starts which ends with the arrival of the police. The whole party is arrested except Caradog (protected by his butterfly Madame) and Glyn (hidden in Odettes bedroom).

Sion Probert plays camp boutique owner Maldwyn Pugh, who is the only one of the main four characters who makes the start of the match, because Mog is still in jail as he was considered the ringleader (the others were released), Caradog is with his butterfly and Glyn is trying for his own sexual Grand Slam with Odette. Mog is eventually released halfway through the first half of the match, but when he finally arrives at the stadium, theres only seconds of the game left, which Wales lose. Caradog is found collapsed near the table, and Madame thinks he has died, but Odette fires a soda siphon on his face, and the story ends with Caradog warning his son of the dangers of overseas travel.

The airport scenes were filmed at Cardiff Airport.
*Wales 16-9 defeat on the day of the match led to a rewrite of some of the films closing scenes and a new scene with Mog and Maldwyn contemplating next years Wales v France fixture at Cardiff Arms Park (which saw Wales beat France 16-7 to win the Grand Slam and the 1978 Five Nations).
