Lost and Delirious is a 2001 Canadian drama film directed by Léa Pool and loosely based on the novel The Wives of Bath by Susan Swan. Lost and Delirious is filmed from the perspective of Mary (Mischa Barton), who observes the changing love between her two teenage friends, Pauline (Piper Perabo) and Victoria (Jessica Paré). The film premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. 

== Plot summary ==
When shy and introspective Mary arrives as a new freshman student at an all-girls boarding school, she shares a dorm room with two seniors, Paulie and Victoria (nicknamed Tori). In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Marys very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Marys roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her "Mary Brave".

Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Toris rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation.
 Luke Kirby), flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brothers 18th birthday party and making it clear that he is interested in her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boys interest in her, saying, "He liked my tits." When Mary asks if shell go to the party, Tori says, "And have all those gross guys groping me? No, thanks. Id rather stay home and do math."

Over time, Paulie and Tori become more comfortable showing affection in front of Mary. It progresses from a quick kiss on the lips in front of her to the two sharing a bed and having sex while they think Mary is sleeping. At first, Mary is shy about sharing a room with the two lovers and feels like an intruder. After a few days, she finds their kissing and murmuring comforting and familiar.
 unrequited crush on her and crawled into her bed. Her sister promises to "fix" the rumors about Tori and not tell their parents anything. As she walks away from this conversation, Victoria collapses into tears.

In the library, Victoria explains to Mary that her family is strongly opposed to homosexuality, and she must stop the relationship to prevent their rejection. She creates an image of heterosexuality to her friends and her sister, and then she begins Jake and avoiding Paulie. Mary sympathizes with both of her friends, as she too feels rejected by her father, who does not bother to show up to a father/daughter dance. In the forest at night, Tori and Jake have sex against a tree. Both Mary and Paulie accidentally witness this scene and run back to their room before Tori returns.

When Tori returns to the room, Paulie asks her where shes been and Tori says she was with a friend. Paulie lashes out at her by telling her that she saw what Tori and Jake were doing in the woods. Tori tells Paulie that the intimacy that they had shared will never happen again but she (Tori) would always love her.

Paulie cannot handle Toris withdrawal from the relationship. She smashes a mirror and hurls a dish cart to the ground and begins to act out in other ways. A rejection letter from the agency that handled Paulies adoption, which says that her birth mother denied a request from Paulie to get in touch, further sends her over the edge. Upset, Paulie leaves the building and runs into Mrs. Vaughn, with whom she discusses her love for Tory, and Mrs. Vaughn tells her she understands. Paulie then goes on to say "Without her, I would just die." 

At the climax, Paulie declares a duel to the death with Jake with fencing swords.  Jake is not taking her seriously until he ends up on the ground, with Paulie brandishing a sword above him. She demands that he give up Tori.  When he refuses, she stabs him in the leg.  Mary rushes to stop her and Paulie runs off.  Mary runs to Victorias soccer match, where the headmistress, math teacher and fellow students are congregated.  Upon reaching the group, Mary sees Paulie, sobbing from the top of a building while holding her falcon. Whispering "I rush into the secret house," a Shakespearean reference to suicide, Paulie jumps to her death and the movie ends with the falcon flying in the background.

==Reception==
The film garnered a mixed reaction from critics. Based on 58 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes it is certified "rotten", with an approval rating of 50%. The consensus reads, "Lost and Delirious becomes exactly that, as the film sinks into overwrought melodrama and cliched, obvious symbolism." 

The performances of Perabo, Paré and Barton were, however, widely praised.  Perabos performance in particular received critical acclaim, which Loren King of the Chicago Tribune remarked was her "breakout performance".  Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman called her "an actress of glittering ferocity" and her performance "a geyser of emotion".  Jim Lane of the Sacramento News & Review said that "Perabo is a revelation, wild and fiery—it’s a breakthrough performance, astonishing in its fervency"  and Roger Ebert praised her performance for its sincerity and "wonderful abandon and conviction". Ebert went on to give the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing that the film "stirred within me memories of that season in adolescence when the heart leaps up in passionate idealism—and inevitably mingles it with sexual desire." Ebert praised Pool as she "creates a lush, thoughtfully framed, and composed film; her classical visual style lends gravitas to this romantic story."
