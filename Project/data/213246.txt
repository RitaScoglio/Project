 science fiction action horror Los Angeles, California.
 Alien queen is surgically removed from her body. The United Systems Military hopes to breed Aliens to study and research on the spaceship USM Auriga, using human hosts kidnapped and delivered to them by a group of mercenaries. The Aliens escape their enclosures, while Ripley and the mercenaries attempt to escape and destroy the Auriga before it reaches its destination, Earth.

Alien: Resurrection was released on November 26, 1997 and received mixed reviews from film critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt "there is not a single shot in the movie to fill one with wonder",  while Desson Thomson of The Washington Post said the film "satisfactorily recycles the great surprises that made the first movie so powerful". 

==Plot== clone of Alien queen that had been growing inside her at the time of her death, raise it, and collect its eggs for further use. The Ripley clone is kept alive for further study. As a result of her DNA being mixed with the Aliens DNA during the cloning process, she develops enhanced strength and reflexes, has acidic blood and a psychic link with the Aliens.

A group of mercenary|mercenaries, Elgyn (Michael Wincott), Johner (Ron Perlman), Christie (Gary Dourdan), Vriess (Dominique Pinon), Hillard (Kim Flowers), and Call (Winona Ryder), arrive in their ship, the Betty, delivering several kidnapped humans in stasis (fiction)|stasis. The military scientists use the kidnapped humans as hosts for the Aliens, raising several adult Aliens for study.

The Betty crew soon encounters Ripley. Call recognizes Ripleys name and tries to kill her, suspecting she may be used to create more Aliens. However, the Aliens have already matured and quickly escape confinement. They damage the Auriga and kill those crew members who do not manage to evacuate, including General Perez (Dan Hedaya) and Elgyn. Military scientist Dr. Wren (J. E. Freeman) reveals that the ships default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing this will unleash the Aliens on Earth, Ripley, the mercenaries, Wren, a Marine named DiStephano (Raymond Cruz), and surviving Alien host Purvis (Leland Orser), decide to head for the Betty and use it to destroy the Auriga.

Ripley soon finds a side room containing all of the previous failed clones of herself, and she proceeds to incinerate them after one tells her to kill them.

As the group make their way through the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two Aliens. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the Alien returns and kills Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the Alien so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is revealed to be an android (robot)|android. Using her ability to interface with the Auriga  s systems, Call sets it on a collision course with Earth, hoping to destroy the Aliens in the crash. She cuts off Wrens route of escape, and directs the Aliens towards him. Ripley is captured by the Aliens, while the other survivors head for the Betty. There, Wren shoots Purvis and takes Call hostage, demanding that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis violently attacks Wren and forces his head to his chest just as the Alien embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wrens head and kill them both. The survivors then shoot at the embryo.
 Xenomorph with human traits, such as human teeth, mouth, pale skin color and a human-like face with actual eyes. After killing the queen Alien, the hybrid Alien recognizes Ripley as its mother, before biting the scalp off Gediman, who was captured by the Aliens during the breakout, and has been cocooned. Ripley takes advantage of the distraction to escape, though the hybrid Alien still sees her.

Ripley makes her way to the Betty. They cannot launch because a cargo bay hatch is stuck open. Call goes to close it; while she attempts to, the Newborn Alien appears on the cargo deck behind her. The Newborn, showing intellect, forces the hatch closed enabling the ship to depart. The hybrid Alien then attacks Call and kills DiStephano when he enters the area to help Call with an auxiliary pump.

Ripley finds her way onto the Betty, and saves Call from the Newborn, which embraces Ripley. She then notices a cargo area window port. She cuts her hand on the tooth of the Newborn, and flings the acidic blood onto a nearby window. Call and Ripley manage to save themselves while the Newborn is sucked violently out of the now broken window, as Ripley sobs.

The countdown on the Auriga continues as the survivors escape in the Betty. The Auriga collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. Call and Ripley look out of the port window of the Betty, and watch as the sun sets beyond the clouds.

In an alternate ending, the Betty lands on Earth in a destroyed Paris, France. Ripley and Call discuss life on Earth, with Ripley telling Call that "I am a stranger here myself."

==Production==

===Origins=== third act on Earth, with a final battle for Earth itself.     Whedon wrote five versions of the final act, none of which ended up in the film. 
 Walter Hill, who opposed the production of Alien: Resurrection, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.   

Sigourney Weaver, who had played Ripley throughout the series, wanted to liberate the character in Alien 3 as she did not want Ripley to become "a figure of fun" who would continuously "wake up with monsters running around". The possibility of an Alien vs. Predator film was another reason for the characters death, as she thought the concept "sounded awful". However, Weaver was impressed with Whedons script. She thought that the error during Ripleys cloning process would allow her to further explore the character, since Ripley becoming part human and part Alien would create uncertainty about where her loyalties lay. This was an interesting concept to Weaver, who thought the film brought back the spirit of Alien (film)|Alien and Aliens (film)|Aliens.  Weaver received a co-producer credit and was reportedly paid $11&nbsp;million. 

===Direction and design===
Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting director Danny Boyle was the producers first choice to direct the film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, but he was not interested in pursuing the project. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an Alien film. {{cite web

Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the films producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was surprised he was offered the job for Alien: Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea.    Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. {{cite web

Jeunet hired French special effects supervisor Pitof and cinematographer Darius Khondji, both of whom he had worked with on The City of Lost Children. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction and Alien films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the Alien films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although the expensive ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a dark comedy and was encouraged to include more violence. In June 1996, Jeunets frequent co-director, conceptual artist Marc Caro had drawn rough sketches of characters costumes, which were shown to veteran costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design. 

===Creatures===
 s, which were removed during post-production]]
Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) was hired for the film, having previously worked on Alien 3. ADI founders Tom Woodruff, Jr. and Alec Gillis also had experience working with Stan Winston on Aliens. ADI based their designs and modifications of the Alien creatures on the films script, which included the creatures having pointed tails for swimming, making their head domes and chins more pointed, and establishing them to appear more vicious using techniques of camera angles and shot duration. After receiving the directors approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models.   
 hybrid creature more human than Alien. An early concept was to replicate Sigourney Weavers features, although the crew felt this design would be too similar to the design of the creature Sil from the 1995 film Species (film)|Species. Eyes and a nose were added to the hybrid to allow it to have more expressions and communicate more emotion than the Aliens, so that it would have more depth as a character rather than being "just a killing machine".  Jeunet was adamant about the hybrid having genitalia which resembled a mix of male and female sexes. 20th Century Fox was uncomfortable with this, however, and Jeunet eventually changed his mind, feeling that "even for a Frenchman, its too much".  The genitalia were removed during post-production using digital effects techniques. The animatronic hybrid required nine puppeteers and was the most complex animatronic in the film. 

===Filming===
Alien: Resurrection was filmed at Fox studios in   were taking place at the same time. Alien Resurrection was the first installment in the Alien series to be filmed outside of England, a decision made by Weaver, who believed that the previous films travel schedules exhausted the crew. 

The underwater scene was the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45&nbsp;meter tank, 4.5&nbsp;meters deep, containing 548,000&nbsp;gallons of water. {{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-31| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080106122006/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290562,00.html| archivedate= 6 January 2008  | deadurl= no}}  The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would be able to use the tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway theatre|Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.   

Director Jeunet wanted to display Ripleys new powers, including a scene in which Ripley throws a basketball through a hoop while facing the opposite direction. Weaver trained for ten days and averaged one out of six baskets, although the distance required for filming was farther than she had practiced. Jeunet was concerned about the time being spent on the shot and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Weaver, however, was determined to make the shot authentic, and insisted on doing it herself. The shot required many dozens of takes, during which none of the balls went in. The crew were going to give up, but gave Weaver one last shot, and in this take, she got the ball in perfectly; the idea that she did it in one take is a myth. The ball was out of frame for a moment during the shot, and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was on-screen for the entire scene, but Weaver refused. Ron Perlman broke character when she made the basket, and turned to the camera to say "Oh my god!" There was enough of a pause between Weavers basket and Perlmans statement for the films editors to cut the scene accordingly during post-production.   

===Visual effects and miniatures===
The films script was laid out similar to a comic book, with pictures on the left and dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the companys work on Joes Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.   

All of the spaceships in the film were miniatures, as visual effects supervisors believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the films opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory in the films 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martins design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretzs design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.   

===Music===
  Robert Kraft had a short meeting with Frizzell and hired him.    Frizzell spent seven months writing and recording the score, which Jeunet requested to be very different and unique from the previous films in the series. This included themes of romance and eroticism, incorporating sound effects such as a gong and rub rod. The cue "They Swim" took one month to complete as Jeunet was not pleased with Frizzells original version, although the final result was a mix between the first and third versions he had composed.

Screenwriter Joss Whedon was unhappy with the final product. When asked in 2005 how the film differed from the script he had written, Whedon responded: 
"It wasnt a question of doing everything differently, although they changed the ending; it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong. They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. Theres actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed it in such a ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." 
 

Conversely, H. R. Giger, designer of the original Alien, was pleased with Resurrection, describing it as an "excellent film", but was disappointed about not being credited in the film. 

====Accolades====
 

==Home media==
Alien: Resurrection was first released onto home video in the VHS and DVD formats on June 1, 1998. The film received its first Blu-ray release as part of the Alien Anthology box set released in 2010 including all four films and their alternate versions. The film was re-released on Blu-ray on May 10, 2011 in a stand-alone feature.

===2003 Special Edition===
In 2003, Jeunet included an alternate version of the film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens (film)|Aliens, Vriess making a joke to Call, Ripleys clone waking up in the middle of her operation, an extended dialogue between Call and Ripleys clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planets landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as they view the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 7 minutes worth of footage. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a directors cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.

Alien: Resurrection: Collectors Edition was released on January 6, 2004, containing the  two discs contained in the Quadrilogy set. The second disc, called One Step Beyond: The Making of Alien Resurrection, features over two hours of footage relating to pre-production, production, post-production, screen tests, concept art, and audio commentary by the cast and crew.

==Merchandising==
To coincide with the release of the film, a book titled Making of Alien: Resurrection was released on November 28, 1997 in addition to a novelization of the film released on December 1, 1997.       Dark Horse Comics also published a two-issue comic book adaptation.   Kenner Toys produced a line of 6" scale action figures for the film. The characters were Ripley, Call, Newborn Alien, Aqua Alien, Battle-Scarred Alien, and Warrior Alien.

==Sequel== greenlit Alien Alien vs. Frankenstein Meets Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other". Although he liked Alien vs. Predator, Cameron ruled out any future involvement with the series. 

In a 2002 interview, Ridley Scott stated that a new Alien project "would be a lot of fun", but that "the most important thing was to get the story right". Scotts concept for the plot was "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created".  In late 2008, Weaver hinted in an interview with MTV that she and Scott were working on an Alien spinoff film, which would focus on the chronicles of Ellen Ripley rather than on the Aliens, but the continuation of Ripleys story has not materialized.  Instead, Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus, was released in 2012. A sequel to Prometheus has also been announced but has yet to go into production.

At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver hinted that shed be interested in returning to the role of Ripley, saying: "Had we done a fifth one, I dont doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. … I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story."    She was quoted: "I dont think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in the far reaches of the universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." 

In February 2015, Neill Blomkamp posted artwork of an Alien film on his Instagram, announcing that he had been signed on to direct a new Alien film.  Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn are in talks to return in their leading roles.
