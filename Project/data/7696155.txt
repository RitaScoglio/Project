 Polish comedy film released in 1978 in film|1978, directed by Stanisław Bareja.
 screwball comedies are never boring.
 Teddy Bear, with an emphasis on the sheer abusurdity of life under Communism. The plot is too convoluted to be believed, but the director makes screamingly funny scenes from watching hapless citizens of Warsaw using a glass in a cafeteria thats been chained to the table so it wont be stolen or waiting in line for days to buy furniture.
