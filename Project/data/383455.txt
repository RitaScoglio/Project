==Plot==
   While lying in the bathtub, Justine slits her wrists, dying quietly as the water fills with her blood. 

Because she has lived a "pure" life, Miss Jones finds herself in limbo. There she meets Mr. Abaca (John Clemens), an angel, of sorts, who informs her that she does not qualify for entrance to Heaven because she has killed herself. Angry that this one indiscretion has left her with only the options of limbo or Hell, she begs Mr. Abaca to let her "earn" her place in Hell by being allowed to return to earth and become the embodiment of lust.  After an intense session of pain and pleasure with a menacing man who goes only by the title of "The Teacher" (Harry Reems),   Justine has a few bizarre and sexually deviant encounters, the last of which is a graphic group sex|threesome.

However, just as she is enjoying her new life of lust, the brief time Justine was given to fulfill herself runs out and she is faced with the eternity of Hell. At first, Miss Jones is horrified at the pain she will be forced to endure, but Abaca is quick to dispel the common human myth of Hell and promises Justine that she will be "quite comfortable..."
 impotent man flies than her.    She desperately begs the man for sex, but he simply asks her to be quiet while he listens to the buzzing of his imaginary insects.

==Georgina Spelvin==
Spelvin was 36 when she made the film.  The Devil in Miss Jones was one of her first acting appearances following a career as a chorus girl on Broadway where she featured in productions such as Guys and Dolls, Sweet Charity, and The Pajama Game.  , The Rialto Report, May 19, 2013 

Her role in The Devil In Miss Jones was typical of her career, as she often played celibate spinsters who have a sexual awakening, then become sex fiends (e.g. Sleepyhead).  She also meets a tragic end in several of her other films.  The film marked the first time she used the moniker Georgina Spelvin, a reference to George Spelvin, a traditional stagename used to hide a performers identity, for any number of reasons.   According to her interview on Daves Old Porn, Spelvin also did the craft services and cooking on the set.  The actress billed in the movie as Claire Lumiere was hired to do craft services only, but was offered $100 to do a lesbian scene with Spelvin, which she accepted.

In an audio interview with The Rialto Report in 2013, Spelvin spoke about how she and Lumiere were lovers at the time and they accepted the adult film work as a means of raising money for their film collective.

==Critical reception==
As with the other films of the porno chic era, it was reviewed by the film critics of mainstream newspapers.   The films review in Variety (magazine)|Variety said that, "With The Devil in Miss Jones, the hard-core porno feature approaches an art form, one that critics may have a tough time ignoring in the future", and compared its plot to Jean-Paul Sartres play No Exit. Lewis, p.211  The review went on to say, "Damiano has expertly fashioned a bizarre melodrama", and described the opening scene as, "a sequence so effective it would stand out in any legit theatrical feature."  It finished by stating, "Booking a film of this technical quality into a standard sex house is tantamount to throwing it on the trash heap of most current hard-core fare." 
 Deep Throat, Devil in Miss Jones, Behind the Green Door - that have a minimal but still sufficient artistic interest to distinguish themselves from the rest of the genre". 

Other critics have described it as, along with Deep Throat, one of the "two best erotic motion pictures ever made".  Roger Ebert referred to the film as the "best" of the genre he had seen and gave it three-stars (of four).    William Friedkin has called it a "great film", partly because it was one of the few porn films with a proper storyline.  It was one of the first films to be inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame.
