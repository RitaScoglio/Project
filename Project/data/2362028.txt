By stripping the general (Toni Ribas) of all his rank and power, then sending him to become a slave who must fight in the arena to entertain the citizens, the thought is that the general will die an early death and never bother him again. Needless to say, the general survives, and thrives, which makes him become a threat to those who stole his position.

===In the City of Lust===
General Maximus, after becoming a slave, returns to Rome to take revenge on Commodus. But in order to do so, he must first become a gladiator, win glory in the arena, make himself loved by the public, and become a myth. When he arrives in the city, he meets Domitila, Caesars cousin, and an old love of his. Upon seeing him again, she gives free rein to her passion, but then must do battle with Siria, the slave-girl who is with Maximus. 
 patricians with lupanars and the parties held by Commodus and his henchmen bring to life a series of highly erotic and shocking sex scenes, with disturbing and sinful women, lovers of debauchery and proud of their arts.
