==Reception==
Critical reaction to The Cell has been mixed, with a score of 45% on  , its also a story where we care about the characters; theres a lot at stake at the end, and were involved. I know people who hate it, finding it pretentious or unrestrained; I think its one of the best films of the year."  Ebert later placed the film on his list of "The Best 10 Movies of 2000", writing: "Tarsem, the director, is a visual virtuoso who juggles his storylines effortlessly; its dazzling, the way he blends so many notes, styles and genres into a film so original." 

James Berardinelli gave the film three stars out of four, writing: "The Cell becomes the first serial killer feature in a long time to take the genre in a new direction. Not only does it defy formulaic expectations, but it challenges the viewer to think and consider the horrors that can turn an ordinary child into an inhuman monster. There are no easy answers, and The Cell doesnt pretend to offer any. Instead, Singh presents audiences with the opportunity to go on a harrowing journey. For those who are up to the challenge, its worth spending time in The Cell."  
 misogynistic imagery in years, then ends with a bid for understanding."  Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader remarked, "Theres almost no plot here and even less character &mdash; just a lot of pretexts for Sadomasochism|S&M imagery, Catholic decor, gobs of gore, and the usual designer schizophrenia." 

The film received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Makeup.
