The next morning, the explosive goes off as planned and Marty and his gang succeed in stealing gold bars from the vault.  They set off to a remote log cabin|cabin, led by a local guide named Gil Jackson (Michael Forest), where they hope to be picked up by a plane.  Gil is initially unaware of their plans, but he becomes suspicious when he hears reports of the robbery on the radio and discovers that theyre carrying handguns.  They reach the cabin without incident, but once there, a violent snowstorm delays the planes arrival.  Martys "secretary," Gypsy (Sheila Noonan), is taken by the young Gil and tells him that Marty plans to kill him once the plane arrives.  Gil and Gypsy take off back to town together.

Marty, who still carries unpleasant memories of his encounter with the beast, has all the while been concerned about being followed.  He encounters the beast again during the trip to the cabin, but his companions think hes losing his mind.  Eventually, however, they become convinced of the beasts reality when they see it attack the other of Martys henchmen, Byron (Wally Campo).  Despite their fears of further attacks, the gang is set on tracking down Gil and Gypsy before they reach town, so they head to a nearby cave.  Another snowstorm forces Gil and Gypsy to take shelter in the cave as well, which turns out to be the lair of the beast.
