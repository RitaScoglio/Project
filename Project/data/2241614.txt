== Plot ==

Badal (Bobby Deol) is a naive but intelligent young man who comes from a small village to the big city. He is introduced to city life by Damru (Harish Patel) who calls himself Danny. When Badal attends college, he meets pretty and precocious Tina Oberoi (Twinkle Khanna) and, after a few misunderstanding and misadventures, they fall in love.

This is not taken well by Tinas dad (Raj Babbar) who hopes to marry Tina with his friends (Bharat Kapoor) son. Tinas dad complains to the college principal (Vijay Kashyap), but Tina testifies in favour of Badal. Tinas dad then asks a corrupt cop, Negi, the citys assistant commissioner of police, for assistance. Negi arrests Badal on trumped-up charges and imprisons him. Badals dad (Mukesh Khanna) comes to the big city to try to make sense of why Badal is prison. Tinas dad gives a contract to Negi to have Badal killed. Negi agrees and hires a gang of ruthless outlaws to hunt and kill Badal. He also pressures Tina not to acknowledge and meet Badal anymore, and Tina reluctantly agrees. When she learns that he is not dead she goes to him. In an effort to save her, her father dies and Badal kills Negi. At last, Tina and Badal unite.
