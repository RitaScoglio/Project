Doctor Faustus is a 1967 film adaptation of Christopher Marlowes The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, written in 1588. The first theatrical film version of a Marlowe play, it starred and was directed by Richard Burton, (Nevill Coghill, Burtons mentor,    is also given credit for directing), who played the title character Faustus. Elizabeth Taylor made a silent cameo appearance as Helen of Troy, an appearance at which critics of the day invariably sneered. 
 Broadway ten years later.

==Reviews==
Reviews of the staged version in the British press were "less than enthusiastic", with critics commenting "a sad example of university drama at its worst", with an uninspired Burton "walking through the part". Taylor was "undeniably decorative, but there was nothing much to say about her acting ability".  The movie received a terribly negative review in The New York Times, Renata Adler criticizing the adaptation of the text ("the play has been quite badly cut"), Burtons performance ("he seems happiest shouting in Latin, or in Ms. Taylors ear"), the score ("some horrible electronic Wagnerian theme music"), and Taylors role ("in this last role  , she is, for some reason, frosted all over with silver--like a pastry, or a devaluated refugee from Goldfinger"), reserving praise only for Teubers performance ("one fine, very pious performance").
