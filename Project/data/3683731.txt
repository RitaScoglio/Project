==Background==

This was the first of two films in which Powell and Skelton co-starred. It is considered a lesser effort on both actors behalf, however the film is chiefly remembered today for including Frank Sinatra, who appears in an uncredited performance as a singer with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. The movie also is credited with one of the most unusual displays of dance on screen for a sequence in which Powells character, needing to communicate a message to a (real) US agent in the audience of one of her shows, manages to tap out the message in morse code. (Reportedly, Powell taps genuine code during the performance.)

Skelton and Powell next paired up in 1943s I Dood It. In that film, they appeared with Jimmy Dorsey, Tommys brother.
