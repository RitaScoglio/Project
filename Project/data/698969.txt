}} The Horse Whisperer by Nicholas Evans. Redford plays the title role, a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses, who is hired to help an injured teenager (played by Scarlett Johansson) and her horse back to health following a tragic accident.

==Plot== put down. Graces mother, Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas), a strong-minded and workaholic magazine editor, refuses to allow Pilgrim to be put down, sensing that somehow Graces recovery is linked with Pilgrims.

Desperate for a way to heal both Grace and Pilgrim, Annie tracks down a "horse whisperer", Tom Booker (Robert Redford), in the remote Montana mountains. Tom agrees to help, but only if Grace also takes part in the process. Grace reluctantly agrees, and she and Annie go to stay at the Booker ranch where Tom lives with his brother and his brothers family. As Pilgrim and Grace slowly overcome their trauma, Annie and Tom begin to develop a mutual attraction. However, they are both reluctant to act on these feelings&nbsp;– Annie is married and Tom had his heart broken before, when his wife left him because she belonged to the city, not the ranch. Tom also asks Grace to tell him about what happened with her and Pilgrim in order to find out what Pilgrim is thinking. At first, Grace is reluctant, but eventually gathers up her courage, and tearfully tells him about the accident.

The status quo between Annie and Tom is broken when Robert MacLean (Sam Neill), Graces father and Annies husband, unexpectedly shows up at the ranch. Annie is increasingly torn by her feelings for Tom and her love for her family. Soon, with Toms help, Grace finally takes the last step to heal herself and Pilgrim&nbsp;– riding Pilgrim again. As the MacLeans get ready to leave the Booker ranch, Robert tells Annie that he knew Annie was in love with Tom, and gently asks Annie to make her decision one way or another before going home. Although Annie wishes she could stay with Tom on the ranch, she also knows that she belongs to the city, just like Toms wife. Annie departs, driving away from the ranch, while Tom watches her go from the top of a hill.

==Background==
Although he had already directed several films, this was the first time Robert Redford directed a film that he also starred in. 
 Ray Hunt and, in particular, their younger disciple Buck Brannaman.  Brannaman also doubled for Robert Redford in the film and served as the consultant. Evans himself said, "Others have claimed to be the inspiration for Tom Booker in The Horse Whisperer. The one who truly inspired me was Buck Brannaman. His skill, understanding and his gentle, loving heart have parted the clouds for countless troubled creatures. Buck is the Zen master of the horse world." 

==Horse training methods and controversies== Ray Hunt and Buck Brannaman."  Tom Dorrance and Ray Hunt were quite elderly at the time Evans met them (Dorrance and Hunt are since deceased), Brannaman is still a relatively young man.

The horse training methods shown are not entirely without controversy. While Brannaman was the on-site technical consultant, he did not have creative control. The constraints of film-making required a number of sequences to be edited for length, thus not showing some critical training elements that would normally be used. A few basic safety problems in the film include Redford kneeling in front of a horse known to charge humans in one scene, and wearing a large ring on his finger while training in another, a risky practice in the real world when simultaneously handling a dangerous horse and a rope.
 horse psychology was that of having Pilgrim, apparently a well-trained horse, suddenly became a vicious rogue following a single traumatic event. A horse may have a strong reaction after an accident if the elements that preceded the trauma are repeated at a future time (for example, it would be reasonable for Pilgrim to have developed a fear of vehicles, of crossing a road, or of climbing a steep slope),  but not generally a complete change in personality, manner and outlook in the way that can occur in traumatized humans. Such behavioral changes in a horse would normally be the result of sustained, long-term animal abuse.
 John Lyons, provided an equestrianism|equestrians critique of the film, noting that while there were many positive messages, there was also the potential for people to get some dangerous messages about horse training from certain sequences. He first noted that the multiple horses that played Pilgrim were all well-trained animals and that the movie did not represent a real-life time frame for training a single real-life animal. He pointed out that the film made the rehabilitation of the horse appear to be a one-session event, when in reality it would take considerable time for such a change to occur. Lyons criticized a number of dangerous practices shown in the movie, and was particularly critical of the scene where Booker hobbles, ropes, and lays the exhausted horse on the ground, then has Grace get on the recumbent horse, which is then allowed to rise, and the horse and girl miraculously are both cured of their fears and once again a horse and rider team. He argued that the actual real-life practical risk of injury to horse and human in such a method is considerable, that a horse pushed to exhaustion is not "trained," and pushing a fearful rider in such a fashion is ill-advised. However, Lyons critique also recognized the limitations of Hollywood film-making, stating, "In order to tell a story, things are often done that would be imprudent for horse owners to attempt."  

==Reception==
The film received mixed-to-positive reviews upon its release. Janet Maslin in The New York Times says that the film "sustains great visual intensity thanks to Robert Richardsons majestic cinematography" but its "rock-solid values" are diluted by "a misconceived ending",  whereas CNN in a rather sarcastic review complains that the storytelling was "all done very, very slowly"  and mentions the films length. Rotten Tomatoes reports that of 55 reviews, 73% were positive  and Metacritic gives the film an average score of 65/100, based on 19 reviews.  Despite this, the film was a box office hit and grossed $187 million worldwide ($75m in the US).
 Gwil Owen was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, though it lost out to "When You Believe" from The Prince of Egypt. Moorer performs the song in the movie.

==In popular culture==
The movies popularity led to the word "whisperer" being coined as a slang term for anyone with a strong affinity for a particular animal or being.
