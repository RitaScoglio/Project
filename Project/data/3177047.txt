Two Tars is a Laurel and Hardy short film, directed by James Parrott and released in 1928. A silent film, it largely consists of a reciprocal destruction involving motorists in a traffic jam, which has much inventive mayhem with the destruction of various automobiles.

==Plot==
Sailors on leave, Laurel and Hardy pick up two girls and spend the afternoon driving in the country. They find themselves in the middle of a huge traffic jam. Tempers boil over among the motorists, and soon the street is a mess of mangled cars and car parts.
