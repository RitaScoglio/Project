During a surprise 42nd birthday party for well-known composer George Webber (Dudley Moore), thrown by his girlfriend Samantha Taylor (Julie Andrews), he finds hes coping badly with incipient middle age. When George glimpses a bride (Bo Derek) in her wedding car hes instantly obsessed by her beauty, following her to the church where he crashes into a police cruiser and is stung by a bee. George visits the priest, and learns the woman is Jenny Miles, daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills dentist. Later that night, Sam and George have an argument about Georges failure to give her the attention she needs, his use of the term "broad (disambiguation)|broad", and the fact that he and his neighbor (a wealthy porn producer) watch each other perform carnal acts using telescopes. The final straw for Sam occurs when George makes a remark subtly impugning her femininity at which point Sam leaves in a huff.

Although George is initially elated to find all of his fantasies being fulfilled, he is horrified when Jenny takes a call from her husband while in bed with him and casually informs him of Georges presence. He is even more confused when David responds with a complete lack of concern (he had called to thank George for saving his life). When Jenny explains their open relationship and mutual honesty, George is appalled; realizing that in contrast to the complete infatuation he has had with her, Jenny sees him as nothing more than a "casual lay", George loses interest in her and he heads back to Beverly Hills.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a glowing four-out-of-four star review, calling it "one of the best films Blake Edwards has ever made" and stating "What were struck with, in 10, is the uncanny way its humor gets laughs by touching on emotions and yearnings that are very real for us.

==Cultural impact  == cornrow hairstyle in the film was widely copied and became Eponymous hairstyle|eponymous.   Additionally, the scene where George sees Dereks character, Jenny, running on the beach in Mexico has become iconic and often parodied. 

The film also brought renewed fame to the one-movement orchestral piece Boléro by Maurice Ravel. Use of the piece during the love scene between Derek and Moores characters, with Jenny describing it as "the most descriptive sex music ever written", resulted in massive sales of the work. Because Ravels music was still under copyright at the time, sales of Boléro generated his estate an estimated $1 million in royalties and briefly made him the best selling classical composer—over 40 years after his death.  Derek later appeared in a 1984 film named Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero, titled to capitalize upon the pieces regenerated popularity.
