== Plot ==
Lankester Merrin is a veteran Catholic priest who is on an archeological dig in Iraq. There he finds an amulet which resembles the statue of Pazuzu, a demon who Merrin defeated years ago. Merrin then realizes the demon has returned to get his revenge. 
    
Meanwhile in Georgetown, Washington, D.C, famous actress Chris MacNeil is living on location with her pre-teen daughter Regan. After playing with an Ouija board Regan begins acting strangely including making mysterious noises, using constant bad language and exhibiting abnormal strength. Regan also causes her bed to shake, much to her and Chriss horror. In response, her mother consults several physicians but despite undergoing a series of unpleasant diagnostic tests, Dr. Klein and his associates find nothing medically wrong with her, unaware that she is now fully possessed by Pazuzu. 
 
One night Regan kills her babysitter and Chris director, Burke Dennings. His murder is investigated by a detective named William Kinderman. He interviews Chris as well as a young priest and psychiatrist named Damien Karras, who has lost faith in God after his frail mother died. Chris knows that Regan was the only one who was in the house when Dennings died.

After the doctors decide that an exorcism may be the only way to help Regan, Chris arranges a meeting with Karras. Karras at first refuses to get permission to perform an exorcism, despite Regan now being completely possessed by the demon. After getting a recording of her talking in reverse and seeing the words "Help Me" on her stomach Karras decides to perform an exorcism with Merrin chosen to help.

In Regans bedroom both men try to exorcise the demon but a stubborn Pazuzu toys with them, especially Karras, including insulting his late mother. After a break and hint of faltering, Karras is dismissed. Merrin attempts the exorcism alone. Karras enters the room and discovers Merrin has died and confronts the mocking, laughing spirit of Pazuzu. At Karras plea, Pazuzu then possesses Karras, leaving Regans body. In a moment of self-sacrifice, the priest throws himself out of the window before Pazuzu can compel him to harm Regan, and dies from head injuries, thereby completing the exorcism of Pazuzu, banishing him away.

A few days later Regan, who is now back to her normal self, returns home to Los Angeles with her mother. Kinderman, who narrowly misses them, befriends Father Dyer, an old friend of Karras, as he investigates how Karras died.

==Cast==
* Ellen Burstyn as Chris MacNeil, a famous actress temporarily living in Washington, D.C., with her daughter. She is an agnostic and has a quick temper but is also a loving mother. When Regan displays strange behavior, Chris experiences an emotional breakdown and tries to find help for her daughter, consulting neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, and finally a Catholic priest.
* Max von Sydow as Father Lankester Merrin, an elderly priest and archeologist. A quiet and patient man with great faith, he has prior experience in performing exorcisms and is aware of the risks of facing evil. Jason Miller as Father Damien Karras, a troubled priest, vocational counselor, and psychiatrist. He suffers deeply when his mother dies and confesses to have (apparently) lost his faith in God. Upon taking the case of Regan MacNeil, he begins to understand the possession is genuine. Jack Nicholson was the original choice for the role, but Miller was cast after Friedkin saw his play, That Championship Season, and meeting the playwright/actor after the performance. Regan Teresa MacNeil, Chriss friendly and innocent twelve-year-old daughter.  She displays strange and aggressive behaviors after playing with a Ouija board, which are later revealed as early symptoms of demonic possession.
* Lee J. Cobb as Lieutenant William F. Kinderman, a police detective investigating Burke Denningss death. Assertive and cunning, he thinks Regan was involved in Denningss death, which may be related to the recent desecration of a nearby church. He is also a film buff.
* Mercedes McCambridge provided the voice of the demon, Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu.
* Kitty Winn as Sharon Spencer, Chriss friend and personal assistant who acts as Regans tutor.
* Jack MacGowran as Burke Dennings, an eccentric film director and close friend of Chris; his unexplained death while looking after Regan elicits a police homicide investigation. Father William OMalley as Father Joseph Dyer, a close friend of Karrass who tries to help him deal with his mothers death and reaffirm Karrass faith.
* Robert Symonds as Dr. Taney.
* Barton Heyman as Dr. Samuel Klein, a doctor who suggests that Regan needs "special" help.
* Arthur Storch as the psychiatrist.
* Titos Vandis as Karrass uncle.
* Eileen Dietz as a face associated with the demon, seen only in visions and flash cuts.

William Peter Blatty himself has a small speaking role during the scene where Chris is filming in front of Healy Hall. His character engages in a minor technical dispute with director Burke Dennings.

==Production==

===Factual basis for the film===
  exorcism performed on a young boy from Cottage City, Maryland, in 1949 by the Jesuit priest, Fr. William S. Bowdern, who formerly taught at both St. Louis University and St. Louis University High School. Hunkelers Catholic family was convinced the childs aggressive behavior was attributable to demonic possession, and called upon the services of Father Walter Halloran to perform the rite of exorcism.  Although Friedkin admits he is very reluctant to speak about the factual aspects of the film, he made the film with the intention of immortalizing the events that took place in Cottage City, Maryland in 1949, and despite the relatively minor changes that were made, the film depicts everything that could be verified by those involved. It was one of three exorcisms to be sanctioned by the Catholic Church in the U.S. at that time. In order to make the film, Friedkin was allowed access to the diaries of the priests involved, as well as the doctors and nurses; he also discussed the events with the boys aunt in great detail. Friedkin doesnt believe that the "head-spinning" actually occurred, but this has been disputed. Friedkin is not a Christian of any denomination. 

===Casting===
  The Way We Live Now.

The studio wanted Marlon Brando for the role of Father Lankester Merrin.  Friedkin immediately vetoed this by stating it would become a "Brando movie." Jack Nicholson was up for the part of Karras before Stacy Keach was hired by Blatty. Friedkin then spotted Miller following a performance of Millers play That Championship Season in New York. Even though Miller had never acted in a film, Keachs contract was bought out by Warner Brothers, and Miller was signed.

Jane Fonda, Audrey Hepburn and Anne Bancroft were under consideration for the role of Chris. Ellen Burstyn received the part after she phoned Friedkin and emphatically stated she was going to play Chris. 

Friedkin originally intended to use Blairs voice, electronically deepened and roughened, for the demons dialogue. Although Friedkin felt this worked fine in some places, he felt scenes with the demon confronting the two priests lacked the dramatic power required and selected legendary radio actress Mercedes McCambridge, an experienced voice actress, to provide the demons voice. After filming, Warner Brothers did not include a credit for McCambridge during early screenings of the film, which led to Screen Actors Guild arbitration before she was credited for her performance.   

===Direction===
 
  The French Connection. After a standoff with the studio, which initially refused to budge over Rydell, Blatty eventually got his way. Stanley Kubrick was offered the film (and later on its first sequel) but declined.

Production of The Exorcist began on August 14, 1972, and though it was only supposed to last 85 days, it lasted for 224.
 Reverend William OMalley if he trusted him and being told yes, Friedkin slapped him hard across the face before a take to generate a deeply solemn reaction that was used in the film, as a very emotional Father Dyer read last rites to Father Karras; this offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired a gun without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller for a take, and only told Miller that pea soup would hit him in the chest rather than the face concerning the projectile-vomiting scene, resulting in his disgusted reaction. Lastly, he had Regans bedroom set built inside a freezer so that the actors breath could be visible on camera, which required the crew to wear parkas and other cold-weather gear.

===Music===
  The Amityville Horror,  but he has denied this in interviews.  According to "The Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist" on the 25th Anniversary DVD release of the film, Friedkin (known for his temper) literally took the tapes that Schifrin had recorded and threw them away in the studio parking lot.
 Cello Concerto No. 1, of Polymorphia, and other pieces by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki, Five Pieces for Orchestra by Austrian composer Anton Webern as well as some original music by Jack Nitzsche. The music was heard only during scene transitions. The 2000 "Version Youve Never Seen" features new original music by Steve Boddacker, as well as brief source music by Les Baxter.
 Black Angels is also used.
 Fantasia for Strings is played over the closing credits.  

===Filming locations===
  Kurdish members of the ancient Yezidi sect, which reveres Melek Taus. Outsiders often equate Melek Taus with the Devil,  though this benevolent being has little in common with the Islamic and Christian Satan.  The archaeological dig site seen at the films beginning is the actual site of ancient Hatra in Nineveh Province.
 Georgetown at M Street NW. The stairs were padded with 1/2"-thick rubber to film the death of the character Father Karras. Because the house from which Karras falls is set back slightly from the stairs, the film crew constructed an extension with a false front to the house in order to film the scene.  The stuntman tumbled down the stairs twice. Georgetown University students charged people around $5 each to watch the stunt from the rooftops. 

The MacNeil residence interiors were filmed at CECO Studios in Manhattan. The bedroom set had to be refrigerated to capture the authentic icy breath of the actors in the exorcising scenes, while the bedroom scenes along with many other scenes were filmed in a basement at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York.  The temperature was brought so low that a thin layer of snow fell onto the set one morning. Blair, who was only in a thin nightgown, says to this day she cannot stand being cold.    Exteriors of the MacNeill house were filmed at 36th and Prospect in Washington, using a family home and a false wall to convey the homes thrust toward the steps. In fact, both then and now, a garden sits atop the embankment between the steps and the home.
  in the Bronx]] CT or MRI scanners. As was the common practice at the time, the angiography was performed by the nowadays obsolete method of direct puncture of the carotid artery in the neck. This resulted in blood squirting that caused some movie viewers to faint. The follow-on procedure, pneumoencephalography, though routinely performed from the 1920s through the 70s, was very taxing on patients and sometimes required months of recuperation. In the film Regan is shown to be in great distress while undergoing it, as actual patients often were. In the prior scene, Chris MacNeil experiences a breakdown when the doctors suggest it be attempted as the other tests Regan underwent failed to detect a brain lesion they are certain would be found.
 paleontologist on whom the character of Fr. Merrin was loosely based. Georgetown was paid $1,000 per day of filming, which included both exteriors, such as Burstyns first scene, shot on the steps of the Flemish Romanesque Healy Hall, and interiors, such as the defilement of the statue of the Virgin Mary in Dahlgren Chapel, or the Archbishops office, which is actually the office of the president of the university. One scene was filmed in The Tombs, a student hangout across from the steps that was founded by a Blatty classmate. The motion picture St. Elmos Fire (film)|St. Elmos Fire includes scenes filmed at The Tombs.

===Special effects=== Dick Smith. In one scene from the film, Max von Sydow is actually wearing more makeup than the possessed girl (Linda Blair). This was because director Friedkin wanted some very detailed facial close-ups. When this film was made, von Sydow was 44, though he was made up to look 74.  Alan McKenzie stated in his book Hollywood Tricks of the Trade that the fact "that audiences didnt realize von Sydow was wearing makeup at all is a tribute to the skills of veteran makeup artist Dick Smith."

==Alternative and uncut versions==
Several versions of The Exorcist have been released: the 1979 theatrical re-issue was reconverted to 70mm, with its 1.75:1 ratio  cropped to 2.20:1 to use all the available screen width that 70mm offers. This was also the first time the sound was remixed to six-channel Dolby Stereo sound. Almost all video versions feature this soundtrack.

In both the TV-PG and TV-14 rated network versions, the image of the obscenely defiled statue of the Virgin Mary stays intact. It stays on screen several seconds longer for the TV-14 version. On original TV airings, the shot was replaced with one where the statues face is smashed in but without other defilement.
 Morgan Creek, current owner of the franchise, is now negotiating a cable television mini-series of Blattys novel, which is the basis for the original film.

===The spider-walk scene=== deleted this scene just prior to the December 26, 1973 premiere because it was technically ineffective due to the visible wires suspending Hager in a backward-arched position as she descends the stairs. According to Friedkin, "I cut it when the film was first released because this was one of those effects that did not work as well as others, and I was only able to save it for the re-release with the help of computer graphic imagery."  Additionally, Friedkin considered that the spider-walk scene appeared too early in the films plot and removed it despite screenplay writer William Peter Blattys request that the scene remain. In the book, the spider-walk is very quiet, and consists of Regan following Sharon around and occasionally licking her ankle.

In 1998, Warner re-released the digitally remastered DVD of The Exorcist: 25th Anniversary Special Edition. The DVD includes the BBC documentary, The Fear of God: The Making of The Exorcist,  highlighting the never-before-seen original non-bloody variant of the spider-walk scene.
 CGI artists to digitally remove the wires holding Hager. The director reinstated the bloody variant of the spider-walk scene for the 2000 theatrically re-released version of The Exorcist: The Version Youve Never Seen.

In October 2010, Warner released The Exorcist (Extended Directors Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) on Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray, including the behind-the-scenes filming of the spider-walk scene.

==Sequels and related films==
After the films success, rip-off films and The Exorcist franchise sequels appeared.   was released in 1977, and revisited Regan four years after her initial ordeal. The plot dealt with an investigation into the legitimacy of Merrins exorcism of Regan in the first film. In flashback sequences, we see Regan giving Merrin his fatal heart attack, as well as scenes from the exorcism of a young boy named Kokumo in Africa many years earlier. The film was so sharply criticized that director John Boorman reedited the film for a secondary release immediately after its premiere. Both versions have now been released on video; the cut version on VHS and the original uncut version now on DVD.
 Jason Miller reprised his Academy Award-nominated role in The Exorcist for this film.
 flashback scenes were shown of Merrin exorcising the demon Pazuzu from an African boy named Kokumo. Although the plot for both prequels Beginning and Dominion centered around Merrins exorcism in Africa, they both took a significant departure from the original storyline, making no effort to be faithful to original details. For example: the African boy, though he appeared in the film was not named Kokomu, and eventually discovered not to actually be the possessed character.

In November 2009, it was announced that Blatty planned to direct a mini-series of The Exorcist.  
 Showtime on October 22, 2000, directed by Steven E. de Souza and written by de Souza and Michael Lazarou. The film claimed to follow the true accounts that inspired Blatty to write The Exorcist and starred Timothy Dalton, Henry Czerny, and Christopher Plummer.

Blatty directed The Ninth Configuration, a post-Vietnam War drama set in a mental institution. Released in 1980, it was based on Blattys novel of the same name. Though it contrasts sharply with the tone of The Exorcist, Blatty regards Configuration as its true sequel . The lead character is the astronaut from Chris party, Lt. Cutshaw.

===Other films=== Beyond the Door, a 1974 Italian film with Juliet Mills as a woman possessed by the devil. It appeared in the U.S. one year later. Also in 1974, a Turkish film, Åžeytan (Turkish for Satan; the original film was also shown with the same name), is an almost scene-for-scene remake of the original. The same year in Germany, the exorcism-themed film Magdalena, vom Teufel besessen was released. In 1976, Britain released The Devil Within Her (also called I Dont Want to Be Born) with Joan Collins as an exotic dancer who gives birth to a demon-possessed child.

Similarly, a blaxploitation film was released in 1974 titled Abby (film)|Abby. While the films Åžeytan and Magdalena, vom Teufel besessen were protected from prosecution by the laws of their countries of origin, Abby s producers (filming in Louisiana) were sued by Warner. The film was pulled from theaters, but not before making $4 million at the box office.

A parody, Repossessed, was released the same year as The Exorcist III, with Blair lampooning the role she had played in the original.

The prologue for Scary Movie 2 was a short parody of several scenes from the original.

===Other references===
A meta-reference to the film was made in an episode of Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural titled "The Usual Suspects". On the show, demons possessing humans is a common plot element; demons in the series are human souls corrupted by their time in Hell, lacking physical bodies of their own to interact with Earth. Linda Blair appeared in "The Usual Suspects" as a police detective, with protagonist Dean Winchester finding her character familiar and expressing a strange desire for pea soup at the episodes conclusion.
 Angel finds himself dealing with a priest who performs exorcisms, but comes to realize that the priest is summoning the demons for him to exorcise in the first place. He also makes a note of The Exorcist film, noting that the vision it created of possession actually made things easier for possession demons by making it harder for humans to know what to expect from a possession.

In the paranormal TV show "Ghost Adventures" visited the Exorcist House for their 100th episode of the series.  In the episode, Zak, Nick, and Aaron visit the house to see that an exorcism occurred there in the early 1900s.  The episode has been announced as one of the scariest lockdown since Bobby Mackeys.

In 2014 British Author Saurav Dutt released a book entitled "Pazuzu Unbound" which is a book set in contemporary times dealing with the demon Pazuzu but which does not deal with the original characters in the film and novel on which the book is inspired.

==Reception==
Upon its December 26, 1973, release, the film received mixed reviews from critics, "ranging from classic to claptrap." Travers, Peter and Rieff, Stephanie. The Story Behind The Exorcist , Pg. 149, Signet Books, 1974. ISBN 978-0-451-06207-9  Stanley Kauffmann, in The New Republic, wrote, "This is the scariest film Ive seen in yearsâ€”the only scary film Ive seen in years&nbsp;... If you want to be shakenâ€”and I found out, while the picture was going, that thats what I wantedâ€”then The Exorcist will scare theâ€¦ (shit) out of you." Kauffmann, Stanley. New Republic review reprinted in The Story Behind The Exorcist , written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 152â€“154, Signet Books, 1974. ISBN 978-0-451-06207-9  Variety (newspaper)|Variety noted that it was "an expert telling of a supernatural horror story&nbsp;... The climactic sequences assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror."  In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante called it "an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director Friedkins film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to live the movies they see&nbsp;... Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before." Dante, Joe. Castle of Frankenstein, Vol 6, No. 2 (Whole Issue #22), pgs. 32â€“33. Review of The Exorcist  Roger Ebert gave the film a 4-out-of-4 star review, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects but at the end of the review wrote, "I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment wonâ€™t be one, because what we get here arenâ€™t the delicious chills of a Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful experience. Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?" 

The reviews were not all positive, however. Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, dismissed The Exorcist as "a chunk of elegant occultist claptrap&nbsp;... a practically impossible film to sit through&nbsp;... It establishes a new low for grotesque special effects&nbsp;..." Canby, Vincent. The New York Times review reprinted in The Story Behind The Exorcist , written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 150â€“152, Signet Books, 1974. ISBN 978-0-451-06207-9  Andrew Sarris complained that "Friedkins biggest weakness is his inability to provide enough visual information about his characters&nbsp;... whole passages of the movies exposition were one long buzz of small talk and name droppings&nbsp;... The Exorcist succeeds on one level as an effectively excruciating entertainment, but on another, deeper level it is a thoroughly evil film." Sarris, Andrew. The Village Voice review reprinted in The Story Behind The Exorcist , written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 154â€“158, Signet Books, 1974. ISBN 978-0-451-06207-9  Writing in Rolling Stone, Jon Landau felt the film was "nothing more than a religious porn film, the gaudiest piece of shlock this side of Cecil B. DeMille (minus that gentlemans wit and ability to tell a story) &nbsp;... " Landau, Jon. Rolling Stone review reprinted in The Story Behind The Exorcist , written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 158â€“162, Signet Books, 1974. ISBN 978-0-451-06207-9 
 James Baldwin provides an extended negative critique in his book length essay The Devil Finds Work.  Director Martin Scorsese placed The Exorcist on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time.  In 2008, the film was selected by Empire Magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies Ever Made.  It was also placed on a similar list of 1000 films by The New York Times. 

===Box office===
The film earned $66.3 million in distributors domestic (US/CAN) rentals during its theatrical release in 1974, becoming the second most popular film of that year (trailing The Sting). Gebert, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards (listings of Box Office (Domestic Rentals) for 1974, taken from Variety magazine), pg. 314, St. Martins Paperbacks, 1996. ISBN 0-668-05308-9. "Rentals" refers to the distributor/studios share of the box office gross, which, according to Gebert, is normally roughly half of the money generated by ticket sales.  After several reissues, the film eventually grossed $232,671,011 in North America,    which if adjusted for inflation, would be the ninth List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|highest-grossing film of all time and the top-grossing R-rated film of all time.  To date, it has a total gross of $441,071,011 worldwide. 

===U.K. reception===

Following a successful re-release in cinemas in 1998, the film was submitted for home video release for the first time in February 1999
  and was passed uncut with an 18 certificate, signifying a relaxation of the censorship rules with relation to home video in the UK. The film was shown on terrestrial television in the U.K. for the first time in 2001, on Channel 4. 

===Audience reception===
Roger Ebert, while praising the film, believed the special effects to be so unusually graphic he wrote, "That it received an R rating and not the X is stupefying." 

Theaters provided "Exorcist barf bags". 

====Alleged subliminal imagery==== subliminal imagery. Wilson Bryan Key wrote a whole chapter on the film in his book Media Sexploitation alleging multiple uses of subliminal and semi-subliminal imagery and sound effects. Key observed the use of the Pazuzu face (in which Key mistakenly assumed it was Jason Miller made up in a death mask makeup) and claimed that the safety padding on the bedposts were shaped to cast phallic shadows on the wall and that a skull face is superimposed into one of Father Merrins breath clouds. Key also wrote much about the sound design, identifying the use of pig squeals, for instance, and elaborating on his opinion of the subliminal intent of it all. A detailed article in the July/August 1991 issue of Video Watchdog examined the phenomenon, providing still frames identifying several uses of subliminal "flashing" throughout the film. Tim Lucas|Lucas, Tim and Kermode, Mark. Video Watchdog Magazine, issue No. 6 (July/August 1991), pgs. 20â€“31,  "The Exorcist:  From the Subliminal to the Ridiculous"   In an interview from the same issue, Friedkin explained, "I saw subliminal cuts in a number of films before I ever put them in The Exorcist, and I thought it was a very effective storytelling device... The subliminal editing in The Exorcist was done for dramatic effectâ€”to create, achieve, and sustain a kind of dreamlike state." Friedkin, William. Interviewed in Video Watchdog Magazine, issue No. 6 (July/August 1991), pg. 23, "The Exorcist:  From the Subliminal to the Ridiculous" 
However, these quick, scary flashes have been labeled "  truly subliminal". {{cite web

  True subliminal imagery must be, by definition, below the threshold of awareness.     In an interview in a 1999 book about the film, The Exorcist author Blatty addressed the controversy by explaining that, "There are no subliminal images. If you can see it, its not subliminal."
