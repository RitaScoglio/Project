 Hungarian Apocalypse|apocalyptic art drama film directed by Béla Tarr. Shot in black-and-white, it runs for more than seven hours. It is based on the novel Satantango (novel)|Satantango by Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai, who had been providing Tarr with stories since his 1988 film Damnation (film)|Damnation. Tarr had wanted to make the film since 1985 but was unable to proceed with the production due to the strict political environment in Hungary.

In the years since its release, Sátántangó has received wide acclaim from film critics. In 2012, it appeared in the British Film Institutes Sight & Sound critics top 50 films.

==Plot== collective farm, Futaki (Miklós Székely B.) is having an affair with Mrs. Schmidt (Éva Almássy Derzsi), as he is awakened at dawn by the ringing of church bells, even though the nearest church had been destroyed long ago. Mr. Schmidt (László Lugossy) conspires with a group of co-workers to steal the villagers money and flee to another part of the country. Futaki ambushes Schmidt and discovers his plans, after which he demands to become part of the scheme&mdash;all of this being watched by a lonely drunk man known as the Doctor (Peter Berling), who writes the events down in a notebook. However, the conspiracy is terminated when rumors spread across the village that the charismatic and manipulative Irimiás (Mihály Vig), a former co-worker who had been presumed dead, is returning. Meanwhile, Irimiás and his friend Petrina (Putyi Horváth) make a secret deal with a Hungarian military officer somewhere else that involves his return to the village and manipulation of its community.

At the village, the Doctor discovers he has run out of fruit brandy. Unaccostumed to abandon his house for whatever reason, he decides to go out to buy liquor nonetheless. Outside, he is met with hostile weather and the arrival of the night. After purchasing his brandy, he is approached by Estike (Erika Bók), a young girl who desperately reaches out for his help. Behaving aggresively towards the child, the Doctor reconsiders and naively tries to apologize as the girl leaves and disappears in the darkness. After suffering a stroke, the Doctor collapses and is found in the morning by passing travelers who take him to a hospital.

The morning before the Doctor left his house, Estike is tricked by a fellow kid into planting a "money tree" somehwere in the wasteland. After finding out she has been deceived, Estike tries to recover her money to no avail, after she succumbs to silent despair and retaliates by torturing and poisoning a cat. Dangerously marauding in the woods, the girl approaches the local bar, where most of the villagers (including her own mother) dance to Spanish music and tango unaware of the childs suffering and behavior. Afterwards, she encounters the Doctor and cries out for his help, after which she retreats into an abandoned ruin and poisons herself.

The following day, Irimiás arrives at the village while Estikes funeral is being held. Invaded by grief, Irimiás speaks to the villagers hatefully and convinces them of handing him the money of their proposed venture in order to start a new collective farm in another city. The villagers travel separately to a distant abandoned building, where they collapse from sleep and have intense nightmares. The day after, Schmidt and Kráner (János Derzsi) threaten Irimiás with a knife and demand that he returns their money. Irimiás agrees in a manipulative way, and the villagers give their money back to him in shame. It is then revealed that Irimiás plans to murder the villagers with explosives, although it is never shown. As they travel in a truck to the city, each of the villagers is assigned a different task by him and dismissed.

The military officials receive Irimiás letters detailing the villagers descriptions, abilities and defects. Assuming their superior is likely to find them offensive and unprofessional, the officials decide to re-write them in a more polite and objective way, after which they retreat, showing no empathy for Irimiás proposed fate for the villagers.

The Doctor returns home several weeks later, unaware that Irimiás had taken the entire community with him. As he sits down to write some notes, the same bells that woke Futaki up start ringing. The Doctor decides to leave his house once more to investigate the desolate and faraway place where the church once stood, instead finding a madman in the middle of ruins desperately ringing the bells and shouting nonsensical phrases. The Doctor returns home, and possessed by nihilism and fear, covers his windows and fully surrounds himself in darkness.

==Production==

===Structure===
The structure of the film is based on that of the novel, which borrows, as its title suggests, from tango dance|tango. The film is broken into twelve parts, and does not necessarily move chronologically, as it follows the tango scheme of going six moves forward, then six back (hence 6 + 6 parts in total). The twelve parts are titled as follows (in original Hungarian and translation):

::* A hír, hogy jönnek  
::* Feltámadunk  
::* Valamit tudni  
::* A pók dolga I.  
::* Felfeslők  
::* A pók dolga II (Ördögcsecs, sátántangó)  
::* Irimiás beszédet mond  
::* A távlat, ha szemből  
::* Mennybe menni? Lázálmodni?  
::* A távlat, ha hátulról  
::* Csak a gond, a munka  
::* A kör bezárul  

===Long takes===
The film is filled with numerous long takes, a trait found in Tarrs work. Tarrs adoption of this style has led many people to draw parallels between Tarr and Andrei Tarkovsky, both of whom opt(ed) to let their films play out at a more meditative pace. According to Tarr himself, there are roughly only 150 shots in the entire film.  Many shots last up to nearly 10–11 minutes, such as several dance sequences, during which the camera rarely moves, but we see the main characters dance and drink. Tarr has said that the cast was actually drunk during these scenes.   

The opening shot, in which the camera trucks alongside a herd of cows, lasts nearly 8 minutes. There are numerous shots depicting main characters walking (and talking) for minutes at a time, unimpeded by a cut. Whereas films that feature long takes usually have many short takes to offset the long ones, this film does not.

===The book and the film===
This film is based on literary sources and had a screenplay, but much of it was still improvised on set. Tarr had this to say on the subject of having a screenplay, but on his filming method in general:

:"No, we never use the script. We just write it for the foundations and the producers and we use it when looking for the money. The pre-production is a very simple thing. It takes always a minimum of one year. We spend a year looking all around and we see everything. We have a story but I think the story is only a little part of the whole movie." 

An omniscient narrator can be heard at several points throughout the film, textually quoting parts of the novel. It also adapts every single one of the moments in the book, leaving nothing out.

===Music=== cinematographer Fred Kelemen, as "collaborative filmmaking", in which each one of their individual works stands as a relevant production of its own. As with Damnation and all of Tarrs films made after 1994, Sátántangó utilizes a small set of original compositions by Víg that play at strategic points of the film, to establish parallelisms with its themes or with situations. 
 melancholic and haunting accordion themes, reminiscent of a slow and repetitive tango. The most prominent musical theme of the film is "Rain II", which is featured at most of the films signature moments. Three tango suites play once at separate moments of the film, "Galicia" and "May I Have This Tango?" in "The Job of the Spider II"&mdash;while the villagers feast as Estike watches from outside the bar&mdash;and "Circle Dance II" after the villagers arrive at the new building that is supposed to be their farm, while the camera goes through their faces and emotions. Additionally, a sound effect-like deafening tune is used as the background for the ringing of the church bells, playing constantly throughout the film. In the 2009 compilation "Music From the Films of Béla Tarr", all of the mentioned tracks appear, and the latter is listed as "Bell I" and "Bell II." [

==Themes== pessimistic Philosophy|philosophical sociopathic conduct of Irimiás. For this reason, the Captain delivers an extended monologue about the importance of authority, quoting Pericles on the subjects of order and freedom. Some authors have judged the figure of the captain to represent a symbol of authoritarianism during the Hungarian Peoples Republic.   
 archetypical False diabolical traits to him than properly divine ones. 

Similarly, the character of the Doctor wields an important symbolic side of the films themes. Appearing as man of culture and developed interests, the old Doctor is past the point of disillusion of his village, staying indoors most of the time and behaving antisocially. The Doctor only agrees to go out after finding out he has run out of brandy, and his choice is deeply regretted when he is met with hostile weather under the cover of darkness and collapses. In "The Perspective From the Front", the villagers remember they have left the Doctor in the desolate village&mdash;although he was in the hospital&mdash;and Futakis suggestion is that they leave him behind "to starve." The Doctor seems to be deprived of the villagers indifference, in spite of his hostile behavior towards Mrs. Kráner, willing to help Estike before she committed suicide and disturbed enough to investigate the ringing of the bells in "The Circle Closes." Out of the entirety of the villages inhabitants, the Doctor seems to be the only one willing to accept death, as he chooses to starve himself in the abandoned village rather than following Irimiás. 

==Reception==
Sátántangó has gathered universal critical acclaim since its release in 1994, and particularly since the release of its director approved-DVD from Facets Video in 2006. It currently has a 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes,  with particular praise from the critics to Tarrs direction. Ed Halter commented on the films ominous and phantasmagorian dark themes, saying "Tarrs overwhelmingly bleak oeuvre makes Robert Bresson seem like an upbeat party animal by comparison." In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis lauded the directors use of long takes.  Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader has called the film his favorite of the 1990s.  J. Hoberman of The Village Voice described it as "one of the great, largely unseeable movies of the last dozen years,".  Additionally, Halter proclaimed it a masterpiece, saying "Critics have rightfully hailed Tarr as one of filmdoms criminally undersung geniuses."  Susan Sontag described Sátántangó as "devastating, enthralling for every minute of its seven hours," adding she would be "glad to see it every year for the rest of   life." In the 2012 Sight & Sound critics poll of the greatest films ever made, the film tied for 36th place,  with 34 critics having voted for it.

Among audiences, the film has developed a cult following. In part due to its artistry and length, but also because for a long time it was unavailable on   sources were available. Sátántangó is now, however, available in a new Facets Video transfer supervised by Tarr. It is infrequently screened due to its lengthy running time - although sometimes shown in two separate parts, or in its entirety with two intermissions. Tarr has said the film should be viewed without any interruption.

The scene in "Comes Unstitched" when Estike (Erika Bók) kills her cat led to some difficulties in getting the film shown in the United Kingdom, due to legislation protecting animals from cruelty and the British Board of Film Censors refusing to certify such films. Tarr has insisted that there was a veterinarian on the set at all times, and that the cat was under the vets supervision.
