Dudley Do-Right is a 1999 romantic comedy film, based on Jay Wards Dudley Do-Right, produced by Davis Entertainment for Universal Studios. The film stars Brendan Fraser as the cartoons title character with supporting roles done by Sarah Jessica Parker, Alfred Molina, and Eric Idle.

==Plot==
The story begins with three children and a horse. These are young versions of Dudley Do-Right (Dyllan Christopher), Nell Fenwick (Ashley Yarman), Snidely Whiplash (Jeremy Bergman), and Horse. The three talk of their aspirations; Dudley believes he is destined to be a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer (Mountie) while Nell wishes to see the world. Snidely, however, wishes to be the "bad guy".

Several years later, all three have fulfilled their supposed destinies. Dudley (Brendan Fraser) is now a Mountie (but always sticks to the rules and is frequently oblivious to even the most obvious of things), and Snidely (Alfred Molina) has become an infamous bank robber. After Snidely and his gang rob a bank of its money and gold, Snidely tricks his entire gang into believing he has fled with the bulk of the cash to the Sudan and going on a wild goose chase after him. Snidely subsequently salts the stolen gold and spreads it in the lakes. Dudley catches him the act, but Snidely fools him into thinking he is vampire hunting, and uses a similar tactic to scare Horse off. Not long after, Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker) returns from her world tour and reunites with Dudley. The two attend a festival at the nearby Kumquat tribe.
 Prospector Kim J. Darling (Eric Idle), the poorest man in Semi-Happy Valley, stumbles across the gold in the river and is made into a media sensation by Snidely. The subsequent gold rush boosts Snidelys popularity and he quickly takes control of the town, renaming it "Whiplash City". Eventually, Snidelys men return from the Sudan to kill him for his deceit, but Snidely convinces them otherwise by offering them lives of luxury in his new town. Dudley becomes convinced that Snidely is up to something and confronts him, but Snidely laughs him off and snatches Nell from him. Snidely sends his second in command Howard (Jack Kehler) to assassinate Dudley with a bomb, but Dudley is absent when the bomb goes off. Nells father Inspector Fenwick (Robert Prosky), who is in good favor with Snidely, discovers Dudleys feud with Snidely and discharges Dudley from the Mounties. Dudley falls into a depression and wanders across the town until he runs into a drunken Darling, who offers him shelter at his underground cave in the woods. Darling tells Dudley of Snidelys plans and newfound popularity and takes him to see a Gala Ball in Snidelys honor. Dudley comically attempts to take Nell back from Snidely, but loses pathetically.

Darling decides to put Dudley through a very harsh training regimen to make him a more formidable opponent. Dudleys first act is to intimidate one of Snidelys men into telling him the next gold shipment. Dudley sabotages the shipment and leaves his mark on Snidelys workshop as well as his favorite golf course. Eventually, Darling leaves to find his family and parts ways with Dudley thanking him for his friendship. Dudley then uses his new training to win Nell back from Snidely, who swears revenge. Snidely attempts to rally the people against Dudley, but their lingering respect for Dudley only turns them against Snidely. Snidely ultimately discovers that Dudley and Nell are at another festival with the Kumquat tribe and leads a full scale attack on them. The Kumquats flee for their lives until Horse reappears and helps Dudley sabotage Snidelys tanks by making Snidely and Homer accidentally shoot each other. A cavalry of Mounties appears and arrests Snidely and his men. Darling also arrives with his wife (Jessica Schreier) and is reunited with Dudley, revealing that they called out the cavalry. Inspector Fenwick reinstates Dudley in the Mounties.

The final scene shows Dudley and Nell living together in Dudleys rebuilt house. They share a kiss as the film closes.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert gave the film a two and a half stars rating, writing: "Dudley Do-Right is a genial live-action version of the old cartoon, with a lot of broad slapstick humor that kids like and adults wince at. I did a little wincing the ninth or 10th time Dudley stepped on a loose plank and it slammed him in the head, but I enjoyed the film more than I expected to. Its harmless, simple-minded, and has a couple of sequences better than Dudley really deserves." 

The film received negative reviews from critics.   It currently has a Rotten rating of 14% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the sites consensus stating "  gags arent that funny." 

===Box office===
