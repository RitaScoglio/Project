==Plot== mush and milk. Just as the headmistress leaves the boys sleeping quarters, Old Cap comes in to say hi to them. At that time, he promises that when he gets his back pension they will all leave that place and live well with tons of presents for the children. After the boys are up, the headmistress tells the boys to milk the cow and that they will be thrashed if they spill any.

They spill the milk and use plaster of paris to substitute the milk. They warn the other classmates, by passing a message at the breakfast table. Stymie warns his neighbor to not drink the milk ("its spoiled!"). This message is passed in this manner around all the breakfast tables. Then Spanky innocently warns the headmistress to not drink the milk, who in turn, scolds the children and demands that milk be put on their oatmeal without issue and eaten immediately. This results in the forming of a hardened plaster mix in their bowls, and leaves them banging their spoons against the "spoiled" mush and milk, in a futile attempt to do as they are told.
  slays the kids with a burning rendition of "Just Friends (Lovers No More)".]]

Then after an amusing class session of foolish answers, Cap allows them an impromptu talent show. The kids do a dance, Spanky speaks a poem, Stymie plays a harmonica, and Tommy belts out a scowling rendition of "Just Friends (Lovers No More)", complete with adult-oriented lyrics.
 French dessert, which turns out to be none other than mush and milk, which is thrown at the waiter.
