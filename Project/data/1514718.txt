==Plot==
Sean (Dr. Dre|Dre) and Dee Loc (Dogg) are roommates who have not yet paid their rent. To make matters worse, Sean has just lost his job at Foot Locker due to Dee Locs interference, so Dee Loc suggests that his roommate stop by the same car wash where he works. Sean is immediately hired as assistant manager with Chris (Eminem) having been fired the day before. At the same time, their landlord has given them a three-day eviction warning. Although Dee Loc has the money, through dealing drugs on the side, he refuses to pay, insisting that Sean needs to come up with his half, so Sean does his best to impress Mr. Washington (George Wallace (actor)|Wallace), the owner of the car wash, so he can hold his job long enough to come up with his half of the rent.

At first, things go fine, but then Dee Loc is caught on tape stealing and Mr. Washington tells Sean he must decide what to do, including firing his roommate if that is the best executive decision to make. Sean tries to appeal to Dee Loc to act more responsibly but this creates a tremendous strain in their relationship.

Then Mr. Washington is kidnapped at gunpoint by two inept and angry local thugs (one of whom is played by DJ Pooh), who are stupid enough to call the car wash with their demands unaware of caller ID, which of course reveals their location. However instead of calling the police, Sean and Dee Loc put aside their differences long enough to rescue their boss.

The crisis worsens when the former assistant manager, Chris, suddenly shows up wanting revenge on Mr. Washington for firing him, which sets up the final confrontation between all parties concerned. Chris shoots one of the kidnappers then shoots up the wash and runs out of bullets, then Sean confronts Chris and they wrestle for the gun. Sean loses the battle and falls down and just as he is about to shoot Sean, Dee Loc hops in the way to defend his friend. When Chris turns around he is confronted with a gun to his face by Dwayne (Bruce Bruce), (who is Mr. Washingtons nephew) just as the cops arrive. When all this is over Sean and Dee Loc walk off together as the credits roll.
