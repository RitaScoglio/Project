 alien organism which, if it spores, will engulf and destroy humanity. When the Carroon-creature escapes from custody, Quatermass and Scotland Yards Inspector Lomax (Jack Warner), have just hours to track it down and prevent a catastrophe.

==Plot==
The British Rocket Group, headed by Professor Bernard Quatermass, launches its first manned rocket into space. Shortly after, all contact is lost with the rocket and the three crew: Carroon, Reichenheim, and Green. The rocket later returns to Earth, crashing into an English field.

Quatermass and his assistant Briscoe arrive at the scene, along with the emergency services. Opening the rockets access hatch, they find only Carroon inside; there is no sign of the other two crew members. Carroon appears to be in shock, only able to mouth the words "Help me". He is taken to hospital while Quatermass and Briscoe investigate what happened to the rocket and its two missing crew.

It quickly becomes evident that Carroon has been altered by something he encountered in space; he can absorb any living thing with which he comes in contact. When he smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, absorbing it, his right hand and then his arm begins to mutate. Not knowing this, Carroons wife, Judith, hires a private investigator to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but Carroon then kills and absorbs the private investigator. It does not take long for Judith to discover what her husband has become, and Carroon soon flees from his horrified wife.

Inspector Lomax of Scotland Yard initiates a manhunt to find the missing Carroon. Hiding out at the London docks, he encounters a little girl but through sheer willpower he leaves her unharmed. Instead, Carroon heads for a nearby zoo where he absorbs many of the animals. By now, he has become a completely mutated creature. Quatermass and Briscoe track the Carroon-creature to Westminster Abbey, where it has crawled up on the inside and is now high up on metal repair scaffolding. From his examination of tissue samples taken from Carroon, Quatermass concludes that some kind of alien has fully taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores, endangering the entire planet. With the assistance of a television crew working at the Abbey, Quatermass succeeds in killing the Carroon-creature by electric shock|electrocution.

As he leaves the Abbey, Quatermass ignores all those who walk past him, asking what has happened, save for his assistant Marsh, who asks him what now? He replies, "We start over again". Quatermass says nothing more and leaves Marsh standing there, as he walks away into the distance of the London night.

 British Board Quatermass and the Pit (1967), making them synonymous with the genre. The Quatermass Xperiment is regarded as the first of these "Hammer Horrors".

===Development=== Hammer Films second features, British Board of Film Censors (BBFC),  restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen.  Hammer were not so reticent, deciding from the outset that they would deliberately pursue an ‘X’ Certificate.  Hammers offer met some resistance within the BBC, with one executive expressing reservations that The Quatermass Experiment was not suitable material for the company, but the rights were nevertheless sold for an advance of £500. 

Nigel Kneale was a BBC employee at the time, which meant that his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC and he received no extra payment for the sale of the film rights.  This became a matter of some resentment between Kneale and the BBC and, when his contract came up for renewal, he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work.  Despite this, Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ex-gratia payment of £3,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass. 
 Quota laws in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios interests to fund these features to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts. 

===Writing===
The first draft of the screenplay was written by Richard Landau, an American who had worked on six previous Hammer productions, including   flight surgeon.  Quatermass himself was demoted to a doctor and written much more as an action hero than the thoughtful scientist created by Nigel Kneale.  Some characters from the television version, such as the journalist James Fullalove, are omitted altogether.  Judith Carroons role in the film version is reduced to little more than that of the stricken astronauts anxious wife whereas in the television version she is also a prominent member of Quatermasss Rocket Group.  A subplot involving an extramarital affair between her and Briscoe is also left out of the film version.  Kneale was particularly aggravated by the dropping of the notion from his original teleplay that Carroon has absorbed not only the bodies but also the memories and the personalities of his two fellow astronauts.  This change leads to the most significant difference between the two versions: in the television version, Quatermass makes an appeal to the last vestiges that remain of the three astronauts absorbed by the creature and convinces it to commit suicide before it can spore whereas in the film version Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution.  Director Val Guest defended this change believing it was "filmically a better end to the story".  He also felt it unlikely that Brian Donlevys gruff interpretation of Quatermass would lend itself to talking the creature into submission. 

Having fallen foul of the censors with some of their earlier films, Hammer had an informal agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting to the BBFC for comment.  When the draft script for The Quatermass Xperiment was submitted, Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied, "I must warn you at this stage that, while we accept this story in principle for the ‘X’ category, we could not certificate, even in that category, a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences”.  The BBFC were particularly concerned with the violence in the scenes where Carroon escapes from hospital and with how graphic the depiction of Caroons transformation into the alien creature would be. 

The script was refined further by director Val Guest, who cut 30 pages from Landaus script.  One of Guests key contributions to the script was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy.  With an American actor cast as Quatermass, Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermasss title of professor.  Guest also adapted some sections of the script in response to the concerns of the BBFC.  Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC who retained a script approval option after the sale of the rights and asked Nigel Kneale to work on their suggested changes, much to his indignation.  Kneale was tasked with rewriting any scenes featuring BBC announcers to match the BBCs news reporting style.

 Gordon Jackson, Harold Lang, Lionel Jeffries and Sam Kydd, many of whom appeared regularly in films directed by Val Guest.  The Quatermass Xperiment was also an early role for Jane Asher who appears as the little girl encountered by Carroon when he is on the run. 

===Filming===
  Panic in the Streets (1950),  Guest employed a cinéma vérité style, making extensive use of hand-held camera, even on set, an unusual technique for the time which horrified several of the technicians employed on the film.  To inject pace and add further realism into the story, Guest directed his actors to deliver their lines rapid-fire and to overlap the dialogue.  A meticulous planner, he created storyboards for every shot and mounted them on a blackboard so as to brief the crew for each days scenes.  As a consequence, some members of the crew found Guests approach to be too mechanical.

===Makeup and special effects===

 matte effects.  Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the movie.  Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen.  For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey.  Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted.  Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, "There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned… absolutely nothing at all".  An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments.  Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the final shot of the film.

Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic John Brosnan said, "Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score".  Bernard went on to become Hammers most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974.  Several cues from The Quatermass Xperiment were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection. 

==Reception==
===Cinema release===
  Les Diaboliques (1954),  chose to exploit it by dropping the "E" from "Experiment" in the title of the film.  "X is not an unknown quantity" was the tagline Exclusive Films used to sell the picture to cinema managers, urging them to "Xploit the Xcitement" of the film.  On subsequent re-releases, the film reverted to the title The Quatermass Experiment. 
 West End run, taking £3,500 a week at the box office.  Timed to coincide with the broadcast of the television sequel, Quatermass II,  the film went on general release in the United Kingdom on 20 November 1955 in a double bill with the French film Rififi.  This became the most successful double bill release of 1955 in the UK.  In some parts of the UK, the Watch Committees of local councils demanded certain scenes, mainly close-up shots of Carroons victims, be removed before allowing the film to be exhibited in their jurisdictions. 
 Gothic horror Guinness Book of Records subsequently recorded the incident as the only known case of an audience member dying of fright while watching a horror film. 

===Critical response=== The Manchester War of the Worlds or Them!",  also called for "a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still, once in a while, come quick". 
 Jack Arnold... The subject could have been turned into a good film, not lacking in spice; with a bit of imagination... None of this is in this sadly English film”. 

Upon its release in the United States Variety praised the film as an "extravagant piece of science fiction. Despite its obvious horror angles, production is crammed with incident and suspense".  According to Hallenbeck, many US critics found Brian Donlevys gruff Quatermass a breath of fresh air from the earnest hero scientists of American science fiction films, such as Gene Barrys character in War of the Worlds. 

Among the critics and film historians who have reviewed The Quatermass Xperiment in the years since it release have been  s   (1982), has claimed that The Quatermass Xperiment "had an enormous, enormous impact on me – and it continues to be one of my all-time favourite science-fiction movies." 

==Legacy== Women Without Men.  Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammers films in the UK were struggling in the face of competition from television and faced closure.  The Quatermass Xperiment gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists.  From this point on, Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert.  This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammers own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s. 
 Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television.  Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens from Outer Space (all 1956). 

The Quatermass Xperiment was Hammers first film to be adapted from a television drama.  Market research carried out by the company showed that it was the horror aspect of the film, rather than the science fiction, that most appealed to audiences.  Three of the four films Hammer made in 1956 were horror films: X the Unknown, Quatermass 2 and The Curse of Frankenstein.  The enormous success of the latter of these cemented Hammers reputation for horror and the company became synonymous with the genre.  Michael Carreras later said, "The film that must take all the credit for the whole Hammer series of horror films was really The Quatermass Xperiment". 

==Video Releases==
The Quatermass Xperiment was released in 2003 by DD Video on Region 2 DVD. It contained a number of extra features including a commentary by director Val Guest and Hammer historian Marcus Hearn, as well as an interview with Val Guest, an original trailer, and a production booklet written by Marcus Hearn and Jonathan Rigby.  A Region 1 made-on-demand DVD-R, sourced from a high-definition video|high-definition master, was released in 2011  by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM. The film had been previously released on VHS cassette and LaserDisc.
