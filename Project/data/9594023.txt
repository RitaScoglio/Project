==Plot==
During World War II, an outsider, Baston Morris (Weller), comes to a tiny town looking for work at the local mill. He meets up with the towns evil employer, Pink Gresham, (Smitrovich) who abuses the men and has affairs with the women. Pink toys with Bastons plight but keeps the upper hand with his pistol and chases Baston away.

Baston then meets Pinks wife, Maggie (Baker), and spins a tale of her husbands philandering and Pinks personal involvement with Bastons affairs at his hometown in the next county.

The subplot contains stories of Maggies brother, Shep Sheppard, (Glover) who is a fundamentalist preacher that has followed his fathers misogynistic ways. Sheppard sides with Pink when it comes to laying down the law, and a hunt ensues for Baston after stories are revealed of him being an axe murderer.

Screenplay was written and director by David Saperstein (Cocoon)
