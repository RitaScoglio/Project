==Production==
Blue Hawaii was the first of three Elvis films to be shot in Hawaii, followed by   had a similar titled film in production, "Hawaii", and he was upset that Wallis had chosen such a similar name.  
 Diamond Head, Mount Tantalus, and Hanauma Bay, a volcanic crater that is open to the sea, near the bedroom community of Hawaii-Kai, a few miles away from Waikiki.   Following location filming, the crew returned to the Paramount lot to finish other scenes for the film. Presley would relax during filming by giving karate demonstrations with his friend and employee, Red West, which resulted in Presleys fingers becoming bruised and swollen. Wallis warned the female stars of the film to avoid parties hosted by Presley because they were turning up for shooting looking tired.  

Producer Hal Wallis would use the box office returns from Blue Hawaii to finance an upcoming Wallis film, 1964s Becket (1964 film)|Becket, starring Richard Burton and Peter OToole.

Presley was 26 at the time this film was released, and a not yet 36-year-old Angela Lansbury played his characters mother. Lansbury would later comment that her appearance here was one of the worst in her career.  Nancy Walters, who was cast as the older school teacher was, in reality, only 18 months older than Presley.

Much of the film was shot on location at the Coco Palms Resort on the east coast of Kauai.  The resort has been abandoned since Hurricane Iniki in 1992.

The  scenes where Chads clients stayed in a hotel and where he picked up his tour group – as well as the beach he spent time with his girlfriend – were all filmed on the property that is now known as the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki Beach.
