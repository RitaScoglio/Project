==Plot==
The film begins with Kadhirvel (Prashanth), a do-gooder going all out to get water for his village. With monsoon repeatedly failing, his village reels under drought and Prashanth runs from pillar to post to get a well dug in the village. He manages to bring Shanmugham (Mahadevan), a water-divining expert to dig a well in the village. Shanmugham along with his wife and daughter Marikozhundhu (Pooja) come to the village. Unfortunately a freak mishap kills Shanmugham and the villagers search for water continues.

To eke out their livelihood, all the villagers led by Prashanth decide to leave the village with a heavy heart to take up employment in a farm house in Rajasthan. Upon reaching the place they come to know that they have been taken as bonded labourers and there is no way out but to work there tirelessly for the next three years. They undergo physical and mental torture from the greedy landlord Thakur Dass (Vincent Asokan). A silver lining in the cloud is Swapna (Namitha), Thakurs sister. She gets fascinated by Kadhirvels heroics. The rest is how Kadhirvel fights for his men and helps them reach their village back without any danger and eventually marry Marikozhundhu.

==Production== Pooja was subsequently handed the role.  Prashanth worked for the film in 2005 simultaneously with several other projects, including ventures such as A. Venkatesh (director)|Venkateshs Petrol and Ramesh Selvans Runway, both of which were subsequently shelved.  By October 2005, it was reported that most of the films shoot was over and that the team had shot scenes across Tiruchi, Karaikudi, Gingee, Thenkasi and Rajasthan.  Cinematographer Sridhar was injured in March 2006 at the shoot of the film, when he fell off a horse he had been sitting on.  One of the songs was shot at Senji fort with 80 dancers, 10 elephants and 20 horses. 

A website run by Indiaglitz.com was launched for the film in April 2006, coinciding with Prashanths birthday.  The team then screened the completed film to then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi, at a special show at Four Frames Studios in June 2006. 

==Release== Prashanth and Karunas held up the lab processing due to non payment of their acting fees. The producer of the movie, Tiruchi Gopalji was strapped for cash and could not pay the actors. After approaching he producersâ€™ council of Tamil Nadu for help, the issue was sorted out and the Chennai distribution rights of the movie were given to Karunas.  The film subsequently ran in smaller theatres and then was re-released on 28 December to larger screens, though was only able to have a below average run at the box office.  

The film opened to mixed reviews, with a critic from Sify.com noting that the film was "average" and claimed "the film starts on a promising note but the second half peters out into a mass masala. The decent first half has a good message and looks realistic but slowly down the lane the story loses track.".  Another critic gave the film a "good" verdict, revealing "directors who make their debut always attempt to prove themselves in their very first movie itself so as to stay in the hearts of the audience, and the director of this movie too has tried out something new."  A further reviewer noted "while the first half is realistic and absorbing, the second half is so cinematic, outdated and silly that it completely negates the good things about the first half and then some."
