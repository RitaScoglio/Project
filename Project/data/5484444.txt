== Plot ==
Successful British box manufacturer Charlie Blake (Anthony Newley) meets Sara Deever (Sandy Dennis) when they both take a drivers exam in New York City. She tries to get a few answers from him, but he is the one who gets expelled for cheating. They run into each other later and go out on a date.

When they return to her apartment, Charlie meets Alonzo (Theodore Bikel), Saras older, vegetarian friend. Then Richard ( ), to send him a telegram after a week so he will have an excuse to leave.

As November progresses, however, Charlie begins to fall in love (for the first time in his life) with the unorthodox Sara. When he gets the prearranged telegram, he telephones Digby to tell him to handle an important business meeting by himself. Clem Batchman (Burr DeBenning), another of Saras projects, shows up, inciting Charlies jealousy, until Sara informs him that he just wants to introduce her to his fianc√©e, Carol (Marj Dusay).

Charlie becomes troubled by certain signs that Sara may be ill. When he asks Alonzo, his worst fears are confirmed: Sara has only a little time left. She lives as she does so that she will be remembered after she is gone. Charlie tries hard to get her to break her self-imposed rule, and believes he has succeeded. She later admits to Alonzo that, unlike all the others, she has fallen for Charlie, but wants him to remember her as she is now. Thus, when December (and a clumsy Gordon) arrives, she has secretly packed Novembers bag. Charlie reluctantly leaves, promising he will never forget her.
