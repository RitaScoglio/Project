 John Hannah, Kevin J. The Mummy which starred Boris Karloff in the title role.

Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.
 Universal Pictures also opened a roller coaster, Revenge of the Mummy, in 2004. Novelizations of the film and its sequels were written by Max Allan Collins.

==Plot== Imhotep engaged killed herself, mummified alive. scarab beetles. Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance by warriors known as the Medjay|Medjai; for all humanity would be doomed should he resurface.
 Rick OConnell is cornered. The nomads suddenly flee in terror when they hear sinister whispers, and Rick quickly follows them when the ground appears to come to life. Watching from afar, the Medjay|Medjai, watching over the Tuaregs and the Legion, decide to let the desert kill OConnell.
 Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister List of The Mummy characters#Evelyn "Evie" Carnahan OConnell|Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptology|Egyptologist, an intricate box and map which Jonathan says he found in Thebes. After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he stole it from an American adventurer, soon revealed to be Rick OConnell, who survived the desert only to end up in prison. Evelyn and Jonathan visit Rick; he tells them that he knows the location of the city, and makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there, once Evelyn saves him from being hanged by bribing the prison warden with a share in the promised treasure.

Rick led Evelyn, Jonathan, and the warden to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters led by the famed British Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain and guided by Beni, who OConnell is less than pleased to discover on the boat. Shortly after reaching Hamunaptra, the warden is killed by a scarab. The expeditions are then attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Ardeth warns them of the evil buried in the city, but despite his warning, the two expeditions continue to excavate in separate portions of the city. Evelyn searches for the Book of Amun-Ra, a solid gold book reportedly capable of taking life away, but comes across the remains of Imhotep instead. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover a chest with ancient engravings that Chamberlain deciphers as saying that any and all who open the box are cursed if Imhotep is awakened. While Beni refuses to assist them and flees, the Americans open the chest to find the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namuns preserved organs. Chamberlain steals the Book of the Dead while each of the Americans pockets a jar as loot.

At night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep. A cloud of locusts descends on the city, devouring the local diggers and trapping the two expeditioners inside the pyramid. One of the Americans, Burns, is left behind in the confusion and is attacked by Imhotep, losing his eyes and tongue. The Medjai rescue Burns, and escort the expeditioners back to Cairo, but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni, who bargains with Imhotep; the creature promises not to kill Beni in return. Imhotep absorbs the life from Chamberlain and the Americans, returning to full strength, and bringing the 10 plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. After Evelyn reveals that Imhotep referred to her as Anck-su-Namun in Hamunaptra, Ardeth and museum curator Terrence Bay hypothesize that Imhotep wants to resurrect his lover again and will do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn muses that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of Amun-Ra can kill him again. As they deduce the location of the Book, Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the lives of the rest of the group. Imhotep goes back on his word and leaves his slaves to kill the group anyway. However, Rick discovers an entrance to the sewers and they escape. Terrence sacrifices himself just to buy the others time to escape.

Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni return to Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth. Imhotep awakens Anck-su-Namun, and prepares to sacrifice Evelyn, but she is rescued after an intense battle with Imhoteps mummified priests. Jonathan reads from the Book of Amun-Ra, awakening a group of mummified warriors, who kill Anck-su-Namun. When Evelyn reads from the Book, Imhotep becomes mortal again and Rick stabs him, forcing him into the River of Death. Rapidly decaying, Imhotep leaves the world of the living, vowing revenge with the same words he carved into his sarcophagus, Death is only the beginning. While looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand. The heroes escape, although they lose the Book of Amun-Ra in the process. Ardeth rides away as Rick and Evelyn kiss and, with Jonathan, ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Benis treasure.

==Cast==
  Rick OConnell George of the Jungle was making at the box office and cast Brendan Fraser as a result;  Sommers also commented that he felt Fraser fit the Errol Flynn swashbuckling character he had envisioned perfectly.    The actor understood that his character "doesnt take himself too seriously, otherwise the audience cant go on that journey with him".    Evelyn Carnahan   A clumsy yet intelligent Egyptologist. Evelyn undertakes the expedition to Hamunaptra to discover an ancient book, proving herself to her peers. Rachel Weisz was not a big fan of horror films but did not see this film as such. As she said in an interview, "Its hokum, a comic book world."    High Priest Imhotep   One of Pharaoh Seti Is most trusted advisers, Imhotep betrays his sovereign out of love for Anck-su-namun. He is cursed and slowly killed for his treachery, but is resurrected 3,000 years later. South African stage actor Vosloo understood the approach that Sommers was going for in his screenplay, but only agreed to take on the role of Imhotep "if I could do it absolutely straight. From Imhoteps point of view, this is a skewed version of Romeo and Juliet."  {{Cite book|title=Roger Eberts Movie Yearbook 2004|author=Roger Ebert|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=2003

==Production==

===Origins=== Universal Studios Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II. Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens as a result of his preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. The script then progresses to a fish-out-of-water story when Imhotep, having regained his youthful appearance,  recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from. Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities, Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis.  Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his masters in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum. After escaping into the city sewer system, Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb. Romeros script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers. 

 , and the loss led the studio to want to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s.  Universal liked this idea so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget from $15&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million.   

===Principal photography===
Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17&nbsp;weeks. Photography then moved to the Sahara desert outside the small town of Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before completion of shooting on August 29, 1998.    The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions.    To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the productions medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours.  Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten. 

Brendan Fraser nearly died during a scene where his character is hanged. Weisz remembered, "He   stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated."  The production had the official support of the Moroccan army, and the cast members had kidnapping insurance taken out on them,  a fact Sommers disclosed to the cast only after shooting had finished.   
 Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile.  This set was   in length and featured "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras". 

===Special effects===
The filmmakers reportedly spent $15&nbsp;million of the $80&nbsp;million budget on special effects, provided by Industrial Light & Magic;     the producers wanted a new look for the Mummy so that they would avoid comparisons to past movies.  John Andrew Berton, Jr., Industrial Light & Magics Visual Effects Supervisor on The Mummy, started developing the look three months before filming started. He said that he wanted the Mummy "to be mean, tough, nasty, something that had never been seen by audiences before". Berton used motion capture in order to achieve "a menacing and very realistic Mummy".  Specific photography was conducted on actor Arnold Vosloo so that the special effects crew could see exactly how he moved and replicate it.   

To create the Mummy, Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloos face during filming. Berton said, "When you see his film image, thats him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing and you can see right through on to his teeth, thats really his face. And thats why it was so hard to do."  Vosloo described the filming as a "whole new thing" for him; "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree."  Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weiszs character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.

The Mummy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, with orchestrations provided by Alexander Courage.  The soundtrack was released by Decca Records on May 4, 1999. Like many Goldsmith scores, the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements;    Goldsmith also used sparing amounts of vocals, highly unusual for most of his work. 

Overall, Goldsmiths score was well received.  |accessdate=2008-02-12}}  Other reviews positively noted the dark, percussive sound meshed well with the plot, as well as the raw power of the music. The limited but masterful use of the chorus was also lauded, and most critics found the final track on the CD to be the best overall.     On the other hand, some critics found the score lacked cohesion,    and that the constant heavy action lent itself to annoying repetition.  Roderick Scott off CineMusic.net summed up the score as "representative of both Goldsmiths absolute best and his most mediocre. Thankfully   his favourable work on this release wins out."

==Reception==

===Box office===
The Mummy opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43 million in 3,210 theaters in the United States on its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $415 million worldwide (Domestic: $155 million; Foreign: $260 million). 

===Critical reaction===
The Mummy received mixed reviews from critics.  On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 55% rating, based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The sites critical consensus reads, "Its difficult to make a persuasive argument for The Mummy as any kind of meaningful cinematic achievement, but its undeniably fun to watch."  On Metacritic the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews" 

Roger Ebert, a film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing "There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and sometimes I was unreasonably pleased."  Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a "B-" grade and said, "The Mummy would like to make you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality."  Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects. 
 Jump Cut BFI concurred.    "If someone complains of a foul odor, you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene. Fraser, equally quick with weapon, fist or quip, may save the day, but even he cant save the picture", USA Today wrote.
