==Plot==
  and Pikachu marvel at the supernatural force, which is one of the normally introverted Torys only sources of enjoyment, and which turns out to be Deoxys.]]
A mysterious meteorite is hurtling towards the earth. During its entry into the atmosphere, it almost wounds Rayquaza, a sky guardian living in the ozone layer. The meteorite crashes into a polar zone, revealing two egg-shaped objects. The purple egg regenerates into a Deoxys and picks up the green egg. Rayquaza descends from the ozone layer to fight the invader (believing it to be an enemy). A battle ensues, destroying a nearby research site and traumatizing a young boy, scared by a stampede of Spheal, Sealeo, and Walrein. The purple Deoxys engages Rayquaza and the two take turns delivering devastating blows to each other, but the fight draws to a conclusion when Rayquaza surprises the alien Pokémon and fires a point blank Hyper Beam at it. Deoxys goes back to egg form and falls into the sea, while some researchers take the green egg with them. Beneath the sea, the injured Deoxys regenerates and waits. The green egg appears somewhere in Hoenn.

Four years later, Ash, May, Brock, and Max travel to LaRousse City, where block robots patrol the area. There they meet Tory (Toui), a boy who is afraid of Pokémon because of psychological trauma that had ensued from the stampede caused by the battle between Deoxys and Rayquaza. Tory is found to be a loner. Deoxys, which has fully healed, leaves to find the other green egg which Torys parents are testing in a lab.

In the Battle Tower, Ash mistakes Tory for a Pokémon trainer and they battle against Rafe and Sid, with Tory using Ashs Torkoal. However, Tory does not know how to handle Ashs Torkoal and they lose. Tory runs away, stopping to save a Minun which was trapped in a trash can. Later, Ash meets Torys parents and they have fun until they see a mysterious purple aurora (astronomy)|aurora, signaling the return of Deoxys.

When Deoxys begins to remove the citys inhabitants to search for the green egg using copies of itself, it is up to Ash, Pikachu, and Tory to help it find the egg. This is complicated by the return of Rayquaza, and the security robots malfunctioning, which forces Deoxys to create a force field that disables the citys power. Later, Rayquaza manages to break through the force field. Deoxys and Rayquaza then continue to battle, causing havoc in the city. The green egg is regenerated when Pikachu and Minun and Plusle charge the power generator in the lab. As the fight continues, Deoxys tackles Rayquaza into the floor. It prepares a lethal blow, but the green Deoxys arrives in perfect timing and quickly transforms into defense form saving Rayquaza from the attack. The city is filled with blocks of robots when the main robot becomes hostile, which overwhelm Rayquaza. The twin Deoxys form shields that protect Rayquaza. Seeing that the two Pokémon are willing to protect it in face of this new threat, Rayquaza begins firing Hyper Beams upon the thousands of robots.

Ash and Tory work together and ultimately manage to shut off the malfunctioning robots by disabling the main robot, freeing the twin Deoxys and Rayquaza. Rayquaza, recognizing that the Deoxys arent enemies, flies away peacefully, and the Deoxys form green and purple auroras in the sky as a goodbye to their friends, leaving to an unknown destination. Ash states that wherever they are going, at least they would always have each other. Tory, who has gotten over his fear of Pokémon, agrees and later bids Ash and the others farewell at the train station with his new friends, Plusle and Minun, on his shoulders.

The original Japanese DVD release occurred on December 21, 2004. The film was later released in the U.S. on DVD and VHS on February 15, 2005. In the UK, Studio Canal released the DVD on April 2, 2012.  It was originally due to be released on May 9, 2011, however this was postponed. This date is close to eight years after the original Japanese release and over seven years after the US DVD release, making it the longest amount of time for a Pokémon film to be released in the UK after its US release. The film, however, has yet to be released on DVD in Australia and New Zealand.

The film was released on Blu-ray (along with Pokémon Heroes on the same disc) on May 15, 2011 by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment.

This was the last Pokémon film to be released on VHS, the last to be dubbed in Quebec French and the last to be distributed by Miramax.

This was the first Pokémon film to be assigned a PG-12 rating by Eirin, but it received lower ratings elsewhere.  This is because the Japanese version of the film contains several violent scenes that were cut from the American version (and other international versions).
