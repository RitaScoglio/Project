Morgan Stewarts Coming Home is a 1987 comedy film starring Jon Cryer, Viveka Davis, Paul Gleason, Nicholas Pryor and Lynn Redgrave. The screenplay was written by Ken Hixon and David N. Titcher. The film was also released as Home Front and Homefront Riviera in some countries. The film was directed by Paul Aaron/Terry Winsor, but upon release the director was listed as "Alan Smithee", a name often used when directors ask to remove their names from a picture.

==Plot==
The film stars Cryer as the son of a Republican senator who has spent most of his life away at boarding school. An eccentric boy who is a fan of horror films, his personality does not fit in with the carefully calculated conservative image his mother (Redgrave) has designed for their family. He is brought home to help with his fathers campaign for President, and unwittingly discovers that others are setting the family up for the fall. With the help of a zany new girlfriend (Davis) he manages to save the day, and loosen up his family in the process.

==Soundtrack== The Silencers and music by Peter Bernstein, Timothy Duckworth, Bernard Herrmann, Chris Isaak, John Manikoff, and The Surfaris.
