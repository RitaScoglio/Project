What Did You Do in the War, Daddy? is a 1966 comedy film written by William Peter Blatty and directed by Blake Edwards for the Mirisch Company. It stars James Coburn and Dick Shawn.

==Plot==
A wartime outfit of U.S. soldiers is assigned to capture a village in Sicily, but upon arrival, they discover that the town has been expecting them and will willingly turn itself over to the Americans rule, provided they are permitted to complete a soccer match and a wine festival.

Romance and frivolity ensue, as a reluctant, by-the-book Capt. Cash is persuaded by easy-going Lt. Christian to go along with the locals wishes. Mistaking an orgy for an attack, Germans come to the Italians aide, but the Americans accidentally end up conquering all.

==Production==
The title of the film came to Edwards when asked the question by his son Geoffrey.  As Edwards was having marital problems at the time he didnt want to leave the United States so Mirisch Productions agreed to film the movie in Lake Sherwood, California for $5 million that included the construction of a large Italian village set.   In his study of Edwards, Myron Meisel stated that Coburn imitated Blake Edwards mannerisms throughout the film. 
 The Party was completed.

William Peter Blatty recalled that he and Edwards originally agreed to make the film grim and without comedy for the first twenty minutes.  This idea was shelved when during the scene where Captain Cash visits Charlie Company at their chow line he holds out his hand and one of the GI mess orderlys ladles beans into the Captains hand. 

== Music ==

The score is by Henry Mancini. It includes "The Swing March" and the song "In the Arms of Love".
