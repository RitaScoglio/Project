==Plot==
Beverly Hills Police Captain Andrew Bogomil, Detective Billy Rosewood, and Sergeant John Taggart are trying to figure out who is behind the "Alphabet Crimes," a series of mostly high end store robberies distinguished by their monogrammed envelopes with an alphabetical sequence the assailants leave behind. Complicating matters is the new "political" state of the Beverly Hills Police Department, headed by incompetent and verbally abusive new police chief Harold Lutz, who is doing everything he can to stay on Mayor Ted Egans good side. Unimpressed when Rosewood calls the FBI to help solve the case, Lutz holds Bogomil responsible as commanding officer and suspends him, despite Bogomils efforts to convince him that Rosewood was only following a hunch. Lutz also punishes Taggart and Rosewood by placing them on traffic duty. On the way home, Bogomil is shot and injured by Karla Fry, the chief hench-woman of Maxwell Dent. Finding out about the shooting by a news report, Axel Foley abandons his undercover duties and immediately flies out to Beverly Hills to help find out who shot Bogomil. Taggart and Rosewood agree to assist Foley because of Lutzs attempts to find an excuse to get them fired.

Posing as an undercover FBI agent to get past Lutz with the aid of Detective Jeffrey Friedman, Foley soon starts making the connection between the robberies and Dent. He first finds out that the ammunition fired at one of the robberies was designed by Charles Cain, the manager of a gun club owned by Dent. Foley has Bogomils daughter Jan use her connections as an insurance agent to find out about Dents financial dealings. Dent is robbing his own businesses on purpose in order to finance firearms transactions with an arms dealer named Nikos Thomopolis and is discreetly using Cain as the front man for his operations. Bogomil was shot because his investigation was on the correct track into the case.

Having foiled a robbery attempt at a bank depot, Foley is able to trick Dents accountant Sidney Bernstein into using his computer and discovers that Dent and Karla are planning to leave the country. Foley also learns from Jan that all of Dents businesses have had their insurance coverage canceled and are about to go bankrupt except his race track, which he is convinced is the next target. On the way to the race track, Foley solves the latest riddle sent to the police, and is convinced that this riddle was made easily solvable in order to implicate Cain as the Alphabet Bandit. However, Foley knows Cain is a patsy designed to throw the authorities off Dents trail.
 
The three arrive too late to stop the robbery and find Cains body among those killed. While Lutz announces publicly that the Alphabet Crimes have been solved, Foley notices some red mud at the stables, which leads him, Taggart and Rosewood to Dents oil field, where Dent is making his final arms deal with Thomopolis. The three get into a shootout with everyone involved in the deal. Dent confronts Foley in the warehouse, but Foley gets distracted by one of Dents henchmen on the roof above him and Dent gets away. Dent then crashes through the wall in his car and Foley shoots Dent through the windshield, sending his car down a hill and erupting in flames, after running Foley over. Karla appears and is about to kill Foley, but is shot dead by Taggart.

Just as the last thugs are about to flee, the police arrive upon the scene, along with Lutz and Mayor Egan. Lutz tries to fire Rosewood and Taggart for their insubordination, and also tries to arrest Foley. However, both Taggart and Rosewood stand up to Lutz this time and prove that Dent was the real Alphabet Bandit. They are also able to convince Mayor Egan of Lutzs incompetence, and the Mayor personally fires Lutz because he is tired of his abusive attitude towards his own men.

Mayor Egan chooses Bogomil to replace Lutz as the new Police Chief. Foley returns to Detroit, but not before he gets chewed out by Inspector Todd over the phone, after Egan called Todd to congratulate him on allowing Foley to assist them on this case.

==Production== first film. Eddie Murphy turned down the series but was willing to do a sequel.   Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer hired Tony Scott to direct due to his success with the 1986 blockbuster film Top Gun.  The film was originally to be set and filmed in London and Paris; however, the script was re-written after Eddie Murphy expressed a reluctance to film outside the United States. 

==Soundtrack== Corey Hart. Cross My The Jets (a Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Hot 100) and "Shakedown (Bob Seger song)|Shakedown" by Bob Seger (which became a   1 hit on that same chart), as well as "Better Way" performed by James Ingram. The Pointer Sisters scored a moderate hit with "Be There," their single from the soundtrack. It was the second time the sisters had contributed to the Beverly Hills Cop franchise; theyd notched a top 10 single with "Neutron Dance" from the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack. As with the first film, none of Harold Faltermeyers soundtrack score has ever been released. However, Faltermeyers 1988 album, Harold F, includes a song called "Bad Guys", which is used as part of the films score—an instrumental section of the song plays during the opening jewelry store robbery scene, and also during several other scenes throughout the film.

The soundtrack debuted at   8 on the Billboard charts and spent 26 weeks on the charts, a far cry compared to the 49 weeks spent by the first films soundtrack. Despite this, one song from the album, "Shakedown", was nominated for an Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. However, another song from the album, "I Want Your Sex", won the Razzie Award for Worst Song.
