 Brian Matthews plays the heroic camp counselor that must stop him.
 Friday the Miramax Films. Oscar winner Holly Hunter. Legendary make-up artist Tom Savini, notable for his works on Dawn of the Dead (1978), Maniac (1980 film)|Maniac (1980), and the original Friday the 13th, created the effects for The Burning.

Theatrically released in the United States by Filmways in May 1981, the rights to The Burning were eventually transferred to Orion Pictures and, later, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who currently own the film in their library. While the film didnt generate much buzz and failed to bring in the box office business of other slasher films of the time, it has since gained a cult following and reappraisal by critics.  The Burning currently holds a 100% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregate website.

== Plot ==
In 1976, at Camp Blackfoot, several campers pull a prank on the caretaker, "Cropsy". During the night they sneak into his cabin and set up a wormy skull next to his bed with candles in the eye sockets. When Cropsy is awoken by the campers banging on his window, he is so frightened by the skull that he knocks it onto his bed where it ignites his sheets and clothes. Aflame, Cropsy leaps from his bed and knocks over a gas tank, causing flames to spread through the cabin. The boys watch in shock as Cropsy, engulfed in flames, stumbles out and falls into a river.

Five years later, Cropsy is released from hospital, wearing a coat, sunglasses and hat to hide his deformities. Out of rage, he murders a prostitute by strangling her and repeatedly stabbing her in the chest with a pair of scissors. He then sets out to another summer camp, Camp Stonewater. Cropsy arrives and tries to attack a female camper, Tiger, who is searching for a baseball in the woods, but he hesitates to kill her.

The next morning, camper Sally steps out of the shower and is surprised by camper Alfred, who then runs away. Sallys screams bring Karen, Michelle, Todd, and Eddy, who catch Alfred. Michelle demands Alfred leave, but Todd talks to him. Todd learns that Alfred has no friends, and was pulling a prank on Sally. Glazer, Sallys boyfriend, later attacks Alfred, but Todd tells Glazer to cool off, and Alfred apologizes to Sally.
 skinny dip. Just as Eddy and Karen are about to have sex, Karen reconsiders, upsetting Eddy. Upon leaving, Karen discovers her clothes strewn in the woods. As she collects them, Cropsy grabs her and slits her throat.

The next morning, Michelle finds Karen has not returned. She and Todd find Eddy, who tells them she left. They discover the canoes have been cut adrift on the lake that surrounds the camp. Michelle does not believe Karen is the culprit, so some campers including Todd, Michelle, Alfred, Glazer, Dave, Eddy, Sally, Woodstock, Tiger, Barbara, Marnie, Sophie, Diane, Fish, Alan, and Rhoda go and search far away from the camp. They create a raft to collect the canoes, while other campers and counselors gather wood. Eddy, Fish and Woodstock (Fisher Stevens) board the finished raft along with two female campers, Marnie and Barbara . Alfred begins to explore, while Todd reassures Michelle that Karen is fine. Eddy and the campers spot a canoe and paddle toward it. Woodstock reaches for the canoe only to have Cropsy jump out and kill them all with his shears. He stabs Fish in the neck, Marnie in the back, cuts Woodstocks hand and hacks off his fingers, stabs Eddy in the throat, and Barbara, who is screaming and scrambling, is stabbed in the head.

Michelle starts to worry about Karen. As night falls, Glazer finally has sex with Sally, but suffers premature ejaculation. He later goes to get matches to start a fire and resume their intimacy. Cropsy appears behind Sally and forcibly shoves his shears into her chest, she fights to remove the shears but is killed. Alfred finds the spot where the couple is staying, and watches as Glazer returns. He uncovers Sally but Cropsy is hiding under Sally, Cropsy stabs his shears through Glazers neck and pins him to a tree. Alfred returns to the others. He wakes Todd and tells him about what he just saw. Todd does not believe him until he finds the bodies. He is then attacked by Cropsy, who knocks him out and chases Alfred.

Alfred is chased, while Todd chases after Cropsy with an felling axe. The campers see a raft moving towards them with no one on board moving. When Michelle approaches the raft, she discovers it is full of dead bodies, Woodstocks severed arm falls on her head while she pulls him. She screams in horror while the other campers help her. Todd appears on the nearby island and goes to them. He tells them to evacuate as the campers are scared and panicking. On the island, she rows the remaining campers – Dave, Tiger, Diane, Sophie, Alan and Rhoda towards the campsite. Meanwhile, Cropsy has captured Alfred and drags him towards an abandoned mine shaft. Todd follows nearby, eventually tracking down Alfred in the mine, where Cropsy has pinned him up to the wall with the shears through his arm.

Michelle returns with the campers and calls the police to helicopter the kids and survivors to safety. Todd looks through the mine opening for Cropsy and Alfred. When he steps across a piece of track, a mine car up on a raft rolls down, causing him to fall. He falls through a wall and discovers Karens body hanging from the ceiling. He and Cropsy struggle as Cropsy is trying to kill Todd with a blowtorch, and when Cropsys disfigurement is shown, Todd remembers he was involved in the original prank. Alfred frees himself and helps Todd by stabbing Cropsy in the back with his own shears, seemingly killing him. The police arrive, while Michelle travels by boat to find Todd and Alfred. While Todd and Alfred are leaving, Cropsy attacks them. Todd hits Cropsy in the face with the axe, then Alfred ignites his clothes with Cropsys blowtorch. Afterward, Alfred and Todd make their way out to Michelle, who brings them to the helicopter and to the hospital as Cropsys body continues to burn. The film ends with another group of teenagers telling the story of Cropsy around the campfire.

== Pre-production ==

=== Concept and creation === Cropsy legend when he was a young camper in upstate New York, Weinstein brought the idea to Cohl, who loved it.   
 Friday the 13th (1980), with Harvey Weinstein creating a five page treatment in 1979 under the title “The Cropsy Maniac” and registering it in April 1980, a full month before Cunninghams film was released. Coincidentally, at the same time director Joseph Ellison also had a film in pre-production under the title “The Burning”, but changed the name to Dont Go in the House|Don’t Go in the House (1980) to avoid confusion with Weinstein’s film. The production also bore similarities to another slasher movie in pre-production, a film that would become known as Madman (1982 film)|Madman (1982). In summer 1980, during a casting call for Madman, one of the actresses commented that her boyfriend was acting in The Burning. This prompted Madman to change its entire premise, which was built around the Cropsy legend. This change caused story alterations on Madman, and filming on that film was delayed until October 1980. Madman’s delay was costly for the film, as it didn’t get a theatrical release until January 1982. The over-saturation of genre films competing with each other was one of the unfortunate side-effects of the early 1980s slasher boom. 

Cohl told Variety (magazine)|Variety that he, Weinstein and producer Corky Burger took an early version of the script to the 1980 Cannes Film festival where it was met with positive reception, although the they rejected initial six-figure offers, hoping to land more money once the film had been shot. This was a similar approach to how Friday the 13th had earned distribution with Paramount Pictures. 

British director Tony Maylam, known for rock music documentaries in the 1970s, was hired as The Burning’s director in summer 1980. Maylam had met Weinstein and Burger while the producers worked as rock promoters. 
 conventions of Final Boy” rather than the heroic adult, and Alfred is killed by Cropsy. Other changes included an excised character named Alan, who was to be the love interest for Tiger. This version also ends with a campfire scene, but the last line is different: “...And every year he seeks revenge for the terrible things those kids did to him ... every year he kills!” 

The production company became Miramax, named after Harvey and Bob Weinstein’s parents Mira and Max, who helped fund the picture. The budget is reported to have been between $500,000 and $1.5 million, although the latter is more often cited. Cohl admitted that the fact that most of the people behind the production were relatively new to the movie business did cause some problems, and the film did go over budget — with them underestimating how much money would have to be spent on behind-the-scenes elements. 

=== Casting === Brian Matthews and Leah Ayres were cast first. Ayres already had a successful small screen career. Maylam reportedly insisted that Matthews dye his hair brown, as he didnt think he would look macho enough with blonde hair. Larry Joshua was cast as one of the kids at the camp, even though he was older in real life than either Matthews or Ayres. Like most of the cast, it was his first role, but led to a long and successful career mostly on the small screen. The rest of the cast was hired during a series of auditions. Brian Backer had appeared briefly in the teen comedy Meatballs (film)|Meatballs (1979). For some of the soon-to-be-stars, such as Holly Hunter, Jason Alexander, and Fisher Stevens, The Burning was their first big screen appearance. 
 Eyes of Jason was fully grown and was now the killer, as well as what he described as “miscommunications” with the films backers. He also said that he liked the script for The Burning more. 

== Production ==

=== Filming === Buffalo and North Tonawanda, New York. Much of the filming took place in and around existing summer camps to give it that authentic look whilst keeping costs down. The cast wore their own clothes throughout the production. Many of the cast were local to the New York area, and were aware of the Cropsy legend.   

In the interview on the MGM DVD, Savini recalls that the cast were literally queuing up to find out how they would die, making him feel like an assassin. Savini was very hands on with the production. In the opening scene where Cropsy is burned in his cabin by a young Todd and his friends, Savinis legs were the ones that were set on fire. The actual stunt of running while on fire was done by 17-year-old Reid Rondell, who tragically died doing a stunt for the TV show Airwolf a few years later. 

Savini also  didnt have much time to put together the special effects for the film. He only had three or four days to make the Cropsy make-up – the mask was created in his dressing room in-between special effects duties elsewhere on the film. In Grande Illusions, his first book on his life as a special effects guru, Savini says he based the look of Cropsy on a burnt beggar he had seen as a kid in Pittsburg, as well as text books on burn victims. However, due to time constraints, the resulting mask was more of a melt than a burn. Savini was pleased enough with what he had done that he subsequently agreed to go on a publicity tour for the film. 

Savini expanded on his Friday the 13th experience for his work on The Burning. The scene where a victim has her throat cut by Cropsy with the shears was similar in execution to the demise of the hitch hiker in the earlier film. For Cropsys demise, when the axe smashes into his face, he used for an almost identical effect in Friday the 13th. 

There has been much speculation as to why the mine system was chosen for the climactic battle between Cropsy and Todd. As an earlier script showed, it was originally meant to be a boat house at the camp, but this was switched to a cave system. Indeed, another subsequent version of the script has a scene in Cropsys lair, where he looks over old newspaper clippings. Maylam says it was changed again to the copper mine because they found bats roosting and was unsafe. 

Maylam recalls that Carolyn Houlihan, who was Miss USA in 1979, found her nude scenes extremely difficult to do. However, Carrick Glenn,  who also had a nude scene, was relaxed in front of the camera according to the director. 

Maylam maintains that he was Cropsy for about 90% of the movie, as he couldnt get anyone else to hold the shears the way he wanted (to perfect that gleam bouncing off the cold metal. 

=== Post-production === Yes knew both Maylam and Weinstein through their rock music connections. Wakeman signed up to provide the films score, which was recorded in New York. 
 1984 classic. 

Maylam has said that there was talk of a sequel at the time The Burning was wrapping, however Maylam was leery of being type-cast as a horror director and the less than stellar box office stalled the sequel’s production. 

== Promotion and release == Dressed to Without Warning The Last House on the Left (1972). Filmways originally was intent on renaming the film “Tales Around the Campire” due to its now-iconic campfire scenes, however its original title remained. The film was subsequently sold to foreign territories including Britain, Germany, France, Spain and Japan at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.   

=== Box-Office ===
In April 1981, Variety reported that The Burning would premiere on May 8 in Florida on 110 screens with a regional roll out to follow. According to Variety, the film did especially well in Buffalo, near where it had lensed. In June 1981, Variety described its performance as “sizzling”, saying “  … lit up Buffalo area screens this weekend”. The film played in three theaters and two drive-ins, bringing in an impressive $33,000. Regardless, interest soon fizzled, and the film suffered a more than 50% drop-off in box office receipts the following week. 

Despite this brief bright spot, overall box office for The Burning was initially pretty dismal. It lasted in the top 50 for only four weeks, with a take of just $270,508. Variety reported it received a “chilly reception” in  , which was at number one, and Friday the 13th Part 2 at number two. However, The Burning also opened on far fewer screens than those wider releases. 
 Final Exam The Fan Graduation Day (1981), and a successful re-release of Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The success of Friday the 13th Part 2 hampered The Burning’s attendance, as the audience flocked to the known-property. 

The Burning was re-released to American theaters with new poster artwork (showing the face with a fire reflected in an eye) in November 1982, a full year and a half after its original release.   of the film have been sold by EMI in the United Kingdom. Its last week on the chart was December 8, 1982, where it had slipped from 78 screens the previous week to just 8 that week with a final gross of $707,770. Promotional press artwork also exists under the title “Cropsy” but it is unclear when it played theaters under that title, as it was a common practice to give films multiple names in an effort to trick audiences into seeing it multiple times. According to the MPAA site it may have also played under the title “Campfire Tales.” These releases and re-releases make if difficult to find a definitive box office tally for the film. 

According to Tony Maylam the film sold well around the world, making back its $1.5 million budget. The film did very well in Japan when it was released there in September 1981. Variety reported it “... set fire to the box office” in Tokyo, making a total of $283,477 in a week at just four cinemas. It had legs, staying in one cinema for at least six weeks there. Eventually, it grossed over $1 million in Japan alone. 
 When a Stranger Calls (1979), which didnt boost its fortunes as Variety said it soon “hit the skids” with “pathetic” results. 

=== Censorship === assassination of John Lennon and the growing debate about violence in the media. The Burning was heavily trimmed to receive its R-rating. The film remained cut in the United States for nearly 30-years, until its release on DVD in 2007 with its restored scenes of gore. 

The British cinema release of The Burning was severely cut as well by the BBFC, receiving an X-certificate on September 23, 1981 with cuts to the scissor murder of the prostitute and some gore during the raft attack. When the film was accidentally released uncut on video in the United Kingdom by Thorn-EMI, the tape was liable for seizure and prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act. Thorn-EMI had unwittingly released a "video nasty", a term used to coin films judged as obscene and too violent for home rental. They tried to rectify matters by reissuing a BBFC approved version. The original uncut Thorn-EMI release is worth a great deal of money today. In 1992, the United Kingdom video re-release suffered additional cuts to the raft attack plus cuts to the killing of Karen. It was finally released fully uncut in 2002. 

=== Critical reception ===
 Time Out wrote "Suspensewise, its proficient enough, but familiarity with this sort of stuff can breed contempt." 
 AllMovie gave the film a positive review, writing, "With deliberant pacing and shocking scenes of full-on gore, The Burning delivers on the creep-out levels and would probably be better regarded if not for the boom of familiar flicks that came out after this release."  While reviewing the films 2013 Blu-ray release from Scream Factory, Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote, "  dated and sort of dull but theres some amazing gore and the new blu-ray makes it shine." 

=== DVD releases ===

The Burning was released on DVD in North America for the first time ever on 11 September 2007 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  The DVD contains several extras, including a commentary by director Tony Maylam, a featurette covering Savinis make-up effects, a stills gallery and the theatrical trailer. Despite the DVD cover displaying the R rating, the print used is the full uncut version.  Shout! Factory announced they would be releasing The Burning on Blu-ray Disc/DVD Combo Pack on May 21, 2013 under their sub-label Scream Factory.
