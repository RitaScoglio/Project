}} punky barroom singer who has a complicated, jealous but loving relationship with her older sister, Georgia, played by Winningham. Georgia is a successful, talented and well-adjusted folk music singer and a happily married mother of two. Sadie is passionate but self-destructive and untalented.

Georgia was released in the U.S. on December 8, 1995. It received a positive critical reception. Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today described the film as "a painful though sadly humorous portrait of sisterhood," and Roger Ebert said Georgia was "a complex, deeply knowledgeable story about a truly lost soul and her downward spiral" in his 3.5/4-star review.    Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said “Georgia is Leigh’s high-wire act, and her fierce, funny, exasperating and deeply affecting portrayal commands attention.”  James Berardinelli of Reel Views praised it as “a tour de force for Leigh... there are times when its uncomfortable to watch this performance because its so powerful”, adding “Georgia doesnt possess an amazingly original narrative, but what distinguishes this picture is the depth of the characters and the amazing power with which the two leads breathe life into them.”  Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said “Leigh’s exceptional performance tears you apart… we’ve never seen anything like it before”, adding that "Georgia is not an easy film, but in the American independent arena, it outperforms everything in sight.”      It was also voted one of 1995’s ten best films by Interview (magazine)|Interview, New York Post, Detroit Free Press, Los Angeles Daily News and ABC Radio Network.
