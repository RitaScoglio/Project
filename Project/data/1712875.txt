== Plot ==
The film highlights the economics behind running an Indian mafia organization. In the opening, Ajay Devgan describes the modus operandi of underworld: 
 "Despite anybody telling anything else, in this world everything is done for profit, so is this business. We dont pay taxes, neither do we keep accounts; For this work is done by inducing fear. Anybody can join us anytime, but can never resign. Whoever breaks our law, is broken by us. Here friendship, respect or honesty, the only real reason behind all these is same thing &mdash; Profit." During murder/extortion scenes following, Ajay Devgan adds "profit happens &mdash; like this, like this or like that." 

The story revolves around a young man named Chandu (Chandarkant Nagre) (played by Vivek Oberoi) joining the world of crime in the Mumbai underworld to "make it big" someday. Gradually he learns tricks of the trade and increases the gangs earnings and profits. This leads to his affinity with Malik (Ajay Devgan) who is the leader of the gang.

The film features one cold-blooded murder scene wherein Malik and Chandu kill Saeed and his brother Anis in the rear seat of the car on a chilling rainy day. Thereafter Malik goes on a bloody rampage killing all his opponents, to take the reins of underworld in his hands. In this stage, Malik says a prominent dialogue "Saab ganda hai par dhanda hai ye" (Thing are dirty but its business).

His rival gang leader and colleague under Aslams umbrella Sharma, who was in a meeting with police inspector Rathod, is killed off. Inspector Rathod, who once tortured and abused Chandu in jail in early days, is killed at Maliks permission.
 hero refuses Bolivian partners killing expert to stop the bomb explosion arranged by him and thus digs his own grave.) Chandu stops the deliberate vehicle crash and falls from Maliks favor. The contract was from a politician who tries to use Maliks gang to eliminate a front-runner, a contender for Home Ministers post. The assassination (a staged truck-car collision) takes place in spite of Chandus emotional misdemeanor since Malik, not relaying on Chandu anymore, gives direct orders.
 Commissioner of IPS (Mohanlal) uses the rift to bring the mafia under control. Chandu and Malik end up becoming bitter enemies. After Chandus retaliation of the assassination of his lifelong friend of one of lieutenants Warsi, two factions of Mumbais once most powerful gang Company went to a full-scale war.

Malik and Chandu killed as many members of each opponent gangs as possible. Sreenivasan, as the police chief of murders due to the war, became criticized greatly. But he and his men knew this war ultimately is shortening the to-do list of his department. Big numbers of button men and lieutenants from the gangs were being killed. The war results in an intense chase sequence shot in Kenya where Malik hires hitmen to kill Chandu.

Chandu survives, though he is injured severely. Sreenivasan convinces Chandu to come back to Mumbai and fight his war with Malik by helping the police bring the mafia under control.

In the climax, Chandu kills the politician (the mastermind of the contract killing) in prison. At the same time, one of Chandus aides, Koda Singh, who swore revenge to kill who went against his friend Chandu, shoots Malik point blank to death in Hong Kong.

Chandu and Malik came to a truce but Chandu never withdrew his order to Koda to kill Malik. Its not confirmed that whether Chandu has forgotten to withdraw his orders or deliberately kept that on. After the assassination, Sreenivasan notified Chandu and Chandu became tremendously shocked at this news. 

Koda Singh was arrested by Hong Kong police on that day. The ends shows Chandu spending the rest of his life in prison after being persuaded by the Police Commissioner to surrender.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Company received universal critical acclaim. Alok Kumar of Planet Bollywood gave the movie 9.5 stars out of 10, saying that "Varma has brought his audience yet another innovative and enjoyable film. Company should prove to be a sound investment of time and effort for all those involved." 

Arpan Panicker of Full Hyderabad gave the movie an 8.0 rating (out of 10) and commented that "With powerful performances, especially from the three lead actors, Company turns out to be a masterpiece you wont forget in a hurry." 

N.K. Deoshi of ApunkaChoice.com gave 4 out of 5 stars, calling Company "a sleek, fast-paced thriller replete with violence and authentic Mumbai lingo." 

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 3 stars out of 5, saying that "On the whole, COMPANY is amongst Ramgopal Varmas finest works. A stylishly narrated tale, the film will win plaudits and reap a rich harvest at the box-office for its hard-hitting content." 

Ziya us-Salam of IdleBrain gave a "thumbs-up" rating and said, "Watch Company for three reasons. Varma. Mohan Lal. Vivek Oberoi. Mohan Lal in his maiden Hindi film venture, is a class act. As a South Indian cop, his accent comes in handy. Nothing overboard, everything poised about him. Limited dialogues limitless gestures. Then watch Company for Vivek Oberoi. A star son of sorts - character artiste Suresh Oberoi is his father - never once does he give you an impression that he is making his debut here. His gaunt frame, hollow cheek bones and restlessness go well with his role of a new entrant into the underworld who knows no fear, respects no reputations and lives only on some tacit principles."

==Resemblances with real-life D-Company events==
 Chotta Rajans Dawood after Rajans mentor and boss Bada Rajan died in the early 1980s.
 Dawood Ibrahims aide Chotta Shakeel gave to Indian journalist Sheela Bhatt, after an assassination attempt on Chotta Rajan in Bangkok in 2000. 

Company shows how the Hindi film industry went into trouble after violent split between Chandu and Mallik. Another interview of Chotta Shakeel which was given to the Times of India describes the intense circumstance inside the Mumbai film industry due to gang disputes. It appears that depiction of a dispute in Company &mdash; where fictional film star Naved Khan falls between Malliks and Chandus disputing gangs and becomes immensely confused &mdash; is a reference to a notable interview when Chotta Shakeel almost leaves a clarification of underworlds finance in Indian film industry. 
 
The role of Vilas Pandit, the closest aide of Malik who appeared to be the consigliere of Maliks gang, is believed to be a depiction of real-life D-Company aide, counselor and Dawood Ibrahims confidant Sharad Shetty. After the split between Dawood and Rajan, Shetty was one of very few Hindus left in the mainstream D-Company. Here it can be stated that the fate of Shetty was correctly perceived in Company. Company showed Vilas Pandit was shot to death by Chandu in Hong Kong when Pandit went to Chandus place for an unprecedented meeting; Chandu misinterpreted his appearance as an attempted hit. Real-life D-Company counselor Sharad Shetty, too, was killed outside a Dubai nightclub, by a hit carried out by Chotta Rajan. Ironically this real-life hit was carried out eight months after the release of Company which depicted a similar incident in the adopted storyline.
