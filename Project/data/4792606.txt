== Plot ==
 Samoan boys: ladies man Michael, party boy Sefa, good boy Albert, and weird Stanley, who although they are in their mid 20s to early 30s have a reputation for behaving immaturely at special occasions such as family weddings. After four particular incidents (Michael having sex with one of the bridesmaids in the wedding limousine; Albert dropping the bride while she was hoisted up on his shoulder; Sefa getting drunk and passing out while going through the wedding cake and the table; and Stanley setting a reception hall on fire), the local minister of their Samoan church rules that the four are to be banned from the wedding of Michaels brother, Sione.

This is hard news for the boys, especially since Michael was supposed to be the best man, however Albert comes up with a solution - bring a date to the wedding. He proposes to the minister that being with a girl at the wedding would force the men to be on their best behaviour. The minister allows them to go but requires that the boys must have a serious relationship with their dates or Eugene (the groom at the wedding where the reception hall burned) will forcibly block them. While the boys think its an easy plan, they soon realise that finding a girlfriend isnt as easy as it looks, especially since the wedding is just one month away.
