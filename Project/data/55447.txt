==Production==

===Writing===
Lucas has stated that he conceived the Star Wars sagas fundamental story in the form of a basic plot outline in 1973. He later made it clear, however, that at the time of the sagas conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points throughout the series, and these would evolve over time. Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, John Knoll and Roger Guyett,    He began working on Episode III even before the previous film,  , was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets.  Lucas reviewed the storyline that summer and radically re-organized the plot.  Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, surmises that Lucas found flaws with 
Anakins fall to the dark side, and made massive story changes. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the films first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action that signals his descent to the dark side. 

A significant number of fans speculated online about the films subtitle; rumored titles included Rise of the Empire, The Creeping Fear (which was also named as the films title on the official website on April Fools 2004), and Birth of the Empire.    Eventually, Revenge of the Sith also became a "guessed title" that George Lucas would later announce to be true.    The title is a reference to Revenge of the Jedi, the original title of Return of the Jedi; Lucas changed the title scant weeks before the premiere of Return of the Jedi, declaring that Jedi do not seek revenge. Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary,  . 
 Kamino from expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil.

Lucas had originally planned to include even more ties to the original trilogy, and wrote early drafts of the script in which a 10-year-old Han Solo appeared on Kashyyyk, but the role was not cast or shot. He also wrote a scene in which Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he created him from midichlorians, and is thus his "father," a clear parallel to Vaders revelation to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back, but Lucas ejected this scene as well.

After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more changes in Anakins character, sharpening Anakins motivations for turning to the dark side. Lucas accomplished this "rewrite" through editing the principal footage and filming new scenes during Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups in London in 2004. Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD documentary Within a Minute,  .  In the previous versions, Anakin had a myriad of reasons for turning to the dark side, one of which was his sincere belief that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic. Although this is still intact in the finished film, by revising and refilming many scenes, Lucas emphasized Anakins desire to save Padmé from death. Thus, in the version that made it to theatres, Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padmé.

===Art design===
After the screenplays earliest draft was submitted, the art department began designing the various ways that each element could appear on screen.
 CGI versions known as "animatics". Ben Burtt would edit these scenes with Lucas in order to previsualize what the film would look like before the scenes were even filmed.  The pre-visualization footage featured a basic raw CGI environment with equally unprocessed CGI characters performing a scene (typically an action sequence). Steven Spielberg was also allowed to assist both the art and pre-visualization departments designs for several action sequences in Revenge of the Sith.  Later, the pre-visualization and art department designs were sent to the production department to begin "bringing the film out of the concept phase"  by building the various sets, props and costumes. To determine the required sets, Lucas analyzed each scene with the staff to see which moments the actors would come in most contact with the set, warranting the set to be constructed.

===Filming===
Although the first scene filmed was the final scene to appear in the film (shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000), We Didnt Go to the Desert to Get a Suntan Episode II DVD Special Feature,  .  principal photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at   in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket Province|Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting at the same time that Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar. 
 Roger Barton, who was on location in Sydney, Australia cutting the climactic duel. All other footage was forwarded to lead editor Ben Burtt at Skywalker Ranch in California.

Actors Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel long before Lucas would shoot it. They trained extensively with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. As in the previous two prequel films, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles. Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD documentary Its All for Real: The Stunts of Episode III,  .  The speed at which Anakin and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Anakin after applying an armlock in the duels first half. Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, John Knoll and Roger Guyett,  . 

Revenge of the Sith eventually became the first Star Wars film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film. As Christensen recounted, it was originally intended to simply have a "tall guy" in the Darth Vader costume. But after "begging and pleading" with Lucas, the Vader costume used in the film was created specifically to fit Christensen. The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit.    It also required Christensen (who is   tall) to look through the helmets mouthpiece.   

===Visual effects===
The post-production department began work during filming and continued until weeks before the film was released in 2005. Special effects were created using almost all formats, including model work, CGI and practical effects. The same department later composited all such work into the filmed scenes—both processes taking nearly two years to complete. Revenge of the Sith has 2,151 shots that use special effects, a world record. 

As the DVD featurette Within a Minute illustrates, the film required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone.   Members of Hyperspace, the Official Star Wars Fan Club, received a special look into the production. Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during the time it was operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.   

===Deleted scenes===
During the process of shaping the film for its theatrical release, Lucas and his editors dropped many scenes, and even an entire subplot, from the completed film.

Lucas excised all the scenes of a group of Senators (including Padmé, Bail Organa, and Mon Mothma) organizing an alliance to prevent the Chancellor from receiving any more emergency powers. Though this is essentially the Rebel Alliances birth, the scenes were discarded to achieve more focus on Anakins story.   The scene where Yoda arrives on Dagobah to begin his self-imposed exile was also cut, but is featured in a deleted scene in the DVD release, although McCallum stated he hopes Lucas may add it to the release if Lucas releases a six-episode DVD box set. 

Many scenes concerning Jedi deaths during the execution of Order 66 were cut. The deaths of Barriss Offee and Luminara Unduli were either cut from the film or not filmed in the first place.

Bai Ling filmed minor scenes for the film playing a senator, but her role was cut during editing. She claimed this was because she posed for the June 2005 issue of Playboy, whose appearance on newsstands coincided with the films May release. Lucas denied this, stating that the cut had been made more than a year earlier, and that he had cut his own daughters scenes as well.   

=== Music ===
  Sony Classical on May 3, 2005, more than two weeks before the films release. The music was composed and conducted by John Williams (who composed and conducted the score for the other five films in the Star Wars saga), and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices.  A music video titled A Hero Falls was created for the films theme, "Battle of the Heroes", featuring footage from the film and was also available on the DVD. 

The soundtrack also came with a collectors DVD,  , at no additional cost. The DVD, hosted by McDiarmid, features 16 music videos set to remastered selections of music from all six film scores, set chronologically through the saga. {{Cite web|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050316210453/http://starwars.com/episode-iii/release/publishing/news20050315.html|

===Leaked workprint===
A copy of the film leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it may have come from within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening.    Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a copy of the film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges.      The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.   
 Presbyterian Church. The mis-translation also caused the word "fuck" (a mis-translation of "work") to appear four times in the subtitles, and rendered Darth Vaders cry of "Noooooooo" (不要) as "Do not want."       This last translation error would later be popularized as an internet meme.   

===Rating=== original trilogy changes in the re-released versions and once again received PG ratings. When Revenge of the Sith was released in Canada, it was given a PG rating in most provinces, excluding Quebec, where it was rated G. In the United Kingdom it received a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). In Australia, the film was rated M for mature audiences by the Australian Classification Board (ACB), similar to PG-13.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD on October 31, 2005 (Halloween) in the United Kingdom, on November 1, 2005 in the United States and Canada and on November 3, 2005 in Australia. It was also released in most major territories on or near the same day.    The DVD was a two-disc set, with picture and sound mastered from the original digital source material.

 
The DVD included a number of documentaries including a new full-length documentary as well as two featurettes, one which explores the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker as the Chosen One, the other looking at the films stunts and a   of web-documentaries from the official web site. Like the other DVD releases, included is an audio commentary track featuring Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, animation director   along with a trailer for the   PC game was featured on the second disc.

Also, a special two-pack exclusive, sold only at Wal-Mart stores, included another bonus DVD, The Story of Star Wars.

This release is notable because, due to marketing issues, it was the first Star Wars film never to be released on VHS in the United States.  However, the film was released on VHS in Australia, the U.K. and other countries in the world. 

The DVD was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Film review site Rotten Tomatoes calculated an approval rating of 80% based on 253 reviews, making it the prequel trilogys highest-rated film and the third-highest-rated film of the entire Star Wars saga: The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Return of the Jedi are rated 57%, 67%, and 79% respectively, while A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are rated 93% and 96% respectively.

Some critics considered it the best of the prequels,  while other reviewers judged it to be the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. A. O. Scott of The New York Times concluded that it was "the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed," and equal to The Empire Strikes Back as "the richest and most challenging movie in the cycle".    In a 2007 summary of the   on Rotten Tomatoes, Revenge of the Sith was placed 51 out of 100, making it the only prequel film in the Star Wars series to earn a ranking. Jonathan Rosenbaum, a critic who disliked A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, gave the film a positive review saying that it had a "relatively thoughtful story." Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3½ stars out of four, writing "If   got bogged down in solemnity and theory in "Episode II: Attack of the Clones", the Force is in a jollier mood this time, and "Revenge of the Sith" is a great entertainment." 

In 2012, art critic Camille Paglia praised the film in Glittering Images, comparing some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it the greatest work of art in recent memory.  Paglia explained, "The long finale of Revenge of the Sith has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than anything by the artists you name. Its because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. Its like the emperors new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off. Episode III epitomizes the modern digital art movement, more so than other piece from the last 30 years. I had considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book, but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness of Lucass Revenge of the Sith." 
 romantic scenes, Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.   
 conservatives criticized liberal bias administration and the Iraq War. Some websites went so far as to propose a boycott of the film. Lucas defended the film, stating that the films storyline was written during the Vietnam War and was influenced by that conflict rather than the war in Iraq. Lucas did note, however, that "The parallels between Vietnam and what were doing in Iraq now are unbelievable".

=== Novelization === 
 
The films novelization was written by   comic book series, such as the   (Volume 3). In addition to this, the siege of the Jedi Temple is much more violent and far more graphically explained than the cinematic version. Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith - Novelization, 1st edition hardcover, 2005. Matthew Woodring Stover, George Lucas, ISBN 0-7126-8427-1 

Some unseen or unheard-of elements to the Revenge of the Sith story were fleshed out in the course of the novel. Such examples include more discussions between Anakin and Palpatine, in which Palpatine explicitly says that Darth Plagueis was his master; in the film, it is merely hinted at. Additionally, it is revealed that the primary reason for Anakins outrage over not becoming a Jedi Master is that only Masters have access to the holocrons in the Temple Archives, which is where Anakin had hoped to find information about how to prevent Padmes death. Not only is Saesee Tiin revealed to be a telepathy|telepath, but his horn, lost in the Clone Wars, is revealed to have grown back. The book explains that Palpatine purposely manipulated the Council into sending Obi-Wan to fight General Grievous, because he knew he needed to get Obi-Wan off Coruscant before he could turn Anakin to the Dark Side - this later proved necessary when Anakins reaction to learning that Palpatine is the Sith Lord is to think "If only Obi-Wan were here - Obi-Wan would know what to say. What to do. Obi-Wan could handle this. Right now,   knew he  ." The novel also reveals Mace Windus rationale for not bringing Anakin along to the fight with Palpatine - he could sense Anakins fear and distress, and did not believe he was in any mental state to be fighting a Sith Lord. These are a few examples of many descriptions of characters feelings and inner narrative. There are even some humorous lines added in, including extra dialogue in the battle between Grievous and Obi Wan — Grievous says, "I was trained by Count Dooku," and Obi-Wan replies, "What a coincidence; I trained the man who killed him". 

=== Video game ===
  cut scenes from the film, or entirely new scenes for the game.  The style of the game was mostly lightsaber combat and fighting as Obi-Wan or Anakin.    It also has a form of multiplayer mode, which includes both "VS" and "Cooperative" mode.  In the first mode, two players fight with characters of their choice against each other in a lightsaber duel to the death. In the latter mode, two players team up to combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.
