Aiki (styled as AIKI) is a film about a martial artist in a wheelchair. The film is from Japan and was released in 2002. It is loosely based on the life of a Danish practitioner of the Roppokai branch of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, Ole Kingston Jensen, who started training in Daitō-ryū after he was handicapped in an accident and now is the highest ranking non-Japanese member of the Roppokai.
