}} Mutual Film Corporation in 1916 in film|1916. Released on June 12, it starred Chaplin as the fireman and Edna Purviance as the daughter to Lloyd Bacon.

==Plot==
A young girls father (Bacon) arranges with the local fire chief (Campbell) to have his house burn down so he could collect on the insurance money.

However, a real fire breaks out elsewhere in the town. The firemen ignore an inhabitant of the burning building as he tries to alert them to the fire, first by activating the fire alarm, then by phoning the fire station, and then by going to the fire station in person.  Eventually, a fireman (Chaplin) alerts the fire chief and the fire company goes to put out the fire.

The father than realizes that his daughter is still in his own burning building, and the same heroic fireman climbs the outside of the building to save her.

==Production background==
The film shows some early morning street scenes in the surrounding Los Angeles area.

The film makes use of reversing the film several times for comic effect: sliding up the firemans pole, reversing the horses, hurrying back to station (in reverse) when he forgets the crew etc.  The huge water tank in the station also comically has a second function as the coffee machine.  A lot of the kicking in the film is clearly unfaked and fairly violent.
