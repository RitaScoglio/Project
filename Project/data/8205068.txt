}} Japanese science Koji Hashimoto and produced by Toho. The script was adapted by pioneering science-fiction author Sakyo Komatsu from his novel Sayonara Jupiter (novel)|Sayonara Jupiter (1982). The special effects were directed by Koichi Kawakita.

Cast with a mix of actors speaking English, French and Japanese, the film was conceived by Toho as a rival to the forthcoming box office blockbuster hit 2010 (film)|2010. The two films bear comparison of plot elements.

This was actor Akihiko Hiratas final film role. He was set to star in The Return of Godzilla (1984), but died of throat cancer before he was cast.  In one scene, Captain Hoger Kinn watches Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, which featured a much younger Akihiko Hirata.

==Plot==
Its the 22nd Century (2125 AD), and mankinds population has exponentially expanded beyond Earths handling. Therefore, humans now live throughout the Solar System and the total population has gone well over 18 billion. As a result, theres a severe energy crisis for planets further out from the sun and plans to turn Jupiter into a second sun have been set into motion. However, markings are found on Mars that indicates that alien life lives in Jupiter and the J.S. Project (Jupiter Solarization Project) is put on hold.

Meanwhile, rogue members of the radical environmentalist group Jupiter Church attempt to sabotage the J.S. Project. In an ironic twist of fate, the head engineer of the J.S. Project, Eiji Honda, discovers that his ex-lover Maria is one of the radicals planning on sabotaging the project. At the same time, a satellite carrying two crew members is destroyed by a black hole heading straight to the center of the Solar System. This black hole could destroy humanity in one fell swoop once it collides into the sun. However, Jupiter is near the black holes path. The engineers of the J.S. Project decide to change their plan and shoot Jupiter into the black hole, thereby altering the holes path and potentially save the galaxys inhabitants. However, time is short....
