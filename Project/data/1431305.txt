==Plot== conductor whose heart attack on stage at the end of a performance, he retires indefinitely to Norrland in the far north of Sweden, to the village where he endured a terrible childhood of bullying.
 minister offers him the position of cantor (church)|cantor. He accepts and sees the choir grow and develop, rediscovering his own joy in music.

Almost immediately, Lena (Frida Hallgren), an attractive young girl in the choir, catches his attention. As they grow closer and fall in love, he realises that he is surrounded by the villagers personal problems. Inger (Ingela Olsson), is married to the respected minister, Stig (Niklas Falk), but has failed to develop a loving sexual relationship with her husband. Siv (Ylva Lööf), is so obsessed with morality that she cannot enjoy herself. Arne (Lennart Jähkel), is so ambitious for the choirs success that he obsesses over tiny mistakes, failing to see that he is making bigger mistakes himself. Tore (André Sjöberg), is mentally handicapped and shunned but is eventually included in the choir; Holmfrid (Mikhael Rahm), has put up with being called "Fatso" by Arne since childhood and eventually stands up to him.  Gabriella (Helen Sjöholm), is beaten and abused by her husband, Connie (Per Morberg), a fact that is known and ignored by the whole village. She eventually finds the strength to leave him, as the whole village finds its strength to help her. Connie himself turns out to be the bully who was at school with Daniel and drove him from the village. He blames the choir and Daniel for his wifes decision and beats him up. This lands Connie in jail. The minister, Stig, is jealous of the choirs success and tries to close it down. His failure precipitates his eventual nervous breakdown.
Heart after heart opens, as it had always been Daniels dream. 

The choir is accepted into the annual "Let the Peoples Sing" competition, and they journey to Innsbruck, Austria to perform. Lena fears Daniel will leave her for his sophisticated friends from the music world. They argue, make up and then make love. On the day of the competition, the choir is ready on stage but Daniel is nowhere to be seen. His heart has been affected by his anxiety, and he has another heart attack. Daniel staggers into the restroom, unsure of how to handle the situation, then stumbles and hits his head on the pipe below a sink, causing him to bleed severely.

He lies helplessly on the tile, blood gushing from his head, listening to the choir harmonising over the loudspeakers. The audience in the auditorium is enchanted and sings along. Daniel smiles to himself leaving the viewer to decide his fate, completely fulfilled by reaching his goal.

The final scene shows Daniel rushing towards his younger self as he embraces his lifes goal, to "create music that will open a persons heart".
