}} The Three The Four Musketeers. Like the other two films, the screenplay was written by George MacDonald Fraser.

The character of Mordaunt, Milady de Winters son in the original novel, is replaced by Miladys daughter, called Justine de Winter.
 Louis XIII Cyrano de Bergerac.

While filming was taking place in September 1988, character actor Roy Kinnear died following an on-camera accident in which he fell off a horse.  His role was completed by using a stand-in, filmed from the rear, and dubbed-in lines from a voice artist.

==Plot==
Twenty years after the events of The Four Musketeers, Cardinal Mazarin has imprisoned the Duke of Beaufort. Mazarin hires dArtagnan to bring together Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, to work for him. Porthos accepts, but Athos and Aramis decline. By this time, Athos has a son named Raoul.

Milady de Winters daughter, Justine, questions the headsman that the musketeers hired to kill her mother.  After finding out from the headsman that "Comte de la Fere" hired him, she kills the headsman. Raoul, who was in love with her before witnessing this event, leaves her and tells dArtagnan, Porthos, and Athos that Justine wants to kill them.

Count de Rochefort helps Beaufort escape from his prison, and is subsequently arrested by Mazarin.  Mazarin sends dArtagnan and Porthos after Beaufort, but Beaufort escapes them due to interference from Athos and Aramis, who are working for Beaufort. This starts a fight amongst the musketeers, in which dArtagnan slices Aramis hand. Aramis breaks his sword and rides away. dArtagnan and Porthos are fired by Mazarin for not catching Beaufort.

Rochefort goes into hiding until he finds Justine, and tells her the names of dArtagnan, Porthos, and Aramis, revealing to her that "Comte de la Fere" is Athos.

King Charles I of England is to be executed, so Queen Anne of Austria sends dArtagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Raoul to rescue him. They attempt a rescue by knocking out the headsman, however Justine takes his place and executes Charles.

The musketeers have several encounters with Justine: in one, Raouls true allegiance is revealed to her; in another, Justine and Rochefort attempt to kill the musketeers by blowing up their ship but the musketeers escape and Rochefort is killed.

Justine attempts to kill King Louis XIV, but is stopped by the musketeers, and their battle concludes with Justine jumping out the window into the water. Aramis rejoins the musketeers, and they force Mazarin to sign several forms in favour of them, including making Porthos a baron, Aramis a bishop, and Raoul commissioned in the guards. The film ends with the Musketeers riding together again.

==Production==
The film was shot in Spain. 

Roy Kinnear was accidentally killed during production. The Spanish crew misunderstood the instructions of director Lester and washed down the cobblestone street prior to filming, making the stones wet. When Kinnear and other cast members rode into the shot on horses and stopped, Kinnears horse slipped, and Kinnear fell off, breaking his pelvis.  He died of a heart attack while receiving treatment at a hospital in Spain following the accident.  George MacDonald Fraser, The Lights On at Signpost, HarperCollins 2002 p12-16
