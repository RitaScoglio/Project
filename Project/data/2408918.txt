 science fiction strip of British comic 2000 AD. It was a critical and commercial disappointment.

== Plot == Judges whose Joseph Dredd Herman "Fergee" hacker recently released from prison, is caught in the firefight and hides inside a food dispensing robot, only to be arrested by Dredd and again sentenced to five years imprisonment.
 Rico (Armand defense lawyer Chief Justice Fargo (Max von Sydow) and Judge Griffin (Jürgen Prochnow). Dredd is found guilty based on DNA evidence: The Lawgiver encodes the DNA of the wielder onto each round fired, and the DNA from the murder weapon matches Dredds.
 frame Dredd for the murder, succeeds Fargo as Chief Justice and instructs Rico to sow chaos throughout the city.
 Aspen penal cannibalistic scavengers who capture Dredd and Herman. A squad of Judges track Dredd to the Angels camp and a battle ensues. Fargo arrives just in time to save Dredds life, but is mortally wounded by Mean Machine Angel (Chris Adamson). While dying, Fargo reveals that Dredd is the result of the Janus project, an experiment in genetic engineering intended to create the perfect Judge, wherein DNA from the Council Judges was combined to create two human cloning|clones: Dredd and Rico. Both were given artificial memories of childhood, and they became close friends. Dredd was forced to judge Rico for murdering civilians, but Rico was sent to Aspen by Griffin. Because he and Rico share DNA, Dredd deduces that Rico framed him for the reporters murder. Fargo concludes that Griffin is trying to reactivate the Janus project, and begs Dredd to stop him.

In Mega-City One, Rico creates panic by assassinating 108 Judges in two days. Griffin uses this to convince the Council Judges to unlock the Janus files, hoping to create an army of perfect Judges to take control of Mega City-One; but when they refuse to reactivate the program, he has Rico kill them. Arriving immediately after this, Dredd and Herman are accused by Griffin of murdering the Council. They evade the Judges and seek help from Hershey, who has been investigating Dredds past. Dredd tells her about the Janus project, and the trio head to the Janus laboratory at the Statue of Liberty.

Rico betrays Griffin and replaces the DNA for the Janus clones with his own. Herman uses his hacking skills to save Dredd and Hershey from the robot. Rico orders his clones activated prematurely, but they fail to stop Dredd. Dredd pursues Rico to the top of the statue, and a final struggle sends Rico falling to his death. Central, the citys controlling supercomputer, has recorded the entire event and broadcasts the information, clearing Dredds name. The remaining Judges ask him to become the new Chief Justice, but Dredd passes the title to Hershey.

==Production==

The costumes used in the film were designed by Gianni Versace.  

Film composer   as well as on the films soundtrack album. The song "Judge Yrself" by the Manic Street Preachers was originally going to be on the soundtrack. Their guitarist Richey Edwards disappeared in early 1995, and since the song was the last written with him in the band, it never made it to the final soundtrack listing. The song was not released until 2003, when the band released Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers).

Prior to production, the producer Edward Pressman had the script rewritten by Walon Green, Rene Balcer and Michael S. Chernuchin. 

According to interview with writer Steven E. de Souza for Den Of Geek web site in December 2013, original cut of Judge Dredd was rated NC-17 and had to be re-cut and submitted to the MPAA five times in order to get an R rating. This was before Stallone and studio tried to cut the movie even further to get PG-13 rating. Example, scene where Rico kills news reporter Hammond and his wife was originally longer and it showed two of them getting hit by bullets in slow-mo. Scene where ABC Warrior robot kills Judge Griffin by ripping his arms and legs off while Griffin screams was also deleted for these reasons. This scene was not to be shown onscreen but director Danny Cannon wanted to make the movie more and more violent (just like original comic was, which he was a fan of) despite the fact that studio and Stallone wanted for movie to be PG-13 with more focus on humour.  Probably the most infamous deleted sequence is one where Dredd fights and shoots clones Judges during the ending. This scene was deleted for unknown reasons, however some promotional stills show parts of it, clones waking up and Dredd shooting one of them. There was also a Megazine article about this deleted sequence.  Some of the other parts of the movie got cut out as well by Stallone and studio. Director Danny Cannon was so disheartened over his constant creative disputes with Stallone that he swore he would never again work with another big-name actor. He also claimed that the final version was completely different from the script, due to the changes Stallone demanded. In later interviews, Stallone said he felt the film was supposed to be a comedy/action film, and demanded rewrites to make it even more comedic. The director and screenwriter, however, had intended a darker, more satirical approach, which led to many difficulties behind the scenes.

==Reception==
  
The film received negative reviews upon its release. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 18% based on reviews from 51 critics, with an average rating of 3.7/10; the sites critical consensus is "Judge Dredd wants to be both a legitimate violent action flick and a parody of one, but director Danny Cannon fails to find the necessary balance to make it work." 

 
The film was considered to be a flop in the United States as it grossed only $34.7 million in the North American domestic box office receipts. It did a better internationally with over $78.8 million around the world reaching a total of $113.5 million worldwide.

===Stallones view of the film===
Thirteen years after the release of Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone discussed his feelings about the movie in an issue of Uncut (magazine)|Uncut magazine in 2008:
  I loved that property when I read it, because it took a genre that I love, what you could term the action morality film and made it a bit more sophisticated. It had political overtones. It showed how if we dont curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film Ive done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. Theres a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasnt balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea; just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didnt live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldnt have tried to make it Hamlet; its more Hamlet and Eggs...  

===Wagners view of the film===
John Wagner, the creator of the comic character on which the film was based, said when interviewed by Empire (film magazine)|Empire in 2012: "the story had nothing to do with Judge Dredd, and Judge Dredd wasn’t really Judge Dredd." 

In an interview with Total Film he said that the film had "tried to do too much" and "told the wrong story".
