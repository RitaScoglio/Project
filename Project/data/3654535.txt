==Story==
The opening credits roll over a flying, nighttime stock footage shot of downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

The dialogue begins at a wedding reception at the table of three mobsters.  Carmine Pasquale (Mark DeCarlo) is complaining about the taste of the coffee.  We find out later that Carmine has the nickname of "The Beans" because he orders a very special type of coffee bean that he grinds himself.  When he sees a young man walk through the room, he and his team leaves the table, following the young man.

In a recent jewelry store robbery, two necklaces went missing.  Carmine and his team are questioning the young man to find out what happened to the necklaces.  Carmine tells his team to tie him up.  Carmine goes to talk to the boss, Angello Marcello, where he finds out that someone else got the promotion to captain that he was hoping to get.  When he gets back to the room, the young man has been duct taped, so the three mobsters have to carry him out to the car.  This is when the FBI manages to get the incriminating photographs.  When the mobsters make a stop to pick up the necklaces, the police close in and arrest them.
 Happy Valley, Utah.

Meanwhile, in the neighborhood in to which the Cheesemans will be moving, the bishop of the local ward has to leave the church meeting because he was paged with a family emergency.  His first counselor, Brother Jaymes, is left in charge of the meeting.  By the time that the Jaymes family arrives at home, we find out that the bishops father has died and the bishop will be in a distant community for a few weeks taking care of the funeral and deciding (with the rest of his family) on the disposition of the family farm.

What follows is culture shock, on both sides.  When the neighborhood men attempt to help them move in, George (Carmine) thinks theyre stealing their stuff so he punches one of them in the face.  The next to visit the Cheesemans is the neighborhood gossip|busybody, who is on the phone the minute she leaves their house and turns most of the neighborhood (all Mormons) against the Cheesemans (Catholics).  The next to visit is the Jaymes family, who befriends the Cheeseman family, inviting them to participate in ward activities.  Throughout the film, the Jaymes family does manage to get a few more of the neighbors to befriend the Cheeseman family.  The members of the Cheeseman family also becomes closer to each other, and begin attending the local Catholic church as a family.
 IT guy.  He has found that since Carmines disappearance, there has only been one new home address ordering the special beans that Carmine likes.  A team of two is sent to take care of Carmine.  When they show up to verify that Carmine lives at the address, Carmine spots them and takes off on foot.  There is a short car chase that ends with the FBI capturing the mobsters.  The FBI uses an insider to leak that the team was captured before Carmine found out about them, knowing that another team will be sent.  After leaving a dinner at the local ward (LDS Church)|ward, the Cheesemans get in their van and it blows up.
 bishop is stake president to become the next bishop of this ward.  About half of the ward members vote against supporting Michael Jaymes as bishop.  The stake president calls a special meeting of the ward (without the Jaymes family present) to find out why they will not support Jaymes as bishop.  George (Carmine), having found out about them not supporting Jaymes, shows up at the meeting to speak on behalf of Michael Jaymes.  Since he has revealed that he is alive, he and his family also go to visit the Jaymes family.  The stake president stops by later and tells Michael Jaymes that he will be the bishop.
