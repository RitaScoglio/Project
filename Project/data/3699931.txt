==Plot==
Undisputed heavyweight boxing champion George "Iceman" Chambers is convicted of rape and sentenced to a new prison in the desert called Sweetwater. The high-security facility is populated by hardened criminals. Unaware of the prisons ways and its unique hierarchy, the pompous and bratty Chambers tries to impress upon the inmates his status as a champion boxer.

The prison camp, within its own walls, has a riveting competition on which a betting syndicate thrives. Criminals fight in boxing matches with very lax rules, thus making it a very addictive and lucrative venture for the syndicate while their conscience is kept at bay. The most popular boxer behind bars is Sweetwaters undefeated Monroe Hutchens, who ends up in solitary confinement after Chambers picks a fight with him in the mess hall.

Sensing the brewing hatred for the heavyweight champion, an incarcerated mob boss named Ripstein senses potential in a match  between the modest Hutchens and the egomaniacal Chambers. A match is proposed by Ripstein, a lifelong boxing fan, and the warden is persuaded to look the other way.

As all the arrangements are finally organized, an eagerly awaited fight night arrives. All hell breaks loose with the haughty professional champ going all out against the unputdownable prison warrior. Chambers finally meets his match. When he is later released from prison, he regains the "undisputed" heavyweight championship of the outside world.

==Production==
The film was shot over 39 days with finance raised from a number of American and European companies.  Walter Hill said he had always wanted to make a boxing film, being a fan of the sport since he was young. "Some say Hollywood movies that are made about boxing are just metaphors for other things, I think Ive made one thats actually about boxing and not a metaphor."   accessed 25 May 2014 

Hill said the film needed to be cast with black actors to have "serious credibility." He took the treatment to Wesley Snipes who was interested in the story even before it had been turned into a script. 
"I told him it was conceivable that he could play either   role, but what will not change is the fight and who wins in the end," Hill said. 

Hill then sent the script to Ving Rhames who called back the next day saying he wanted to play the Ice Man; Snipes was happy to play the other role.
