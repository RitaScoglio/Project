Hope Floats is a 1998 American romantic drama film directed by Forest Whitaker and starring Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick, Jr., and Gena Rowlands.

Birdee (Bullock) is an unassuming housewife whose life is disrupted when her husband (Michael Pare) reveals his infidelity to her on a Ricki Lake-style talk show. She goes home to her mother (Rowlands) and the small town in which she grew up, where everyone knows of her televised marital collapse. Things only get worse as a family tragedy brings her ex-husband back for an official divorce. Meanwhile an old friend, Justin (Connick, Jr.), has entered her life, sparking a romance. While Justins intentions are clear and good, Birdee struggles with the decision to let him fully into her life.

==Plot==
Birdee Pruitt (Sandra Bullock) is a Chicago housewife who is invited onto a talk show under the pretense of getting a free makeover but instead is ambushed with the revelation that her husband Bill has been having an affair with her best friend Connie. Humiliated on national television, Birdee and her daughter Bernice (Mae Whitman) move back to Birdees hometown of Smithville, Texas, with Birdees eccentric mother Ramona (Gena Rowlands) to make a fresh start. As Birdee and Bernice leave Chicago, Birdee gives Bernice a letter from her father, telling Bernice how much he misses her. 

Birdee struggles to make a new life as a working single mother and deals with the growing attraction between herself and a former high school classmate, Justin Matisse (Harry Connick, Jr.).  She also tries to rebuild her relationship with her estranged mother, her ailing father (who suffers from Alzheimers Disease), and her daughter, who wants desperately to be with her father and blames her mother for the breakup, even trying to sabotage the romantic overtures Justin makes towards Birdee.  
 queen bee and a beauty pageant winner, which alienated many of her former classmates.  They also havent forgotten Birdees high school snobbery and rub her nose in her televised embarrassment.

Ramona tries to mend the gap between her daughter and granddaughter by telling a childhood story of her own.  She asks Bernice what shes wishing for her birthday.  Bernice secretly wishes for her father to return. 

That night, drinking a cup of tea before she could sleep, Ramona suffers a massive heart attack and dies. At the funeral, Bill arrives at the church.  Bernice believes her fathers presence is a sign her wish has come true...that her father wants them both to come home. However, it soon becomes clear to her that her parents split is permanent when Bill asks Birdee for a divorce.  Wanting to be with her father, Bernice is devastated when he tells her that even though he loves her, he has no room for her in his new life with Connie.  Crushed at the thought that her father put another woman before her, Bernice breaks down sobbing, screaming for him to come back and take her with him.  Bill turns his back on her and drives off, leaving her to be comforted by her mother. As Birdee comforts Bernice up in her room, Bernice learns the letter was actually written by Birdee, and not really by her father.

Bernice ultimately accepts Bills departure from her life as a full-time parent and begins to accept Justin as her mothers new love interest and a father figure.  Mother and daughter share a tender yet humorous moment when Bernice asks Birdee if shes going to marry Justin.  When Birdee asks her if she doesnt like Justin, Bernice says her only real concern is being known as "Bernice Matisse".
