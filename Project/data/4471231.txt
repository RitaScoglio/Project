}} 1929 Korean Japanese occupation of Korea. Originally entitled Crossing the Duman River (두만강을 건너서), the film was banned and censored by the Japanese occupying authorities after its first showing. Popular demand caused it to be re-released, though in a heavily edited form, and renamed In Search of Love. As with the vast majority of Korean films of this era, Salangeul chajaseo is a lost film.

==Plot summary== Duman River bugle he had carried with him all his life. Dong-min takes the bugle and continues playing it.
