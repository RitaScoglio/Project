==Plot summaries==
  (1955).]]
 Bengali named Apu (Apurba Kumar Roy) in the early part of the 20th century.

Pather Panchali (Bengali language|Bengali, "Song of the Little Road") 
Apus early experiences in rural Bengal as the son of a poor but high caste family are presented. Apus father Harihar, a Brahmin, has difficulty in supporting his family. After the death of Apus sister, Durga, the family moves to the holy city of Varanasi|Benares.

Aparajito (Bengali, "The Unvanquished") 
The familys finances are still precarious. After his father dies there, Apu and his mother Sarbajaya come back to a village in Bengal. Despite unrelenting poverty, Apu manages to get formal schooling and turns out to be a brilliant student. The growing Apu comes into conflict with his mother. Later, when his mother dies too, he has to learn to live alone.

Apur Sansar (Bengali, "The World of Apu") 
Attempting to become a writer, Apu accidentally finds himself pressured to marry a girl who has rejected her mentally ill bridegroom. Their blossoming marriage ends in her death in childbirth, after which the despairing Apu abandons his child, but eventually returns to accept his responsibilities.

==Production== Pather Panchali, The River Italian neorealist Indian theatrical tradition, particularly the Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa theory of classical Sanskrit drama. The complicated doctrine of rasa "centers predominantly on feeling experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator. The duality of this kind of a rasa imbrication" shows in The Apu Trilogy. 
 West Bengal government, the film was finally completed and released in 1955 to great critical and popular success, sweeping up numerous prizes and having long runs in both India and abroad. During the making of the film, Ray refused funding from sources who demanded a change in script or the supervision of the producer, and ignored advice from the government (which finally funded the film anyway) to incorporate a happy ending in having Apus family join a "development project".  Even greater help than Renoirs encouragement occurred when Ray showed a sequence to John Huston who was in India scouting locations for The Man Who Would Be King. The sequence is the remarkable vision Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside. It was the only sequence Ray had filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art that a major talent was on the horizon.
 
In India, the reaction to the film was enthusiastic, The Times of India wrote that "It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema   Pather Panchali is pure cinema".    In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of the film.  However, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the movie, François Truffaut is reported to have said, "I dont want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands." {{cite news

 Robin Wood, Aparna Sen). Ray introduced two of his favourite actors Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in this film. The film finds Apu living in a nondescript Kolkata house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna, the scenes of their life together forming "one of the cinemas classic affirmative depiction of married life",    but tragedy ensues. After Apur Sansar was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it—a rare event in Rays film making career (the other major instance involved the film Charulata, Rays personal favourite).  His success had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. Ray continued to live with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family in a rented house.

This extract from the South African author J. M. Coetzee, talks of the music in the Apu trilogy, which is based on Indian classical music. From Coetzees Youth:

{{cquote|
At the Everyman Cinema there is a season of Satyajit Ray. He watches the Apu trilogy on successive nights in a state of rapt absorption. In Apus bitter, trapped mother, his engaging, feckless father he recognizes, with a pang of guilt, his own parents. But it is the music above all that grips him, dizzyingly complex interplays between drums and stringed instruments, long arias on the flute whose scale or mode – he does not know enough about music theory to be sure which – catches at his heart, sending him into a mood of sensual melancholy that last long after the film has ended. }}
