==Release==
Between March and October 1997, Death and Rebirth grossed 1.1 billion yen. 

On July 26, 2005, Manga Entertainment released Death and Rebirth and The End of Evangelion together in the United States as a two-disc set.
 Kaji to Shinji informing Asuka of ADR director Amanda Winn-Lee, also the voice of Rei in the dub, felt the sound was not a proper "gunshot" and replaced it with a more overt effect. However, the Japanese screenplay mentions that the sound effect is not a gunshot at all, but rather the sound of a slap (the following scene implies Asuka has slapped Shinjis face) and fans have criticized this change as an example of dub actors and directors overstepping their bounds when adapting Japanese animation into English. 

===Versions===
Evangelion: Death(True) screened on January 2, 1998 on the Japanese satellite TV channel WOWOW; this version of Evangelion: Death was personally re-edited by Masayuki, removing much of the new footage from episodes 21-24.

  
Another version titled Revival of Evangelion was released on March 8, 1998 and is a unification of the movies Death(True) 2  (a further edit of Death(true), with several minor edits) and The End of Evangelion. It is considered the final form of the Evangelion movies, which had been released in several forms prior to Revival. The two were released on the ninth and tenth discs of the Renewal of Evangelion box set with the labels of Revival of Evangelion and Evangelion – The Feature Film.
