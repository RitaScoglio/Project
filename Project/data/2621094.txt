 1999 Cinema Hong Kong comedy film directed by Lee Lik-Chi and Stephen Chow.  Unlike Stephen Chows typical mo lei tau films, King of Comedy verges on comedy drama, describing the trials and tribulation that an aspiring actor experiences on his way to stardom. Some commentators  say the story is based on Stephen Chows early career, as he started off as a temporary actor, before becoming a successful and popular comedy actor over the course of a decade. The film does retain some of bizarre visual gags Chow is known for, such as Chows character bleeding from the nose and eyes during a singing number. Jackie Chan plays a cameo role during the film.
