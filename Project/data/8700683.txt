The story follows Mulder and Scully who have been out of the FBI for several years, with Mulder living in isolation as a fugitive from the organization and Scully having become a doctor at a Catholic-run hospital, where she has formed a friendly relationship with a seriously ill patient.

==Plot== FBI agent, the series finale. Drummy states that the FBI will call off its manhunt for Mulder if he helps investigate the disappearances of several women in Virginia, the latest of whom is a young FBI agent named Monica Bannan (Xantha Radley). Scully agrees and convinces a reluctant Mulder to help.

The duo is taken to Washington, D.C., where Agent Dakota Whitney (Peet) requests Mulders expertise with the paranormal as they have been led to a clue; a severed human arm by Father Joseph Fitzpatrick Crissman (Connolly). He is a former priest defrocked for the child molestation of thirty-seven altar boys, and claims God is sending him visions of the crimes. A second woman, driving home after swimming in a natatorium, is run off the road by a truck driven by  Janke Dacyshyn (Rennie), who then abducts her. Father Joe is again recruited for help with the second abducted woman. After a grueling nighttime search in a snow-covered field, he leads the FBI to what turns out to be a frozen burial ground of people and body parts. Analysis of the remains, along with tracking down the recent movements from the second abducted womans car crash, eventually leads them to Dacyshyn, an organ transporter in Richmond, Virginia, and his husband, Franz Tomczeszyn (Woodcock) who was among the youths Father Joe sexually abused.

Scully, unable to reach Mulder on his cell phone, contacts her old FBI superior, Director Walter Skinner (Pileggi), for help. They triangulate the phones location and find Scullys wrecked car, eventually making their way through the snow to find the compound as Mulder is about to be axed by Dacyshyn. Scully attacks him in an ensuing confrontation, incapacitating him, while Skinner breaks up the medical procedure before the young woman is beheaded.

==Production==

===Development=== Rob Bowman, who had directed episodes of The X-Files in the past as well as the 1998 film, expressed an interest in filming the sequel in July 2002. 

In April 2004, Duchovny said he was waiting for the films production to begin, explaining that Carter had signed off on the premise. Duchovny said of the delay, "So now its just a matter of making sure everybody can get together at the same time and do it."  The following November, Carter revealed that the project was in the negotiation stage, explaining, "Because its a sequel, there are peculiar and specific kinds of negotiations that are holding us up."  Duchovny spoke of the premise for the yet-produced film in 2005, "Mulder and Scully investigate one particular case that has nothing to do with alien life. It has to do with supernatural stuff."  He also explained, "I think were going back to the monster of the week type feel, where if youre not an avid fan and dont understand the mythology, you can still come to it and get the movie."  Duchovny and Carter planned to begin production in the winter of 2005 to be released in the summer of 2006.  The following April, Duchovny admitted to a lack of a script, adding that Carter would have it ready by early next year. 

In May 2006, Spotnitz blamed the continued delay on legal matters between Carter and 20th Century Fox. The screenwriter anticipated, "Once the legal issues are over with, we will go on with it. Im hoping it will get resolved soon." By April 2007, Spotnitz confirmed that a script was finally in development.   The following October, the studio officially announced the production of the sequel film, whose premise would be kept under wraps.   

===Filming===
The film was shot in Vancouver and Pemberton, British Columbia|Pemberton, in British Columbia, Canada. According to Spotnitz, the script was written specifically for these locations.    Filming began in December 2007 in Vancouver under the direction of Carter,    and shooting finished on March 11, 2008.     In a teaser trailer shown at Wondercon on February 23, 2008, the date "July 25, 2008" appeared at the end, and was the only text in the trailer. On March 27, 2008, the horror film site, Bloody Disgusting, reported a bootleg video of the official trailer uploaded by a user on YouTube. {{cite web | last=Miska| first=Brad| url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/11752 | title=Bootleg X-Files 2 Trailer Online Now!!

  Alvin "Xzibit" Joiner) and Father Joe (Billy Connolly) drove to the missing agents home, the same scene also includes footage of the actors that was filmed on a stage, using a rear projection to show the exterior from inside the car. The latter method was used for all the shots in which any of the travelers appear. 

Several of the other locations were filmed in and around Pemberton Valley. Key scenes were also filmed in Riverlands.   The interior of Scullys home was a set in Burnaby, outside of Vancouver. The set was an old roller rink or at least sounded like one, as it was very noisy. During filming, Carter placed a carrot juice bottle on the table of the set, having just finished the drink, as he thought it would be "a nice sort of Mulder touch." Some of the artwork in Mulders office came from a friend of Carters who had a gallery in Vancouver and was named Monica Reyes, a name that had previously been used in her honor for a character who features in a recurring role in the series eighth season and appears as a main character in every episode of the series ninth season. One of the pictures on the wall of Mulders office was by Douglas Coupland, who was featured in the real Monica Reyes gallery and had written a book Carter liked which was called Hey Nostradamus!, so Carter stuck a Post-It on which he wrote the books title onto the picture. 

The exterior of the dorms for habitual sex offenders where Father Joe lives, was actually an apartment complex in Vancouver that was slated for demolition while the production crew were filming there. Snow that can be seen outside the dorms, was actually fake snow that was imported by the crew and fabricated by the films Special Effects Department. Bill Roe and Mark Freeborn worked together to create a creepy green glow on the location using green lights. The production crew also created their own factory smoke for chimneys in the background, as Carter came to the opinion that the smoking chimneys made the location look like London. The interior of Joes apartment was another set and was exactly like the real apartment except that it was slightly bigger. A trans-light was incorporated into the set to resemble daylight visible through a window of the apartment. The set also had a porch that was used for some shots in the scene where Mulder and Scully were outside the apartment.  Riverview Hospitals Unit 8 building.

===Title===
The code name Done One was used as the films working title during filming, with location signs labeled as "Done One Productions."  The name meant the producers had already done one film. "The Crying Box Productions" was listed as the production company, instead of Carters usual "Ten Thirteen Productions."  The Hollywood Reporter posted a series of information sheets regarding upcoming studio films, and the 20th Century Fox fact sheet referred to the film as The X-Files: Done One. 

On April 16, 2008, the official title of the film was announced: The X-Files: I Want to Believe. Carter referred to the title as a "natural title", saying that it pertained to "a story that involves the difficulties in mediating faith and science. I Want to Believe. It really does suggest Scullys struggle with her faith." Carter also said that he and Spotnitz settled upon the title as soon as they started writing the screenplay. This title is a popular phrase among X-Files fans. It is featured on the UFO poster above Mulders desk. 

===Music===

Carter and his production crew wanted as much secrecy for the film as possible, forcing Snow to sign a contract when receiving the script. After reading the script three times, Snow started on the "visuals" for the story. Snow wrote a couple of demos at the start; of which Carter and Frank Spotnitz were not pleased about, but eventually worked when Snow re-recorded them.

Snow recorded the score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony in May 2008 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City, California.    No music was written out during Snows recording session with the symphony orchestra. When making the music, Snow used such instruments as the "battery of percussion" taiko drums and whistles with live singers among other things. It took four days to record with the orchestra. He used no trumpets and no high woodwinds when recording, but used up to eight french horns, five trombones, two pianos, one harp, thirty-two violins, sixteen violas, twelve cellos and eight Bass guitar|basses.

"The X-Files: I Want to Believe" arrives billed as a "stand-alone" film that requires no familiarity with the famous television series. So it is, leaving us to piece together the plot on our own.

 s performance, believes, "It seems unlikely that this franchise will reach The X-Files X".    Jason Anderson of Canadas CBC News called the film "muddled" with a "hurried and half-baked" climax, and said, "Beyond the pleasure of seeing Duchovny and Anderson back in action and back on form," the film "offers little to either the longtime fans or newcomers".  Jan Stuart from The Los Angeles Times commented, "The X-Files was a load of malarkey. But it was thoughtful malarkey and compulsively watchable. One could say the same about the first two-thirds of "The X-Files: I Want to Believe" before it spins out of control and into a delirious plane of awfulness." 
 The Dark Chris Carter to return to the more comedic and "post-modern" elements of the series upon the next revisit.  Stephanie Zackarek was mostly positive towards the film, saying; "I Want to Believe comes off like a solid if not great episode from one of the shows early seasons, a reasonably suspenseful story made by a director with a sturdy sense of how to tell a story."  Mick LaSalle was also positive towards the film, saying that you didnt need to know anything about the previous settings and calling it a "compelling suspense thriller with some tense moments."  TV Guide reviewer Maitland McDonagh gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying that the film was not "sufficiently gripping to transform a middling thriller into something truly provocative or haunting." About the theme and story she said, "such weighty concerns arent the stuff of most mainstream genre movies." 

===Accolades===
 
While receiving no award nominations from accredited organizations, the film was included on a ballot sent to Golden Raspberry Award voters, along with twelve other films to be considered under the category "Worst Prequel, Sequel, Remake or Rip-Off." It failed to make the final list of nominees. 

==Sequel==
In several interviews he gave around the time the film came out,  .   Fox Chairman Tom Rothman, responding to an interview question regarding the possibility of a third X-Files movie, said in October 2008, "Its really up to Chris  , David   and Gillian  ".  There have been no subsequent statements from Rothman or other studio executives regarding a third film, even though Carter, Spotnitz and both stars have all since repeatedly said they would like to make one. 

During an interview at the Sarajevo Film Festival in August 2009, Gillian Anderson was asked about a third film and responded, "They talked about maybe doing it in 2012. I think there were discussions about that. I dont know whether thats going to happen or not, but there isnt any reason not to do it."  Frank Spotnitz responded to his blog readers requests for clarification regarding Andersons comments by denying that any deal was in place, saying, "Im afraid I have no news to report other than our continuing desire to make a third film if theres an audience for it."  In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said he wants to do a 2012 X-Files movie, but still doesnt know if hell get the chance.   Carter in December 2009 said he could not "ensure" another movie would be made, but thought the international box office for the 2008 film made it at least a theoretical possibility.  In an interview published in August 2012, Spotnitz said he was talking up the idea of an X-Files movie every chance he got, but that there was still nothing happening on that front, and that time was running very short for a third movie concluding the original X-Files franchise to be made at all.  He blamed the poor performance of the 2008 film on the fact that it wasnt about aliens. 

Speaking at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, Chris Carter, when asked about a third film, was extremely non-committal, indicating there was still no forward movement, and saying, "We can get to it later." 

On August 2013, Chris Carter said, in an interview with Empire (magazine)|Empire, that "Its really up to 20th Century Fox, whether they have the will to do it. I think all of us are interested in putting the band back together", adding that a third installment would be a return to the mythology and that the colonisation date of the television series wouldnt be ignored. 

In March 2015, it was confirmed that there would be a six episode miniseries on FOX, featuring Duchovny, Anderson, and some other members of the original cast, which would have both standalone and mythology elements.   There was no mention of any further theatrical films, and the idea of a film franchise seemed to have been completely abandoned.
