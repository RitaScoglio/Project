==Plot==
Dr. Stanislaus Pyckle, (a play of the actors name, Stan Laurel), successfully separates the good and evil of mans nature with the use of a powerful drug -- "Dr. Pyckles 58th Variety", a spoof of "Heinz Foods|Heinzs 57". Transforming into the personality of Mr. Pride (again Laurel), he terrorizes the town with unspeakable acts including stealing a boyâ€™s ice cream, cheating at marbles, and popping a bag behind a lady pedestrian. The towns people track him down where Mr. Pride locks himself in the laboratory and transforms back at Dr. Pyckle. The doctor assures the townspeople that he hasnt seen the "fiend" they were after. While he talks, the drug used for the transformation spills in the plate of food of the doctors dog. Dr. Pyckle confronts the fiendish dog when he locks the door and the townspeople leave. But once again, Mr. Pride emerges and brings havoc to the town, and again is chased down by the townspeople. He enters the lab and transforms back into Pyckle, and again assures the townspeople he hasnt seen the fiend. His assistant (Julie Leonard) begs the doctor to open and comfort him, but he transforms back into Mr. Pride. He opens the door to the assistant and locks it again. She screams seeing Pride and the townspeople hurry back, before the assistant can knock Pride down.
 spoof on the make-up designed for John Barrymore as Mr. Hyde. Also spoofed are the sudden and strange movements Barrymores Jekyll makes during the transformation, as well as Hydes confrontation with Millicent, Jekylls fiancee, when Hyde lets her inside the lab. Other scenes show obvious parodies of other Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde films (e.g. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920/II film)
and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1912 film)).
