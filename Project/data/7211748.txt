==Synopsis==
 dumbwaiter down, but the cable snaps and plunges to the bottom.  The crash leaves her unhurt, but clad only in her lingerie (Bimbo obligingly returns her dress).  The two discover a team of ghosts playing a game of baseball, with a cartoon bomb as the ball.  Bimbo and Betty head to the surface in the elevator, unwittingly carrying the bomb with them.  They send it back down, and the resultant explosion fills all the railroad cars with coal.  The ghosts are also blown into the air, and land in graves opened by a laughing Bimbo.
