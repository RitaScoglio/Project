Alls Fair at the Fair is a seven minute cartoon released in 1938. A Color Classic produced by Max Fleischer, it was distributed by Paramount Pictures|Paramount.

==Plot==
The Film Daily called the short a "novelty cartoon" and gave the following review:

 
"A couple of sticks visit the fair grounds where the Worlds Fair is being held, and find themselves participating in a series of adventures with the ultra-modern mechanism operated by robots. Finally, they reach the dance pavilion, and the wife and husband each are taken in hand by robots and whirled around the floor. Other mechanical gags give them a marvelous meal, beauty and barber treatments, and clinical attention to restore their youth. Very clever and novel. A Max Fleischer cartoon in Technicolor."
