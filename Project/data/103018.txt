==Plot== Los Angeles Rams, is looking forward to leading his team to the Super Bowl. While riding his bicycle through the Mulholland Drive tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles, he collides with a truck. An over-anxious guardian angel (Buck Henry) on his first assignment plucks Joe out of his body early, in the mistaken belief that his death is imminent, and Pendleton arrives in the afterlife.

Once there, he refuses to believe that his time was up and, upon investigation, the mysterious Mr. Jordan ( ) and her lover, Farnsworths personal secretary, Tony Abbott (Charles Grodin).

Julia and Tony are naturally confused when Leo reappears, alive and well. Leo buys the Los Angeles Rams to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince, and then secure the aid of, long-time friend and trainer Max Corkle (Jack Warden) to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with an environmental activist, Betty Logan (Julie Christie), who disapproves of Farnsworths policies and actions.

As the films plotline heads toward the Super Bowl, the characters all face a crisis. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott shoots Farnsworth dead. The Rams are forced to start another quarterback, Thomas Jarrett, in the climactic football game. After a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is himself killed. With Mr. Jordans help, Joe then occupies his final body, that of Jarrett. Joe is shown snapping to life in Jarretts body, then leading the Rams to victory.

During the teams post-game victory celebration, Mr. Jordan removes Joes memory of his past life and departs.  Joe becomes Thomas Jarrett and the cosmic balance is restored; the winning quarterback, Jarrett, is shown meeting Betty after the celebrations have ended and as the film ends it is strongly implied that they are falling in love as a result of a mutual sense of déjà vu.

Future game-show host Peter Tomarken appears as a reporter in the film.

==Production==
Beatty initially wanted Muhammad Ali to play the central character, but because of Alis continued commitment to boxing, Beatty changed the character from a boxer to an American football player and played it himself.  The type of instrument he played was also changed; in Here Comes Mr. Jordan, Pendelton essays "The Last Rose of Summer" on the alto saxophone, while in the 1978 film he plays Ciribiribin on a soprano sax. The training music is Handels sonata no 12 op 1, in F major, HWV 370 allegro 2. Beatty also wanted legendary actor and his idol, Cary Grant to play the role of Mr. Jordan. Grant passed on the role, Beatty begged Grant to play the role and Beatty even pleaded to Grants ex-wife, Dyan Cannon to also beg him to play the role. Ultimately, Mr. Jordan was played by James Mason.
