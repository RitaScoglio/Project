 Tony Cox); and Felisha (Angela Means), Debbies sister and Deebos girlfriend, who irritates everyone in the neighborhood with her constant begging.

Smokey, who has been smoking rather than selling his consignment of marijuana, has a confrontation with Big Worm. In an attempt to explain his money shortage, Smokey incriminates Craig. Big Worm threatens to kill them both if they do not give him two hundred dollars by ten pm.

Craig angrily confronts Smokey about his lack of initiative in selling the marijuana before resolving to help Smokey. Craig unsuccessfully attempts to borrow money from his mother (Anna Maria Horsford), his sister, Dana (Regina King), and his insanely jealous girlfriend, Joi (Paula Jai Parker).  
 John Witherspoon), eventually learns of Craigs plight, as well as the fact that Craig is carrying a gun. Willie scolds him, explaining that Craig should use his fists, instead of guns, to resolve his problems.

Later on, while Craig and Smokey discuss their dilemma, theyre interrupted by the arrival of Rita (  as she originally claimed, Rita is obese and practically bald.

Smokey heads to Debbies house to complain and notices Reds bike on the lawn. He sneaks in and finds Deebo asleep with Felisha. Smokey tries to reclaim the money that he and Deebo stole from Stanley, but is interrupted by Ezail. Both escape without the money before Deebo wakes up. Smokey returns to Craigs house to tell him, and Craig agrees to go back with Smokey to try again, but at that moment, Deebo rides past.

The two notice a black van driving slowly and hide, suspecting a possible drive-by shooting. Scared, they run to Craigs room, then agree to venture out. Once outside, they notice the van parked in the street with its headlights off. The two flee as men in the van start shooting at them.

The neighbors emerge from their homes upon hearing the gunshots. Debbie then confronts Deebo for assaulting Felicia after Deebo falsely accuses Felicia of Smokeys attempted theft. Deebo eventually assaults Debbie, as Craig and Smokey arrive. 

Angered that Deebo has struck a woman, Craig stands up to him, threatening him with his gun. Deebo scoffs at the threat and Willie encourages Craig to lower the weapon and fight with his hands. Craig and Deebo fight. Craig, after nearly losing, emerges victorious by using various objects (including a brick) as weapons. 

As Debbie tends to Craig, Smokey steals the money from an unconscious Deebo and ditches the scene. Red punches Deebo again to ensure he doesnt wake up and retrieves his chain and bicycle while Ezail steals Deebos shoes. Craig and Debbie agree to meet up the following day (hinting at a potential romance), and Craig breaks up with Joi over the phone.

Later, Smokey settles with Big Worm, thus ending the feud. He announces that he is giving up drug dealing and going to Drug rehabilitation|rehab.
