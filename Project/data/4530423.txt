}} 1942 Mexico|Mexican film.

==Plot== Queen Anne.

==Production==
Posa films hired the European designer Manolo Fontanals to create a replica of the court of King Louis XIII and imported costumes from Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood.

==Critical reception==
The use of foreign storylines was an attempt to appeal to audiences outside of Mexico and the rest of Latin America, but the largely improvised humor depended not on parodying the work in question, but on physical humor and improvisations based on speech patterns local to Mexico. Critic Emilio García Riera opined, "One could frankly say that the comic had not read The Three Musketeers, and that, without a clear idea of what he should be parodying, resorted to   of sure effect."
 La Nación thought Los tres mosqueteros was Morenos finest work, elevating the impoverished pelado to the rank of nobility through his service to the royal family.

The film was screened at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival, where it disappointed critics. The French people themselves were not as hostile, seeing in Moreno a Mexican version of their own Fernandel.

Luis Garrido, a contemporary journalist, saw Morenos failure to earn the approval of the French film elite as the result of the diversion of his energies into union struggles and politics.
