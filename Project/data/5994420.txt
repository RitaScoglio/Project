==Plot synopsis==
Christopher Powell is in Malaya with his fiancée and her father, capturing wild animals. While out hunting, he is attacked by a tiger, and his native guides run away, leaving him for dead. But the tiger is the pet of Ulah, a beautiful young woman who grew up by herself in the jungle. She rescues Chris and takes him back to her cave, where she nurses him to health and falls in love with him. When he eventually 
returns to camp, she follows. The fiancée is jealous, and the natives do not like Ulah or her pet tiger either, all of which leads to a lot of trouble.

==Reception==
The Jungle Princess was a major hit and launched Lamours career as one of the leading stars of the era, often cast in similar  sarong-clad jungle adventure romances, which led to her playing leading lady to Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in the Road to... musical comedy movie series beginning four years later.

The Indonesian film Terang Boelan (1937) was partially inspired by The Jungle Princess. {{cite book
