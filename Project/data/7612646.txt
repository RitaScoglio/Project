==Synopsis==

One man takes on a massive crime ring in First Action Hero. Set in Miami, this fast-paced film features a stressed-out but savvy cop who tries to bust up a gang of millionaire mobsters (including a very young Keanu Reeves!) who deal in drugs, violence, and prostitution. 

An unconventional, off-the-rails cop - the First Action Hero of the title - is transferred back to his old precinct, Miami, to prevent a gang war. He is forced to juggle his cop duties with the pressures of dealing with his troubled family life and a strait-laced DA.
