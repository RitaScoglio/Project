 song of the same name by The Beatles. It was produced and co-written by Bob Gale.

The film is about "Beatlemania" and is a fictionalized account of the day of the Beatles first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show (February 9, 1964). It was released in 1978 by Universal Studios.
 directorial debut of Robert Zemeckis and also the first film that Steven Spielberg executive produced. Even though modestly budgeted, in order to convince Universal to bankroll it, Spielberg had to promise studio executives that, if Zemeckis was seen to be doing a markedly poor job, he would step in and direct the film himself. 

Despite positive previews and critical response (The New York Times wrote that "the whole film sparkles with a boisterous lunacy" and called its plot "positively dazzling"),  the film was not a financial success and was considered a flop, unable to recoup its rather modest $2.8 million budget.  Zemeckis later said, "One of the great memories in my life is going to the preview.  I didnt know what to expect   the audience just went wild.  They were laughing and cheering.  It was just great.  Then we learned a really sad lesson....just because a movie worked with a preview audience didnt mean anyone wanted to go see it." 
 Nancy Allen and Eddie Deezen&mdash;appeared in the Spielberg-directed comedy film 1941 (film)|1941, which was also written by Gale and Zemeckis. Susan Kendall Newman, who played Janis Goldman, is Paul Newmans daughter.

== Plot==


Ed Sullivan prepares the ushers for the Beatles performance on his show. In Maplewood, New Jersey, Rosie and Pam visit the record shop. Janet, the owner’s daughter hates the Beatles. Grace wants to rent a limo, so they can pull up to the Beatles hotel, and get exclusive photos of the band. The girls recruit shy Larry DuBois, the local undertaker’s son as he has access to limos. They leave for New York City and on the way pick up Tony a brash, streetwise guy.  After driving all night they arrive in New York early on the morning of February 9, 1964. When they pull up at the hotel Grace, Rosie and Pam sneak in, while Larry pulls the limo with Tony and Janet in it to the side of the building. Once inside Grace and Rosie sneak into a service elevator, while Pam is left in the basement in a storage closet. Pam(who was they only one not really interested in seeing the Beatles, as she’s engaged), sees them leave the hotel as they go to rehearse. Meanwhile Grace gets off on the 11th floor. Rosie rides up to the 12th, where the Beatles’ room is located. She is caught, escapes and meets Richard Klein, a fellow Beatles fan who is hiding out in a room in the hotel. Pam hides in a food cart and is taken to the Beatle’s room, where she handles all their stuff and hides under John’s bed. Grace is caught too, so she goes to the CBS studio, where a guard tells her that for 50 dollars he will let her in backstage while the show is on. Richard and Rosie are tossed from the hotel. Janet meets a kid whose dad will give him three tickets to the Ed Sullivan Show if he will get his Beatles style hair cut into a crew cut. She recruits Tony to steal the dad’s wallet and get the tickets. Larry asks Grace to the Valentine’s Day dance at school, but she brushes him off. Grace decides to take the place of a prostitute who has an encounter at the hotel to get the 50 dollars she needs. Rosie knows the question on the radio call in to win tickets, so she uses the room key she still has, goes to the room, calls in and wins two tickets.  Richard then strands them in the elevator. Pam is caught, but interviewed by the press. Her fiancé arrives to get her, but she uses the ticket she was given by the Beatles roadie Neil Aspinall to see the show. Once in the john’s room, Grace can’t go through with it and hides, but takes photos of the john and the hooker and blackmails him into giving her 50 dollars. He attacks her, but Larry saves her. Tony lifts the dad’s wallet. It’s empty, but they get the tickets anyway. Richard and Rosie escape from the elevator and get to the show.  Tony’s effort to sabotage the show fails. Larry parks the limo beside CBS in an alley and is about to be arrested for improper parking and driving without a license, but Grace uses the 50 dollars to bribe the cop in to letting him go, but now she can’t get backstage and get her photos. Grace accepts Larry’s invitation to the dance. On leaving the show the Beatles take a wrong turn and end up in Larry’s limo. They drive away, pursued by a mob of screaming fans, while Grace snaps away.

The song "She Loves You" was featured twice toward the end of the film. The first time was during the groups appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964. For this sequence, stand-in Beatle lookalikes, dressed in identical attire and holding musical instruments in a similar manner, were seen mimicking the groups performance of the song from that show while being shown on the stage floor, albeit from a distance so as not to see their identities. The actual footage of The Beatles was revealed from the camera operators point of view. These two elements were combined with reactions from the studio audience to recreate a historic moment in time. The second use of "She Loves You" came during the end credits.

Other songs by the Beatles, ones published years after their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, are referenced as in-jokes throughout the film. They are: Helter Skelter", mentioned by an aristocratic woman who sojourns at the Beatles hotel ("Things are all helter skelter!");
# "Get Back", mentioned by a cop trying to calm a riot against his arrest of a very young Beatles fan ("Get back girls, get back!");
# "One After 909", "909" being the number of the hotel room of a man who is searching for a hooker in New York; fetishistic behaviours towards objects and musical instruments belonging to the group. "Polythene Pam" was inspired by an evening that John spent with poet Royston Ellis and his girlfriend, Stephanie. The three wore polythene (a common British contraction of the word and the IUPAC version of the word polyethylene) bags and slept in the same bed out of curiosity about kinky sex.
# "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)", mentioned by a member of the Beatles staff named Neil (probably a reference to the Beatles road manager and personal assistant Neil Aspinall) while speaking to a cop after Pam has been discovered lying under John Lennons bed  ("Is that the bird that was under Lennons bed?", a reference to a widespread interpretation that sees in "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" a confession of adultery).
# " ) concerning how to handle the situation with the press.
