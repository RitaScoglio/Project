==Plot==
 
On November 5, 1969, three high school footballers tried to drug and kidnap their prom night dates.  Their plan works with two of the girls but the third, Mary Banner (Lillith Fields), tries to escape.  The football captain chases her into a storage room and punches her, knocking her out. Unable to revive her nor able to hear her heartbeat, he believes Mary to be dead. Panicking, he locks her body in an old trunk.
 Bloody Mary and the next morning all three are gone.  After having been missing for one day, they reappear, waking up in an old deserted mill, with no knowledge of how they got there.  While most suspect a hoax on the girls part, Samantha and David suspects that it is a prank by football players.

While Samantha is haunted by visions of a dead girl bleeding from her head, several pupils die under mysterious circumstances resembling urban legends; for example, football player Roger (Brandon Sacks) burns in a sunbed, Heather (Audra Lea Keener), girlfriend to football captain Buck (Michael Gregory Coe), has spiders erupting from a swelling on her cheek, driving her to cut her face with a mirror, and football player, Tom (Nate Herd), is electrocuted while urinating on an old electrical fence, his ring finger being bitten or cut off.  Buck blames these deaths on the Owens siblings.  Before her death, Heather made up with Samantha and tried to tell her that this happened before.  In her homework, Samantha finds notes sent to Heather about the disappearance of Mary Banner and the homecoming kidnappings of 1969, as well as notes referencing the events of the previous films.  Browsing the school papers archives, they find out that Mary was never found, that another victim committed suicide years later and that the third, Grace Taylor (Tina Lifford), still lives in town.
 headstone earlier.  Her stepfather, who overheard her, tells her to reveal any solid evidence she has.

Meanwhile, an upset Buck tries to relax by drinking and watching movie in a motel.  Falling asleep, he wakes up from hearing a dripping sound and discovers the corpse of his dog.  He is attacked by Mary, who crawls out from under his bed and kills him with his broken bottle.  Different rumours about his death are spread immediately.

Both siblings are trying to find clues about the fifth remaining perpetrator; Samantha by browsing through old photographs, David by visiting Grace again.  Grace still refuses to reveal the names but directs him to the school archives.  Going through the archives, he finds out the identity of the fifth person and rushes home, but finds Sam gone and is suffocated by a hooded man.  Samantha meanwhile has visions of Mary again, revealing that the girl was not dead when she was locked in the trunk. and that she later awoke, realizing she was buried alive. The visions also reveal to Sam the whereabouts of the trunk.Sam visits Grace, who tells her to find and bury Marys corpse and reluctantly agrees to drive Samantha to the school.  While Grace is waiting in the van, Samantha finds the storage room and the trunk with Marys corpse in it.  The hooded man also appears and enters the storage room but Samantha locks him inside while carrying Marys remains outside to the van.

Finding Grace unconscious, Samantha drives the van to the cemetery, where she begins to dig a grave for Mary under her headstone.  Her stepfather, whom Samantha had phoned, also appears and helps her digging but suddenly hits her with the shovel. Suddenly Grace intervenes and tries to fight off Mr. Owens (giving Sam a chance to run) but he eventually knocks Grace out with the shovel. Pursuing his stepdaughter through the graveyard, Mr. Owens (Ed Marinaro) reveals that he was the one that locked Mary in the trunk and that he also killed his stepson (Sams brother), David.  He finally captured her and is about to decapitate her when Mary, in her living form, appears.  Smiling towards Samantha, she kisses him, then reverts to her ghastly form and drags him with her into the grave.

When Samantha wakes up, the grave is surrounded by police and medical personnel retrieving her stepfathers corpse. Her and Grace are bandaged and treated for their wounds, and sitting together, console one another.
