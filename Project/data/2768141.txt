==Plot==
The events of the original movie take place entirely in Norway; in the English-language version of the movie, the story begins in Britain, and ends up in Norway with the traveling circus.

At night, an animal testing laboratory in grimy downtown Oslo is broken into by the "urban guerrillas", a group of bumbling, vegan animal rights activists. They first release some rabbits, which refuse to leave. They then set the rats free, then cats, which to the horror of the activists, eat the rats. They then release a small yapping dog which in turn, again to their horror, kills the cats. They bury the dead animals, vowing to at some point take revenge on "animal oppressing" society. One of them, Sonia, a highly-strung, anxiety-stricken woman, keeps the dog and names the dog "Karma".
 stoners and speed to incite the animal to go crazy and perform in the ring for the spectators. At night, he gives Jimmy heroin to sedate him. Soon the elephant is hooked on the drugs, a Drug addiction|junkie.

Roy admits to the others that he has stolen over a million pounds worth of heroin which he stole from a tanker belonging to the Russian Mafia, and that he decided on the circus to escape them. The four lads hatch a plan to smuggle the heroin out of Norway by putting all the heroin inside the elephant. Roy makes an incision in Jimmys buttocks, places the bags of drugs inside, and then sews it back up. He has a plan to set up his own circus with the money potentially made from the heroin, the "Roy Arnie Circus", and believes Jimmy to be the key to his dream. However on the night the lads plan to steal the elephant, Jimmy escapes when he is accidentally given speed instead of heroin, and he bolts out of a door left open by the animal rights activists. Jimmys drug-induced escape causes widespread chaos. Flea comically steals a van with no windshield in the ensuing chase of Jimmy, which leads them up into the frozen moorland.
 bikers who Laplander motorcycle Scottish big game hunters who want to shoot something bigger than a moose or deer for a change. So begins a mad cap cross country road trip to find Jimmy, with different groups with different motives. The four stoners crash a log cabin which is occupied by an elderly American couple, but the three Lappish Mafia bikers find them there, kill the couple and torture the four stoners for information on the whereabouts of Jimmy the elephant.

Jimmy nearly dies on the moors as he begins to go through cold turkey, although a seemingly intelligent and benevolent moose with golden antlers befriends the elephant and attempts to nurse him back to health by nudging him towards water and bringing him grass to eat. The moose pushes Jimmy into a rocky overhang, protecting the elephant from the elements. The moose forces Jimmy to stand on occasion by pushing him up and holding him up with his antlers, bringing back the strength in Jimmys legs. Over the course of a few painful days, with the mooses help, Jimmy makes a full recovery from the drugs, and again becomes one with nature away from the ugly trappings of man.

When the groups converge on Jimmys location, chaos ensues which results in most of the people involved getting killed in various ways, mostly violent and bloody. As the elephant and the moose escape into the sunset, the elephant accidentally steps on Sonia the activists dog, Karma, splatting it. Sonia momentarily loses her temper and picks up one of the hunters rifles and shoots Jimmy in the behind, unwittingly bursting the bags of heroin inside and causing Jimmy to die quickly of massive drug overdose. This causes Sonia to recoil in horror in what she has done, and she flees amidst nervous breakdown in the knowledge she has harmed an animal. The moose causes a landslide which buries Jimmys body, and after the moose sits poignantly by the mound of rocks which now entomb the elephant, the moose gallops off into the sunset alone.

The only other survivors of the massacre, the four stoners, do not witness these events, and back at their apartment assault Roy for leading them to the situation in the first place, because of his mad circus dreams, and "for Jimmy", "our mate." Finally, Roy, full of remorse over his actions in the past, wanders out onto the moors alone to look for the elephant, unaware that Jimmy is already dead and entombed under rocks and out of sight. Roy disappears into a terrible blizzard calling out "Jimmy" in vain.

==Production==
Free Jimmy is the first computer animated feature film made in Norway, and the film took nine years to make. Several Norwegian companies were involved in the production and distribution,  although a significant part of the film was produced in London at Slave Studios, the CGI company owned by animation producer Andy Frain. However, the main company involved in the production was Storm Studio, a Norwegian company.
 Max Manus was produced two years later on a bigger budget.

The lighting and rendering of the movie has been finalized in a Canadian company located in Montreal (Modelink). The entire job took nearly two years to finish and spanned 2004, 2005 and 2006.

The film is dedicated to Joachim Nielsen (1964–2000),  the directors brother and a rock musician famous in his native Norway, who had died of a drug overdose after many years of being clean. The director intended the film as an allegory of his brothers life, with the elephant representing his brother, the golden-antlered moose symbolizing hope, determination, compassion and inner strength, and the other characters in the story representing outside factors such as prejudice, selfishness, addiction, dependence, manipulation, coercion, peer pressure, weakness and temptation.

==Box office==
In its Norway the film was released in cinemas in 2006, where it was a box office hit making over 200 million Norwegian kroner in profit. However when the English-language version was released to the wider world in 2008, it was a direct-to-video release.

==Awards== Amanda in the category "Best Film" in 2006.
* Awarded "Le Cristal du long métrage" at the French Annecy International Animated Film Festival 2007. 

==Critical reception==
The original version of the film was critically well received in its native Norway, and remains something of a cult hit in the country, although this may be tied to the directors cult status in Norway, where he is renowned for his work in comic books. The film successfully portrayed modern Norwegian ironic humor. The film was noted for its animation, and won numerous international awards for it.

However, the later English-language version has received mixed reviews, mostly negative. These include a scathing review by Xan Brooks of The Guardian who described it as "joyless" and those who watch it to be "dumb animals themselves".  Many Norwegian fans noted that depth of story was missing in the new version, and that the overall message of the film and the original ironic humor had been lost in translation and the target audience had become unclear. Free Jimmy currently has a "rotten" rating of only 10% on aggregate ratings site Rotten Tomatoes.  Free Jimmy currently has 5.9 out of 10 in user ratings on the Internet Movie Database  and a three star rating out of five on MSN Movies. 

Not all English-language reviews were negative. Derek Adams of  -Pixar norm."
