Lamerica is a 1994 drama film directed by Gianni Amelio.  It entered the competition at the 51st Venice International Film Festival, in which Amelio won the Golden Osella for Best Director. 

==Plot==
 Italian racketeers fall of communism to set up a fictive firm and pocket the grants.

They need a stooge and choose Spiro Tozaj/Michele Tallarico (Carmelo Di Mazzarelli), an old man in a prison, who turns out to be an Italian veteran from World War II. Easily confused and utterly impoverished, this elderly former political prisoner seems the perfect choice, until he unexpectedly disappears.

Gino is assigned to find him, setting out on a journey that leads him to discover Spiros tragic personal history and become intimately acquainted with the full extent of Albanian poverty. Ginos car tires are stolen, while the fancy shoes he gave Spiro are also stolen by children.

Gino and Spiro follow a group of Albanians who are headed for Italy in search for a better life, first by truck and later by ship. The Albanian exodus parallels that of Italians for the United States, which is where Spiro believes that they are heading.

==Critical and scholarly reception==

In the film, Spiro Toiza rediscovers his Italian identity of Michele and at the end of the film believes the boat is headed to New York, while on the other hand Gino loses all materialistic indications that hes Italian and comes to look like another Albanian in a boat full of them. These two plot threads "challenge Italys colonial past and in so doing force the redefinition of the notion of identity. Who is Italian? And what does it mean to be Italian?" 

TV Guide gives the film four stars, finding it "A boldly chilling portrait of post-Communist Europe in moral eclipse, directed with passion and singular grace by Italian Gianni Amelio (STOLEN CHILDREN)."  Janet Maslin, writing for The New York Times, finds that "The films synthesis of fact and fiction is gracefully achieved," and expressed hope that after the screening of Lamerica at the 1995 New York Film Festival, Amelio would "emerge ... much more widely known."
