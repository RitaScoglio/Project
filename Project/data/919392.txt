James Clayton (Colin Farrell), a computer programming expert at Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT, is offered an interview by senior Central Intelligence Agency instructor Walter Burke (Al Pacino) for a position with the Agency. After witnessing a demonstration of Claytons skills, Burke tests Clayton with a puzzle encoded on the sports page of a newspaper. Clayton agrees to be recruited because he wants information about his missing father, whom he suspects was a CIA agent.
 polygraphic tests, The Farm, a CIA training facility. There, Burke and other instructors teach the candidates the skill sets of espionage, covert operation protocols, and intelligence gathering techniques. During a surveillance exercise, Clayton and fellow recruit Layla Moore (Bridget Moynahan) are kidnapped by men apparently from a foreign intelligence service. Clayton is tortured in a cell for several days but refuses to give up the names of his instructors. When the interrogators threaten to hurt Layla, Clayton gives in. The rear wall of the cell opens to reveal Burke, Layla, and the other recruits sitting in a lecture theater, having witnessed the whole event, which was a set-up. 

Clayton is cut from the program, but Burke arrives at his hotel room and claims that the dismissal itself was staged, and that Clayton has become a non-official cover (NOC), the most exclusive operative. Claytons first mission is to spy on Layla, whom Burke suspects is a mole, and who is trying to steal a computer virus from the headquarters. Burke gives Clayton a low-level desk job at the headquarters so he can get close to Layla. Clayton finds proof that Layla is removing the virus piece by piece using a USB flash drive.
 Union Station. After a brief scuffle, Clayton kills him and discovers that he was Zack (Gabriel Macht), a fellow recruit back at The Farm. When Clayton confronts Layla, she cries and protests that it was a security exercise, and that Zack was a NOC. Torn between two conflicting statements, Clayton decides to suspect Burke and trust Layla, believing her show of emotion to be genuine.

Clayton reports back to Burke, who congratulates Clayton on passing the final test. Clayton responds by demanding to know why Zack was killed, but Burke replies that Claytons gun was loaded with Blank (cartridge)|blanks, and that Zacks death was a ruse. However, Clayton tries to fire his gun, Burke deflects and shoots the rear window instead, proving that Burke is lying. Burke chases Clayton through an abandoned ware-house, and boasts that he organized the scheme to sell the virus for $3 million.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Reviews of the film were mixed. Review aggregation website   gave it an average score of 56 out of 100 from the 36 reviews it collected. 

Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review with B+, he stated, "From the get-go, The Recruit is one of those thrillers that delights in pulling the rug out from under you, only to find another rug below that."    Carla Meyer of San Francisco Chronicle also gave a positive review to the film, stating, "Pacino and Farrell bring a wary curiosity to their early scenes, with Farrell displaying a palpable hunger for praise and Pacino a corresponding mastery of how to hook somebody by parceling out compliments. Theyre a swarthier version of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt in Spy Game -- only The Recruit is more about mind games." 
 Mike Clark of USA Today gave a mixed review to the film, stating, "Nothing is ever what it seems, but still, nothings very compelling in The Recruit, a less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend."
