On the wedding night he discovers that he is incapable of consummating the marriage; he has become impotent. At the beginning, he suspects his two wives, without realizing that he walks by the true guilty party every day.

Scholar Aaron Mushengyezi writes: "I posit that in Xala, he evokes two problematic binary oppositions: between the corruption and decadence of foreign influence and the purity and morality of African tradition, the former represented as corrupting and the latter redemptive; and between strong, revolutionary masculine women and villainous, weak, feminine men."  

Another scholarly perspective is from Harriet D. Lyons: "I shall argue that in Sembenes work the "covertness" of the folk material takes the form of suppression of detail combined with the retention of essential values. Sembene is thereby able to use folk elements in such a way as to give the work political implications that go well beyond the preservation and/or revival of a local tradition. One can, therefore, examine the folk elements of Xala without fear of consigning yet another expression of African creativity to the museum of primitive art."
