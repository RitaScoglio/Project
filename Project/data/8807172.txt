==Plot==
Valluvanar (Avinash) is an upright political leader in Tamil Nadu much respected for his honesty and uprightness. And he refuses to compromise on this trait even when his only son Kamban (Uday Kiran) finds himself in jail for no fault of his.

The opposition party takes advantage of the situation and bails out Kamban, who joins this party much to his fathers embarrassment. The media laps it up sensationalizing it further. Then Kamban decides to leave the country until things cool down. Only his mother Vasuki with whom he is close is aware of this plan.

Kamban arrives at Sri Lanka where he be-friends Banerjee, a Bengali and Kamban stays with him. One day he finds a Tamil literary book on the beach which he traces to Shilpa the owner of the book. Shilpa (Vimala) is a college student preparing for the civil services examination.

The film juggles between reality and fiction, where Theepori, the fictitious father image of Kamban advises him to fall in love. That sets in rolling the love story as Kamban persists in wooing Shilpa.

She is staying with her brothers family. Shilpa is keen on realizing her ambitions and feels that love and marriage often comes in the way of womens career. The rest of the story is about the emotional conflict between her career and love.

===Reviews===
Rediff wrote:"Poi is a case in point -- you expect so much from Balachander, a genuine icon of Tamil filmdom; if you leave adulation aside, though, you have to say that his latest film disappoints".  Nowrunning wrote:"Poi lacks the marks of KBs earlier films".
