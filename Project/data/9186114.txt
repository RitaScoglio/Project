Labu and Labi come up with a plan to kidnap Murni in the middle of the night for an elopement, but they accidentally kidnap Murnis father, instead. Labu, Labi and Haji Bakhil are arrested and tried. Haji Bakhil is able to post his own bail, but he refuses to bail his servants. The film ends with Labu and Labi moaning their fate in prison.
