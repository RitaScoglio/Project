==Production notes==
 
Marineland of Florida played the part of the films Ocean Harbor Oceanarium. 

The Lobster House restaurant where the Creature kidnaps Lori Nelson was located in Jacksonville, FL. It was destroyed by fire in 1962. The Diamondhead Restaurant (now the River City Brewing Co.) was built adjacent to the site where the old Lobster House once stood. Friendship Park was built on the vacant land near where the Lobster House stood.  

During the attack by the Creature on the Lobster House, a clock hangs above the entrance that suddenly jumps ahead two hours during the Creatures attack. This is a continuity error resulting from the heat from the production equipment tripping the sprinkler system in the restaurant shortly after the scene started. The extras, mostly workers from the nearby Independent Life Insurance Company, were drenched, along with the production equipment, and the extras had to go home and change while the equipment was dried, which resulted in the time difference. 

The St. Johns River stood in for the Amazon in this movie. 

This film is the first screen role for Clint Eastwood, who appears uncredited as a lab technician named "Jennings" early in the story. He is shown having a discussion with Professor Ferguson, accusing a test subject cat of eating a lab rat, only to find that his character had in fact accidentally put the lab rat in his lab coat pocket.
