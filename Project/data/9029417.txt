With him, he brings some promises and the news of his impending death. He also meets and befriends his grandson Michael (Matthew Broderick). Donald Sutherland plays the police officer who helps Nora after her car is stolen and becomes her boyfriend in the process.

Kiefer Sutherland has a bit part, playing one of Michaels friends hanging around outside his high school. Kiefer shares no scene with his father.

Matthew Broderick was cast in this film and Simons play Brighton Beach Memoirs simultaneously.

The real-life father of Matthew Broderick (whose birthname is James Joseph Broderick), noted character actor James Broderick died (November 1, 1982) around the time of the making of this film. Co-star Jason Robards, who knew James and was a friend, helped Matthew through his grief over the loss of his father.

This was the last motion picture that Mason and Simon collaborated on before their divorce. Ironically, it was the only one of their films that failed at the box office.
