Take Cover! Repeat - Take Cover!". A bear and a moose fighting hear this and end up running. As a stampede of animals leave the jungle, Bugs is bathing in a nearby pond unaware that Taz has spotted him.

Disliking the taste of Bugs soap, Taz washes it off and puts ketchup on Bugs. Bugs thinks it is blood and freaks out, telling Taz to find a Physician|doctor. Taz runs to an infirmary, only to find Bugs dressed as a doctor instead. After a few checkup procedures, Bugs puts spotted glasses on Taz and asks him if he sees spots on his eyes and Taz says he does. Then Bugs gives him nitroglycerine and puts an electric belly firmer vibrating belt on Taz and Taz explodes.
 nurse and congratulates Taz and gives Taz a bundle presumably a baby boy. Taz gives Bugs a cigar and unwraps the baby which is actually a bomb. As Bugs walks away, the cigar that Taz gave him turns out to be an exploding cigar.

As Taz spins in, Bugs dressed as a surgeon calls Taz as his assistant. Bugs leaves the room and Taz looks at the patient. It ends up being a robotic Frankensteins monster which then grabs Taz and Offstage  he beats up Taz. Then in a backfiring moment, the robot heads for Bugs as the monster goes out of control. It ends with Bugs being beaten up by the monster off stage and both the dazed Bugs and Taz staggering back onscreen, bruised and bandaged. Bugs then asks if there is a doctor in the house.

==Edited versions==
* On CBS, the part where Bugs feeds Taz nitroglycerin and straps him to an exercise belt was cut to remove the close-up shot of the bottle of nitroglycerin and Bugs spoon-feeding it to Taz, but keeps in Bugs line about "a wonder drug that will make you as good as new" and Bugs strapping Taz to the exercise machine, making it look as if the exercise belt exploded because it was faulty. Also cut was Bugs as a maternity nurse giving Taz a bomb wrapped in baby blankets and Taz giving "Nurse" Bugs an exploding cigar.
* On ABC, the nitroglycerin/exercise belt part wasnt edited, but the baby bomb/exploding cigar part was cut.
