}} Steve Levitt, James Coco, Deborah Shelton and (a then-unknown) Brad Pitt in his film debut, as a cameo.

==Plot summary== Steve Levitt) is a nerd who has a hard time, working as a computer programmer, after his girlfriend dumps him for her aerobics instructor. He cant get along at work, in a crowd, or find love; but, he strikes up a deal with Dr. D (who happens to be the devil himself), (James Coco). If he serves the devil, he gets to be the "hunk" he always wanted to be, able to get any woman he wants. The price is that he becomes a servant of the devil and spreads evil, terror and death throughout eternity.

But, the voluptuous devils agent OBrien, (Deborah Shelton), gives Bradley a trial offer. He gets to live as Hunk Golden, (John Allen Nelson), a stud who has the perfect tanned body and he can eat a lot without gaining weight, drink without getting drunk, cavity proof teeth, etc., until Labor Day, when he has to finalize the deal. Bradley/Hunk seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Sunny Graves, (Rebeccah Bush), to try and save his old soul and body.

After Bradley/Hunk rescues television host Garrison Gaylord, (Robert Morse), and its caught on film by his television director, (J. Jay Saunders), Hunk becomes a celebrity. He has everything he ever dreamed of, and more. He now has it all, but he soon grows tired of the fame. He learns that all deals come with a price, and that being famous is not actually as glamorous and great as the fantasy once seemed to be. 

But, Bradley/Hunk is afraid that going back to being just Bradley may lose him all this, and his new girlfriend. Unbeknownst to himself, his girlfriend also has a deal with the devil, and is in trouble herself, if Bradley/Hunk does not go through with the deal.
