 Macular pucker". Native American psychic surgeons" to name a few, and the dangers of what surgery could bring, he decides to go through the other forms of medicine provided. This in turn takes him on a journey around the world and steers him away from surgery more so because of religious reasons, often in a dramatic and humorous fashion. 

This was the fourth and last of Grays theatrically released monologue films, following  .

The film is available on DVD and MiniDisc. A remastered version was released by The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray in June 2012. 

==Cast==
Spalding Gray was raised in Rhode Island and attended school in Massachusetts. Grays style as an actor was influenced by Allen Ginsberg, Ramblin Jack Elliot, and the American Autobiographical movement. He mostly worked in experimental theater. In 1977, he co-founded the Wooster Theater Group in New York City. Two years later he performed his first monologue: Sex and Death at the Age of 14. In the 80s Gray traveled to Thailand where he won two Independent Spirit Awards for the film Swimming to Cambodia. He appeared in several independent films in the 90s before Grays Anatomy was published. 

==Critical reception==
The San Francisco Chronicle described Grays Anatomy as an unremarkable story. "Theres something intrinsically insincere about the whole quest. This creeping sense that Gray isnt really interested in anything hes talking about - that he, alone, is the subject of his own obsession gives Grays Anatomy a distasteful edge." 

The Digital Fix described Grays Anatomy as "very witty and a pleasure to listen to. As he passes fifty, Gray starts to worry about his own death before he finds the sight in his left eye is becoming distorted. Learning that he has a macular pucker, Gray seeks out alternative therapies, including mass nude encounters in a sweatbox, a raw-vegetable diet and a trip to the Philippines to meet a psychic surgeon."  

The Chicago Tribune described Grays Anatomy as "demonstrating that fully stimulating the sense isnt the same as fully engaging them. The film begins as ordinary as could be and then continues with scenery changes, lighting effects, and moody music."
