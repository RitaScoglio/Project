==Plot==
Mamta (Reema Lagoo) dotes on Ramkishans (Alok Nath) eldest son Vivek, even though he is her step-son.  Vivek (Mohnish Behl) is disabled in one hand, because of a childhood accident, in which he had saved his brothers Prem (Salman Khan) and Vinod (Saif Ali Khan). This disability tends to put off most marriageable girls. Businessman Adarsh (Rajeev Verma)  and his daughter Sadhna (Tabu (actress)|Tabu) are impressed by the warmth and solidarity of Viveks family. This leads to a marriage between Vivek and Sadhna.

Preeti (Sonali Bendre), doctor by profession, and Prem (Salman Khan), a business student, have loved each other since they were children, but their feelings remain unspoken. The family announces their engagement soon after Vivek and Sadhanas wedding reception. The fun-loving and energetic pair, Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) and Sapna (Karishma Kapoor), also fall in love and get engaged. Ramkishan now feels that he can retire from the business and let his sons take over. He decides to appoint Vivek, the most experienced of his sons, the Managing Director (MD) of his companies.

The twist to the family saga comes when Ramkishans daughter Sangeeta (Neelam Kothari) and her husband Anand (Mahesh Thakur) are ousted by his elder brother Anurag from his house and business. Sapnas father Dharamraj (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) and three socialite friends of Mamta convince her that she must compel Ramkishan to divide the house and business equally among his sons, in order to avoid similar complications in her family. Troubled by Sangeetas misfortune, Mamta believes these arguments and begins to doubt her step-son Viveks loyalty. Sadhana and Vivek decide to go on a self-imposed exile to Rampur (the native village of Ramkishan). At Viveks insistence, a reluctant Prem takes over as the MD of the companies. However, Prem makes it clear that he considers Vivek the real leader and himself just a deputy.

Meanwhile, the absence of Anand and Sangeeta creates a huge vacuum in Anurags professional as well as domestic life. He realizes his mistake, and his wife takes the initiative to call them back. With peace restored in her marital home, Sangeeta now convinces Mamta to reconcile with Vivek and Sadhna. A repentant Mamta rushes to Rampur, just when Sadhana is giving birth to a baby boy. At the end, Vivek takes charge as MD of Ramkishans companies; meanwhile Prem and Preeti marry each other and so do Vinod and Sapna.
