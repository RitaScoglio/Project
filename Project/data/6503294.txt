==Plot== Christopher McDonald), by signing up for football, he will be sure to get it on his upcoming birthday. He enrolls on the football team and doggedly endures the practices, despite his disadvantage of being smaller than most his teammates. As Eddie predicted, Ward is glad Beaver signed up for football, as evidenced by a brief fantasy Ward has of Beaver making a touchdown while several professional football players all fail to tackle him. However, the first game of the season ends poorly when he passes the ball to a kid on the opposing team when he mistakingly remembered him as a friend from summer camp. On the first day of school five days later, Ward and June (Janine Turner) tell Wally to drop Beaver off and pick him up for a few days because he has never ridden his bike there before. At school he sits beside a very pretty girl named Susan Akatsu (Brenda Song) and has a kind teacher named Miss Landers (Grace Phillips). After school Eddie asks Wally to come to the soda shop to see him flirt with Karen (Erika Christensen). Eddie does not want Beaver to follow them, so Wally leaves him alone at the bike rack telling him he will be back in a second.

Beaver is polishing his bike when a punk teenage boy (Glenn Walker Harris Jr.) comes over, admires it, and asks him if he can show him some cool bike tricks. He agrees and the boy shows him some tricks before riding off with the bike. Inside the shop it becomes apparent that Karen likes Wally, not Eddie. When Wally and Eddie come out of the shop and hear that Beavers bike was stolen they look for it but cant find it. During dinner that night, the boys try to cover up the fact that the bike was stolen, but to no avail. When Ward hears this he is upset with Beaver, but angrier at Wally because he was responsible for watching Beaver. In the boys bedroom, they get into a fight which sends Beavers new computer flying out the window. Wally grabs the wire and tries to pull it in and does, but the wire breaks, and it falls out the window and crashes into many pieces.

Beaver decides to skip football practice and study instead, and Wally starts spending more time with Karen now instead of Beaver. Beaver catches up with the boy who stole his bike, who challenges him to a dangerous stunt to climb into a gigantic coffee mug atop the local cafe, but when he does so, the boy rides off again and he is stuck. The fire department and Ward help get him down, whereupon Ward realizes Beaver may be under too much pressure. Ward says he has found out about Beavers neglect of practices, but says he can quit the team if he wants. He, however, decides to go back to the team no matter how poorly he has been doing. During the last game, he gets a catch and runs it for a touchdown. At the Mayfield Festival, he chases after the boy who stole his bike and uses a concession stand to block his way and he ends up flying into a table of pies and slides down it with his face covered in pie and Beaver gets his bike back. At home, Ward sees him polishing it and he tells his dad that it would be safer if it stays in the house and he decides to read Beaver a bedtime story whereupon in the boys bedroom is a newspaper headline about the winning game, aptly titled "Leave It to Beaver".
