==Plot== British writer Bohemian movement. He encounters performers led by Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo); his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, "Spectacular Spectacular", that they wish to sell to Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), owner of the Moulin Rouge. The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his "Diamond Dog Dancers" perform for the audience ("Lady Marmalade/Zidlers Rap (Can Can)/Smells Like Teen Spirit"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), a potential investor in the cabaret ("Sparkling Diamonds" medley).
 Rhythm of confession ("Like Like a Come What May").
 The Show Must Go On"). Christian tries following her, but is denied entry to the Moulin Rouge, and becomes depressed, even though Toulouse insists that Satine does love him.

The night of the show, Christian sneaks into the Moulin Rouge, intending to pay Satine to return his love just as the Duke paid for her ("Hindi Sad Diamonds"). He catches Satine before she steps on stage and demands she tell him she does not love him. Suddenly they find themselves in the spotlight; Zidler convinces the audience that Christian is the sitar player in disguise. Christian denounces Satine and walks off the stage. From the rafters, Toulouse cries out, "The greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return", spurring Satine to sing the song Christian wrote to express their love. Christian returns to the stage, joining her in the song. The Duke orders his bodyguard to kill Christian, but is thwarted, while the Dukes own attempt is stopped by Zidler. The Duke storms out of the cabaret as Christian and Satine complete their song ("Come What May (Reprise)", "Coup dÉtat (Finale)").

After the curtain closes, Satine succumbs to tuberculosis. Before she dies, Christian and Satine affirm their love and she tells him to write their story. A year later the Moulin Rouge has closed down, and Christian is writing the tale of his love for Satine, a "love that will live forever" ("Nature Boy (Reprise)").

==Production==
===Writing=== Alexandre Dumas, fils The Lady of the Camellias, although Luhrmann, as an opera director, was probably more directly influenced by Verdis adaptation, La traviata.

When asked about his inspiration for Moulin Rouge!, Luhrmann remarked:
 

Luhrmann revealed that he drew from the Greek tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice in the DVDs audio commentary. The legend of Orpheus says he was a musical genius, far surpassing anyone in his world; the filmmakers chose to replicate this by using songs from the mid-to-late 20th century, many decades after the films 1899 setting. In this way, Christian would appear to the other characters to be ahead-of-his-time as a musician and writer.

===Development===
Leonardo DiCaprio, who worked with Luhrmann on Romeo + Juliet, auditioned for the role of Christian.  Luhrmann also considered younger actors for the role, including Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal before Ewan McGregor won the part. Courtney Love auditioned for Satine and assisted in clearing licensing rights for "Smells Like Teen Spirit" to be used in the film. 

===Filming=== McGregor also starred). This necessitated some Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up shots being filmed in Madrid.
 China Gate, The Show Nature Boy", cover commissioned Like a titular number tango format using the composition "Tanguera" by Mariano Mores), and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana (band)|Nirvana, a song rarely used in films. The film uses so much popular music that it took Luhrmann almost two years to secure all the rights to the songs.

==Release and reception== premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival    on 9 May – making it the festivals opening title.

Moulin Rouge! received generally positive reviews from critics.
 Film 2001.

 Best Actress Best Picture. Best Director Best Costume Best Art Direction.

"Come What May" (the only original song in the film) was disqualified from nomination for an Oscar because it was originally written (but unused) for Luhrmanns previous film Romeo + Juliet and not written expressly for Moulin Rouge! 

Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "Baz Luhrmanns trippy pop culture pastiche from 2001 was an aesthetically arresting ode to poetry, passion, and Elton John. It was so good, well forgive him for Australia (2008 film)|Australia."
