==Plot==
Dhanakpur village farmer, Thakur Jaswant Singh (Alok Nath) and Dhanraj Singh (Dalip Tahil) are brothers. They have a younger sister Madhumati, who was used, made pregnant and ditched by Ratan Singh (played by Arjun), the son of Thakur Raghuveer Singh from a big Rajput family. The family refuses Jaswant Singhs request to get his sister married to Ratan. Ratans family refuses to accept that he is guilty, as they are interested in their status. Insulted, Jaswant decides to leave the village. Unable to tolerate the events, Madhumati commits suicide. Frustrated, Dhanraj kills Ratan at his wedding and gets imprisoned. The two families are now bitter enemies. Jaswant moves to Delhi, develops his business, and reaches good status; he also raises Dhanrajs kids. Years later, Dhanraj gets released from the prison. Upon release, Dhanraj receives a letter from his son, Raj (Aamir Khan), an ardent music-lover, who completes his education in Rajput College. An emotional Dhanraj sneaks into Rajs college farewell party and is glad to see his son fulfill his dreams.

In a twist of fate, Raj and his buddy go to Dhanakpur to clear his familys land deal. While returning home, Raj falls for Rashmi (Juhi Chawla), a relative of Raghuveer Singh. Raj sneaks into Rashmis birthday bash. The two meet again at a holiday spot. They become lost in the forest and fall in love while finding a way out together. Raj finds out about Rashmis family but is unable to tell her the truth. When Randhir Singh, Rashmis father, finds out about the affair, he immediately arranges Rashmis wedding. The two lovers take on their families and elope, dreaming of an idyllic life together.

Furious, Randhir hires a contract killer to kill Raj. The lovers have a brief interval of happiness. They stay in a deserted fort, happy in their own paradise. When Randhir gets to know their whereabouts, he goes there to bring Rashmi home and ensure that Raj is killed. Randhirs mother does not wish for this so she goes to Dhanraj and tells him to save them. Raj leaves the fort to bring some wood for their house. While Raj is away, Randhir meets with Rashmi and tells her to come home; he has "accepted their love". Rashmi is overjoyed at her fathers words, not knowing the truth. In the forest, Raj is chased by the henchmen.

Dhanraj reaches the fort and repeatedly asks him about his sons whereabouts. They get in a fight and a gunshot is heard. Rashmi leaves the scene to make sure that Raj is okay. He is just about to be shot, but on seeing Rashmi, the henchman shoots her instead. She is shot twice and rolls down the hill. Raj overpowers the henchman and reaches Rashmis side, crying. They promise never to leave each other. On saying this, Rashmi breathes her last in Rajs arms. A grief-stricken Raj is devastated by Rashmis death, and says that nothing can separate them. He commits suicide with a dagger given to him by Rashmi, and dies with his head on Rashmis chest. The final scene is both families running toward them; the lovers are together, never to be separated, as the sun sets behind them.
