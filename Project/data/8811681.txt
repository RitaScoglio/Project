==Summary==
Beni is an eight-year-old boy living in Korçë with his parents. Beni leads a sheltered life. His mother is very protective and doesnt let him play outside. When Beni is able to go outside, the neighborhood children make fun of him, often calling him a "scaredy cat" and a "mamas boy." One day when his uncle Thomai is visiting, he sees Beni crying after the other children took his horse. Thomai decides to take Beni on horseback to a distant village where he teaches him about life and how to be a man. In the village Beni learns a great deal and blossoms into a mature boy. On the way back to the city Beni doesnt need to ride on horseback, he is able to walk all the way home on his own.
