}} play of the same name (both written by James Goldman) starring George C. Scott and Joanne Woodward. Occasionally cited mistakenly as a Broadway play, it never in fact opened in the USA.

 psychoanalyzing him, Doctor Watson to his Holmes.

The duo then begin an enigmatic quest for Moriarty, with Playfair/Holmes following all manner of bizarre and (to Watson) unintelligible clues, and the two growing closer to each other in the process.

==Defining quote==
The title is an indirect reference to Don Quixotes famous exploit of tilting at windmills, believing them to be "monstrous giant (mythology)|giants". Despite the protest of his aide Sancho Panza and being soundly defeated at the hands of the "giants"  (that is, being tossed away by a mills sail after getting his lance caught up in it), Quixote maintains his belief that the mills are not buildings but giants. In reference to this, Playfair argues:
 the world bread mould might be medicine. If we never looked at things and thought of what they might be, why, wed all still be out there in the tall grass with the apes. 

==Critical views==
The film opened to mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times described it as "a mushy movie with occasional, isolated moments of legitimate comedy."  Leonard Maltin was a notable critic to hold it in good esteem. 

It has a 78% positive rating from 9 reviews on the movie-review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes. 

==Releases==

An edited for television version in 1986 was 96:29. The currently-available on-demand DVD runs only slightly over 84 minutes; all the edited versions omit the penultimate scene in the grocery store.
