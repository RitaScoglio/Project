 1937 Merrie Piggy and the Hamhock family, in what would be Piggys final appearance in the Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes repertory in the Golden Age of American animation.

== Synopsis == Piggy Hamhock (not to be confused with Porky Pig) is always hungry, thinking of food, eating, and stealing food when he can. And no matter how much he eats, he never fills up.

When his mother leaves a pair of pies out to cool, Piggy swipes a pie from the windowsill and spins it around his finger as he eats it; he tries to eat a second pie in the same manner, but his mother catches him in time and he accidentally chomps on his bare fingers. He is scolded by his mother, but he ignores her and begins daydreaming about food. That afternoon, his mother serves spaghetti for dinner.  While the family says grace, he ties all of their spaghetti strands together, so that he can devour all the spaghetti (enough to feed a family of eight) in a single slurp. His mother scolds him again, but he takes no heed.

As the other pigs sleep, he is awake, in deep thought of food, then falls asleep.  The next morning, he finds himself invited into the home of a kindly, hiccuping old man (voiced by Billy Bletcher, better known for the voice of Paw Bear in some later Warners toons and of Pete in the Disney cartoons). The old man asks Piggy if he is hungry and presents Piggy with a table laid out with a full-blown feast – complete with a roasted turkey. Overjoyed at the mans generosity, Piggy sits down, rubbing his belly in anticipation.  At that moment the man shoves the table of food out of Piggys reach as the cover of the chair is pulled out from under him.  A leather belt across his arms and chest straps him in place as a robotic arm swings around to take hold of his nose.  The man shows himself to be some sort of mad scientist declaring, "So, its food you want!?  Ha, ha! (Hic) Well give you plenty of it!"

The scene switches to the basement, revealing the Feed-A-Matic; a bizarre machine built for the sole purpose of force-feeding hungry little kids like Piggy (not that he would need any forcing) in order to make them really fat. The scientist rushes down to activate the controls, yelling, "So, you love food, (hic) eh?", and goes straight to his work.

The chair Piggy is strapped into first carries him to a huge vat (labeled "SUPER SOUP FEEDER") filling with gallons of soup from cans; the mechanical arm then pulls on Piggys nose forcing his mouth open to let in a torrent of soup through a feeder shaped like a Pelton wheel but with spoons as buckets.  He is then fed bananas popped out of their skins down his throat like bullets. Next to follow are stops at a gumball machine that doles out olives and at a conveyor belt of ice cream cones dispensing ice cream via a bellows.  Then comes the main course, a sandwich as big as a king-sized bed (featuring the first appearance of Freleng’s "hold the onions" gag), followed by dessert dispensed from the "PIE-A-TROPE" -- pies spinning on the spindle of a converted jukebox.
 extremely obese, food-packed ball. Fed like never before in his life, Piggy is clearly happy with what has happened to him. Smiling at the sight of Piggy’s new-found obesity, the scientist pokes his obese guest twice and kindly asks "Have enough, my boy?"  To which Piggy replies "Y-y-y-yes sir!"  The scientist then unstraps him, commenting "Why, youre not half full!" and laughs evilly as he watches the newly and extremely greatly obese pig leave.

With the sun setting, Piggy waddles to the door, passing by the food the scientist had laid out to bait him earlier. Looking at the turkey he delights at the prospect of more food.  He pulls off a Drumstick (poultry)|drumstick, takes a bite, and explodes.

Or rather, he wakes up screaming in his own bed – it was only a Dream sequence|dream. Then hearing the sound of his mother calling him to breakfast, he dashes downstairs and starts eating with more gusto than ever before.

== Notes ==
* The animation appears crude by later Warner standards and contains some goofs.
** Piggy’s design includes a set of distinctive birthmarks on him; in the beginning, he has 3 – one on his head, one on his rear-end, and one on his right knee.  Throughout the rest of the film, he has only the ones on his head and rear-end.
** During the scene where Piggy and his family are having dinner, when they first sit down at the table, all of the plates on it are empty. When the family says grace, however, the plates are filled with spaghetti.
** The birthmark on his head keeps changing sides.
** At the end, when the scientist is letting him go, he is standing behind Piggy, yet (for a moment) his toe is in front of Piggy’s fat belly.
* This film was the second (and last) featuring the Family Hamhock, which Friz Freleng had apparently intended as a series of recurring characters. They made their first appearance in At Your Service Madame  – this presented Mrs. Hamhock as a widow to whom her late husband had left a sizable inheritance.  Rooted in the concept of morality, each of her 7 children embodied one of the Seven Deadly Sins; Piggy, of course, represented gluttony and was a clean freak. Leon Schlesinger didnt like this idea and Mrs. Hamhocks children would never appear again after this film.  Mrs. Hamhock herself would make one last appearance in what would have been the next short in the series, "Wholly Smoke" (1938), with Porky Pig cast as her only child.
* The scene at the end of Piggy leaping out of bed to dash downstairs to breakfast was reused footage of the shot that first introduced him in "At Your Service Madame".
* Pigs Is Pigs is considered significant because it is the first ever appearance of Freleng "hold the onions" gag.
* Some aspects of Piggy and his family were revived by Steven Spielberg in his Tiny Toon Adventures animated series.  The character of Hamton J. Pig and his parents are a clear reflection of the Hamhocks.  Like Piggy, Hamton has an incessant appetite and is a clean freak.
* This short appears in the  ".
* A clip of this short was seen as a Toonami montage for its 10th anniversary.
