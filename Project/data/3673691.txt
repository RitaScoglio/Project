A down-on-her-luck would-be singer keeps encountering roadblocks on her way to stardom. Judy Alvin (Martha Tilton) has a fine voice but is no match for the politics of a musical producer pushing his girlfriend, the amazingly untalented Phoebe (Betty Brodel, the sister of Joan Leslie) who has obtained employment by using a record of Judys voice rather than hers.

Living at a theatrical boarding house with a variety of eccentric entertainers, Judys best friend Marge (Irish Adrian) is determined to find Judy a job to pay her bills that has something, anything, to do with music.  A chance encounter with a Rock-Ola 3701 Master   telephone juke box.   gets Judy employment at the company where he duties involve taking telephone calls from patrons of a bar selecting music to hear over loud speakers.
