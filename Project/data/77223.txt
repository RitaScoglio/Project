==Plot==
Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-professional tennis player, lives in a ground floor flat with his socialite wife, Margot (Grace Kelly). Tony retired after Margot complained about his busy schedule and had begun an affair with American crime-fiction writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), which Tony secretly discovered. Tony devises a plan to have Margot murdered.
 Cambridge University, C. A. Swann (Anthony Dawson), who has become a criminal. Tony has secretly been following Swann so he can blackmail him into murdering Margot. Tony tells Swann about Margots affair, including a love letter from Mark which she once kept in her handbag. Six months ago, Tony stole the handbag and anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony offers to pay him £1,000 to kill Margot; if Swann refuses, Tony will turn him in to the police as Margots blackmailer.

At 11 pm Tony will telephone and Margot will go to the phone. Swann must kill her, open the French doors, leave signs suggesting a burglary gone wrong, and exit through the front door, hiding the key again.

Tonys watch stops, and he phones the flat later than intended. Swann has already put the key back after entering. He tries to strangle Margot with his scarf, but she stabs him with a pair of scissors, killing him. She picks up the telephone receiver and pleads for help. Tony tells her not to do anything. At home, he calls the police and sends Margot to bed. Tony then moves what he thinks is Margots latchkey from Swanns pocket into her handbag, plants Marks letter on Swann, persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police, and destroys Swanns knotted scarf, replacing it with Margots own stocking in an attempt to incriminate her.

Mark hides in the bedroom and Hubbard asks about money Tony has been spending, tricks him into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and asks him about an attaché case. Tony claims to have lost the case, but Mark sees it on the bed, full of cash. Mark stops Hubbard from leaving and explains his theory. Hubbard says he prefers Tonys story, but after Mark leaves, Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tonys, and as soon as Tony leaves, he uses Tonys key to re-enter the flat. Hubbard has already discovered that the key in Margots handbag was Swanns latchkey.

Mark returns, and police officers release Margot. She tries to unlock the door with the key in her purse, then enters through the garden, proving she is unaware of the hidden key. Hubbard has the handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. The key from Margots bag does not work, so he uses the hidden key to open the door, proving his guilt. His escape routes blocked by Hubbard and another policeman, Tony makes himself a drink, and admits defeat.
