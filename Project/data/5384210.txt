 Filipino science action comedy film made in 2004 directed by Erik Matti and starring Vhong Navarro. It is of the same ilk as the Spider-Man films, with a mutated spider that causes Gagamboy to gain his superpowers.

==Plot==
Junie (Vhong Navarro), is an ice cream vendor, who goes around selling ice cream to children, and adults alike. After his shift, Junie gets in a predicament with a rival vendor Dodoy (Jay Manalo). Their manager, angered by their actions, demotes Junie to a warehouse guard. Dodoy celebrates, only to be demoted too, working a different shift than that of Junie. Junie goes home in a bad mood, until he sees the love of his life, Liana (Aubrey Miles). After dinner, Junie gets ready to sleep, to work a new job the next day. While on the job, Junie accidentally swallows a spider, thus giving him web slinging abilities, and becoming Gagamboy. After his shift, Dodoy comes in to his work, and leaves a sandwich unprotected. A roach slips into his sandwich, and as he eats it, he collapses, only to regain consciousness as a large roach. He hires two henchmen, and calls himself, Ipisman (Cockroachman). Junie and Dodoy, both try to win Lianas love. Dodoy practically gives up, only to return as Ipisman, to kidnap Liana to lure Gagamboy to his lair. There, he plans to finish off Gagamboy, but the tables turned and Dodoy was destroyed.
