With the help of the trio, she has a boy, whom she names Robert William Pedro after her benefactors. Before dying, she extracts a promise from his three godfathers that they will take care of him. Moved by her plight, the three desperados uphold their promise despite the acute lack of water.
 salt flat, William dies of exhaustion and the effects of his injury; later, Pete falls and breaks his leg. Robert leaves him his pistol, for "protection from coyotes." As he walks away, he hears a single gunshot.

Finally at the end of his strength, Robert nearly loses hope, but in his delirium the ghosts of his two friends appear and refuse to let him give up. He finally reaches New Jerusalem and enters a cantina where people are singing Christmas carols, and then collapses right after Sheriff Sweet catches up with him. He is arrested, but because of his heroism and refusal to give up custody of his godson in favor of the Sweets (whom he has now befriended), he is viewed by the townspeople as a hero even before the trial comes to its conclusion.
