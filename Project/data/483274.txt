==Plot summary== FBI Agent. veteran Angelo undercover to DEA undercover operation.
 moons everyone in the same manner one of the robbers does when leaving a bank. He tails Bodhi and his suspicions are confirmed when he sees Bodhi and Roach casing a bank. Utah and Pappas stake out the bank and the Ex-Presidents appear. Bodhi, wearing a Reagan mask, leads Utah on a furious foot chase through the neighborhood, which ends when Utah, by jumping into an Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct, causes the knee injury that ended his playing career to flare up again. Despite having a clear shot at Bodhi (locking eyes with him), Utah cannot bring himself to shoot—instead unloading his clip into the sky in frustration—and Bodhi escapes.

At a camp-fire that night, it is confirmed that Bodhi and his gang are the Ex-Presidents. Their primary motivation is not profit, but rebelling against the system. Knowing Utahs true identity, most of the gang want out but Bodhi refuses to fold. The next morning, Bodhi aggressively recruits Johnny into going skydiving with the group. Utah, still without proof of Bodhis crimes, tags acquiesces. After the jump, Bodhi reveals that he knows Utah is an FBI agent and has arranged for his friend Rosie, a non-surfing thug, to hold Tyler hostage. Utah is thus blackmailed into participating in the Ex-Presidents last bank robbery of the summer. During the robbery Bodhi breaks his own rule by going for the money in the vault, taking too much time. As a result, Grommet, along with an off-duty police officer and a security guard who try to stop the robbery, are killed. Angered by Grommets death and by having to kill the police off, Bodhi knocks Utah out and leaves him at the scene.

Defying their senior officer, Pappas and Utah go to the airport where Bodhi, Roach, and Nathaniel are about to leave for Mexico, where Rosie is awaiting them with Tyler. During a shoot-out, Pappas and Nathaniel are killed, and Roach is seriously wounded. The pilot reveals the groups destination within Utahs earshot, jeopardizing their escape plans. With Roach aboard, Bodhi forces Utah onto the plane at gunpoint. Once airborne and over their intended drop zone at , Bodhi and Roach put on their parachutes and jump from the plane, leaving Utah to take the blame again. With no other parachutes available, Utah jumps from the plane with Bodhis gun, managing to intercept him before he lands, but Bodhi forces him to drop the gun so he can open their parachute and land safely. Upon impact, Utahs knee gives out again, allowing Bodhi to escape Utahs grasp. Bodhi meets with Rosie and releases Tyler. Roach dies of his wounds and Bodhi and Rosie leave with the money.

Nine months later, a long-haired Utah, still surfing, tracks down Bodhi at Bells Beach in Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia, where a record storm is producing lethal waves. This is an event Bodhi had talked about experiencing, calling it the "50-Year Storm". During a brawl in the surf, Utah manages to handcuff himself to Bodhi. Bodhi begs Utah to release him so he can ride the once-in-a-lifetime wave. Knowing he will not come back alive, Utah releases him, bids him farewell and sees him step towards the wave. While the authorities watch Bodhi surf to his death. Utah walks away, throwing his FBI badge into the ocean.

==Production==
Originally, Matthew Broderick, Johnny Depp, Val Kilmer and Charlie Sheen were all considered to star in Point Break playing the character Johnny Utah with Ridley Scott directing.    Cinefile

 Blue Steel and was looking for her next project. 
 the famous its relevance to surfing.  This is Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayzes second movie together, they had appeared together before in 1986s Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood.

Reeves liked the name of his character as it reminded him of star athletes like Johnny Unitas and Joe Montana.    He described his character as a "total control freak and the ocean beats him up and challenges him. After a while everything becomes a game...He becomes as amoral as any criminal. He loses the difference between right and wrong."  Swayze felt that Bodhi was a lot like him and that they both shared "that wild-man edge." 

Two months before filming, Lori Petty, Reeves, and Swayze trained with former world class professional surfer Dennis Jarvis on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.  Jarvis remembers, "Patrick said hed been on a board a couple of times, Keanu definitely had not surfed before, and Lori had never been in the ocean in her life."    Shooting the surfing sequences proved to be challenging for both actors with Swayze cracking four of his ribs. For many of the surfing scenes he refused to use a stunt double as he never had one for fight scenes or car chases. He also did the skydiving scenes himself and the films aerial jump instructor Jim Wallace found that the actor was a natural and took to it right away.  The actor ended up making 55 jumps for the film.    Swayze actually based aspects of his character after one of his stunt doubles, Darrick Doerner, a top big wave surfer.    After learning to surf for the film, Reeves took a liking to it and took it up as a hobby.

==Reception==

===Box office=== 101 Dalmatians and Boyz n the Hood. With a budget of $24 million, the film went on to make $43.2 million in North America and $40.3 million internationally for a worldwide total of $83.5 million.   

===Critical response===
The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics.   gave the film a "C+" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote "Point Break makes those of us who dont spend our lives searching for the ultimate physical rush feel like second-class citizens. The film turns reckless athletic valor into a new form of aristocracy."   

In his review for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson wrote "A lot of what Bigelow puts up on the screen bypasses the brain altogether, plugging directly into our viscera, our gut. The surfing scenes in particular are majestically powerful, even awe-inspiring. Bigelows picture is a feast for the eyes, but we watch movies with more than our eyes. She seduces us, then asks us to be bimbos."    Rolling Stone magazines Peter Travers wrote, "Bigelow cant keep the film from drowning in a sea of surf-speak. But without her, Point Break would be no more than an excuse to ogle pretty boys in wet suits."   

USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and Mike Clark wrote "Its purely visceral material (surf sounds, skydiving stunt work, a tough indoor shootout midway through) are first-rate. As for the tangibles that matter even more (script, acting, directorial control, credible relationships between characters), Break defies belief. Dramatically, it rivals the lowest surf yet this year."    Time (magazine)|Time magazines Richard Corliss wrote, "So how do you rate a stunningly made film whose plot buys so blithely into macho mysticism that it threatens to turn into an endless bummer? Looks 10, Brains 3."   

Some critics argue that the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious is a copy of Point Break, swapping surfing for illegal street car racing. 

In 2006, a special edition was released on DVD. Entertainment Weekly gave it a "B" rating and wrote, "The making-of docs (at their best discussing Swayzes extracurricular skydiving—that really is him doing the Adios, amigo fall) will leave you hanging."    It was first released on Blu-ray as a special "Pure Adrenaline Edition" on July 1, 2008, but that was later discontinued. Point Break was re-released on Blu-ray by Warner Home Video on June 14, 2011.

===Accolades===
At the 1992 MTV Movie Awards, Point Break was nominated for three awards including "Most Desirable Male" (Keanu Reeves), "Most Desirable Male" (Patrick Swayze), and "Best Action Sequence" for the second jump from the plane. In it, Agent Utah jumps out of a plane without a parachute to catch Bodhi and rescue Tyler. Utah catches up with Bodhi and holds a gun to his head. However, Bodhi refuses to pull the rip cord and Utah must decide between dropping his gun (so he can hold on and pull the rip cord) or letting the two fall to the ground. The film ultimately won "Most Desirable Male" for Keanu Reeves.

==Legacy== I Love the 90s on the episode "I Love 1991|1991". Many celebrities, including Dominic Monaghan, Mo Rocca, Michael Ian Black, Hal Sparks, and Chris Pontius commented about the movie and why it deserved to be included in the episode. Entertainment Weekly ranked Point Break as having one of the "10 Best Surfing Scenes" in cinema.   

The film inspired a piece of cult theater, Point Break Live!, in which the role of Johnny Utah is played by an audience member chosen by popular acclamation after a brief audition. The new "Keanu" reads all of his (or her) lines from cue-cards for the duration of the show, "to capture the rawness of a Keanu Reeves performance even from those who generally think themselves incapable of acting."   

Point Break was referenced in Hot Fuzz, where the iconic scene of Utah emptying his clip into the sky in frustration is watched by the lead characters and later re-enacted by Nick Frosts character.  

The scene in which Utah jumps after Bodhi without a parachute was ranked seventh in Empire (magazine)|Empire magazines Top 10 Crazy Action Sequences. The scene was also tested by the Discovery Channel series MythBusters. It was determined that Utah and Bodhi would not have been able to free-fall for 90 seconds (as in the film), nor would they have been able to hold a conversation in mid-air. However, it was determined that, by streamlining his body, Utah could have conceivably caught up with Bodhi after jumping from the plane. 

==Remake==
  remake of the film, written by Kurt Wimmer,  and directed by Ericson Core.  The film stars are Luke Bracey, Ray Winstone, and Edgar Ramirez.     The film is set for a December 25, 2015 release.
