| }} British comedy Hugh Sinclair, Edward Rigby, and Anthony Newley. Produced by Betty Box during her stint at Gainsborough Pictures, it was written by Robert Westerby. 

  The plot, a variation on The Ransom of Red Chief, revolves around Sheila Farlaine (Clark), the teenaged daughter of Shakespearean tragedian Michael Farlaine (Sinclair), who is kidnapped by elderly crook Harry Denton (Rigby) when its suggested he no longer has what it takes to be a master criminal. 
 egotistical fathers career - becomes the mastermind of the plot and resists every effort made by Harrys grandson Jack (Hanley) to return her home before shes discovered missing. Newley is Sheilas boyfriend Jimmy, a potential juvenile delinquent and general nuisance to one and all.

Taking advantage of Clarks vocal abilities, screenwriter Westerby included two scenes in which she sang the tune "Its Not for the Want of Trying" by songwriters Jack Fishman and Peter Hart.

The film, Clarks twelfth, allowed her to play a role more mature than she had in previous outings, and was both a critical and commercial success.
