==Plot==
  Flaming Youth ), and takes it to a publisher in Los Angeles by train.

The same day, a rich young socialite named Mary Buckingham (Ralston) has her automobile break down in Little Bend and boards the same train.  No dogs are allowed aboard, so she hides her Pekinese under her shawl, but her pet jumps off as the train pulls away.  Harold rescues her dog and helps Mary hide it from the conductor. She sees his manuscript, so he starts telling her about his book, overcoming his stuttering in his enthusiasm.  They become so absorbed in each other that neither realizes that the train has reached its final destination and everyone else has departed.  Upon returning home, Mary rejects the latest in a string of proposals of marriage from her persistent but insincere suitor, Ronald DeVore, a rich man who is almost twice her age and who obviously views Mary as merely a trophy wife.

After her car is repaired, Mary intentionally detours through Little Bend repeatedly, hoping to meet Harold again.  On one such trip, Ronald is also along for the ride, and his unwanted attentions during yet another unsuccessful marriage proposal cause the flustered Mary to accidentally swerve off the road and get her car stuck near the outskirts of Little Bend.  While Ronald walks back to town for a tow, Mary serendipitously runs into Harold, who is relaxing in a rowboat in a nearby stream, and dreaming about her. After telling Mary about the remainder of his book, Harold informs Mary that he is going to see the publisher, Roger Thornby, in a few days to deliver a new chapter for his book that he plans to write about her, and they agree to meet again afterward. Meanwhile, back in town, Ronald unexpectedly runs into a middle-aged woman who asks if he is finally going to take her home with him and introduce her to his family, but he stalls her with vaguely-worded excuses, then rides away in the tow-vehicle.

Mr. Thornbys professional readers find Harolds book hilariously absurd, so he informs Harold that it has been rejected. Without any royalty money, Harold figures he cannot ask a rich girl like Mary to marry him.  So when he next sees Mary, Harold, too ashamed to tell her the truth, pretends that he was only using her as part of his research, and that he really is not interested in her.  Heartbroken and lonesome, Mary impulsively agrees to marry Ronald even though she has never really liked him.  Afterward, though, one of Mr. Thornbys senior employees convinces the publisher that, if the staff liked the book so much, there must be a market for it, so Thornby decides to publish the book after retitling it "The Boobs Diary", a spoof on the popular romantic-advice books of the time .

Back in the tailor shop a few days later, a depressed Harold sees an envelope from the publisher that arrives in the mail along with the morning newspaper, but he just rips it up without even opening it, assuming that it is merely a formal rejection notice.  Fortunately, his uncle notices that one of the scraps is part of an advance royalty check for $3,000; the envelope also contains a letter that informs Harold that his book will be published as a comedy.  At first, Harold is outraged and insulted to have his "pride and joy" ridiculed, but then he quickly swallows his indignation upon realizing that the royalty money means that he could probably propose to Mary after all.  His elation is short-lived, however, when he sees a newspaper headline announcing Mary and Ronalds wedding which is scheduled for that same day at her familys estate.  Thinking all is lost, Harold gives up.  However, by chance, the same woman whom Ronald had met in town a few days earlier walks in and, seeing the newspaper story, tearfully exclaims that she is Ronalds wife.  As proof, she shows Harold a photo locket with the couples wedding portrait and the engraved words "to my wife" that Ronald had given her two years earlier.

Eventually arriving at Buckingham Estate with only moments to spare, Harold bursts in just as the minister is about to conclude the wedding ceremony, but he cannot stop stuttering long enough to expose Ronalds intended bigamy.  So Harold whisks Mary up over his shoulder and carries her off.  When they are alone, he tells her about Ronalds dishonesty and shows her the locket as proof.  Mary, visibly relieved that she wont have to marry the snobbish Ronald after all, and immensely grateful for Harolds heroic dash to save her from scandal, quickly forgives Harolds previous deceptions now that she sees that he truly did care about her all along, and she gets Harold to propose to her (with an assist from a passing mail-carriers whistle to stop his stuttering), and she accepts.

==Production==
This was Lloyds first independent production after his split with Hal Roach.  It is what Lloyd called a "character story" (as opposed to a "gag film"), and is notable for containing fewer of the stunts which characterize Lloyds other films throughout most of its length, and instead focusing more on the relationship between Lloyd and Ralston.  However, the lengthy finale of the film is one of the most exhilarating, non-stop action sequences of Lloyds career.

It was also the second of six consecutive movies pairing Harold Lloyd and Jobyna Ralston, who left Hal Roach Studios as well to continue working with Lloyd.  Unlike the normal style for filmed romances prior to Girl Shy, both Ralston and Lloyd were featured in comedic scenes.

The exterior shots of the "Buckingham" mansion and gardens were filmed at Harold Lloyd Estate|Lloyds own Greenacres estate in Beverly Hills.
