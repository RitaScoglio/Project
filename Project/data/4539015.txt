 1974 film Thieves Like Us by Edward Anderson, which was also the source material for the 1949 film They Live by Night, directed by Nicholas Ray.  The supporting cast includes Louise Fletcher and Tom Skerritt.

The film was entered into the 1974 Cannes Film Festival.   

==Plot summary==
Bowie, a youthful convicted murderer, and bank robbers Chicamaw and T-Dub escape from a Mississippi chain gang in the 1930s. They hole up with a gas station attendant and continue robbing banks.

Bowie, who is injured in an auto accident, takes refuge with the daughter of the gas station attendant, Keechie. They become romantically involved but their relationship is strained by Bowies refusal to turn his back on crime.

Chicamaw is eventually recaptured and T-Dub is killed while waiting in his car for his wife. Bowie poses as a sheriffs deputy to spring Chickamaw from jail. But he quickly becomes disgusted with the violent, raving Chicamaw and abandons him on the side of the road.

The Texas Rangers catch up with Bowie, who is betrayed by a motel keeper. He meets a violent end. Keechie carries on, pregnant with Bowies baby. (In Andersons novel, she too is killed by the Texas Rangers.)

==Production notes== diegetic music or "source music," usually presented as coming from a radio.

The film features a large number of small-town people as extras, including Lloyd Jones, an actual Mississippi State Highway Patrolman. 

==Earlier film version==
Thieves Like Us differs from They Live By Night by being filmed largely on location in Mississippi, while the earlier movie was filmed primarily in a studio. The Bowie and Keechie characters in Thieves Like Us do not get married, and Bowies innocence is not asserted as aggressively as in They Live By Night.
