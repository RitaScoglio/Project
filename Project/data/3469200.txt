March on Rome ( ) is a 1962 comedy film by Dino Risi with Vittorio Gassman and Ugo Tognazzi, aimed at describing the March on Rome of Benito Mussolinis black shirts from the point of view of two newly recruited, naïve black shirts.

The movies main theme is the gradual betrayal of all the promises of the   flyer every time they are contradicted by practice. In its early stages fascism was a radical republican movement, suspicious of large businesses, nobility and the Catholic Church (Mussolini himself had been a socialist early in his career, being cast out of the Italian Socialist Party when his nationalism grew more and more pronounced). When arriving in Rome, and having ticked them all off, they leave the fascist party in the moment of its victory.

==Plot summary==
The film is set in Rome in 1922. Two friends returning from the First World War, Rocchetti and Cavazza, participating in the Fascist Party, are convinced that the movement and the leader Mussolini can guarantee a period of peace, growth and stability in an Italy torn destruction of the bombs. Unfortunately the joys of the two friends soon vanish, as Mussolini proves to be a tyrant, who performs after the March on Rome. When Rocchetti try to rebel and autolicenziarsi from the party, is beaten to death. Fortunately Gavazza save him, and run away with the friend. However the March on Rome is made, and the two friends can not help but watch in silence the political change.
