While in Egypt, the three meet archaeologist Tom Baxter. Tom is brought back for a "madcap Manhattan weekend" where he falls head-over-heels for Kitty Haynes, a chanteuse at the Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana. 

After Cecilia sits through the film several times, Tom, noticing her, breaks the fourth wall, and emerges from the black-and-white screen into the colorful real world on the other side of the cinemas screen. He tells Cecilia that he is attracted to her after noticing her watching him so many times, and she takes him around her New Jersey town. Later, he takes her into the film and they have a great evening on the town  within the film. The two fall in love. But the characters defection from the film has caused some problems. In other copies of the film, others have tried to exit the screen.

This sets up an unusual love triangle involving Tom, Gil, and Cecilia. Cecilia must choose between them and she decides to choose the real person of Gil rather than the fantasy figure of Tom.

Michael Keaton was originally cast as Tom Baxter/Gil Shepherd, as Allen was a fan of his work. Allen later felt that Keaton, who took a pay cut to work with the director, was too contemporary and hard to accept in the period role. The two amicably parted ways after ten days of filming and Daniels replaced Keaton in the role. 

==Production== Bertrand Island Amusement Park, which closed just prior to the films production. It was also filmed at the Raritan Diner in South Amboy, New Jersey. Woody Allen shut down the Kent Theater on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn to film The Purple Rose of Cairo there. This is the movie theater in the neighborhood he grew up in and undoubtedly spent many hours there as a child and teenager.

==Woody Allens opinion==
In a rare public appearance at the National Film Theatre in 2001, Woody Allen listed The Purple Rose of Cairo as one of only a few of his films that ended up being "fairly close to what I wanted to do" when he set out to write it.  Allen provided more detail about the films origins in a comment he made a year earlier, during a press junket for Small Time Crooks:

:
Many of the outside scenes were filmed in Piermont, NY, a tiny village on the Hudson River about 15 miles north of the George Washington Bridge. Store fronts had false facades reflecting the depression-era setting.

===Critical response===
The Purple Rose of Cairo received much critical acclaim upon release, and currently holds a fresh 90% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.8/10. 
 Time Out also gave the film favorable appraisal, opining "As the star-struck couple, Farrow and Daniels work wonders with fantastic emotions, while Allens direction invests enough care, wit and warmth to make it genuinely moving."   Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote the film some of its most glowing praise, saying "My admiration for Mr. Allen extends to everyone connected with The Purple Rose of Cairo - all of the actors, including Mr. Daniels, Mr. Aiello, Dianne Wiest and the players within the film within; Stuart Wurtzel, the production designer, and particularly Gordon Willis, the director of photography, who has great fun imitating the look of the movie Cecilia falls in love with, as well as in creating a style fitting to the depressed times that frame the interior film."  Canby concluded, stating "Ill go out on a limb: I cant believe the year will bring forth anything to equal The Purple Rose of Cairo. At 84 minutes, its short but nearly every one of those minutes is blissful." 

===Accolades=== FIPRESCI Prize at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.
