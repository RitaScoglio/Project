== Outline ==
Superficially, it is a documentary about an ordinary man who—like many Japanese every year—disappears without trace, leaving his job and fiancee behind. Imamura though, takes the narrative in unexpected directions, causing the viewer to question what is reality and what might be fiction.

A Region 0 DVD release in the Masters of Cinema series was issued in October 2011.
