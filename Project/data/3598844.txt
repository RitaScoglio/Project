==Plot== anarchist being extradited and facing a death sentence for killing a high-ranking politician, and his guard, Crimp (John Carradine), who expects a $5,000 reward for delivering him. Pilot Bill Brooks (Chester Morris), co-pilot Joe (Kent Taylor), and steward Larry (Dick Hogan) comprise the crew.

On their way to Panama, a fierce nighttime storm buffets their airliner, The Silver Queen. A gas cylinder comes loose and is thrown against the door, forcing it open; Larry falls out to his death. An engine fails and the pilots are forced to crash-land in the jungle. In the morning, the professor recognizes plants of the Amazon rainforest: the aircraft has been blown far south of where rescuers would search, and the nearest civilization is across the mountains. But there is water where they are, and enough fruit and game to live on.

Weeks go by while Bill and Joe struggle to repair the damaged aircraft, and the others clear a runway. The experience changes everyone. The Spenglers rediscover their love for each other. Bill warms to an appreciative Peggy, although she tells him about her past. Judson goes to pieces, staying drunk much of the time, while Alice toughens up, and begins to feel attracted to Joe. The biggest change is in Vasquez. Seeing how well most of the group have coped with their situation, he reconsiders his radical beliefs.
 poison dart in it. Pete orders Peggy to take Tommy to safety while he covers their retreat, and is also killed by the unseen natives.

The remaining survivors board the now-repaired aircraft, but as the engines rev up, an oil leak develops. Bill and Joe patch it, but realize that it will fail some time after takeoff, leaving only one working engine. As a result, the aircraft can only carry four adults and Tommy across the mountains. As everyone tries to decide how to choose who must stay and face the hostile natives, Vasquez suddenly grabs a gun and announces that, since he is doomed no matter what, he is the only one without bias and will make the decision. While repairs are being made, he is approached by Professor Spengler, who says he and his wife have lived their lives and should stay, and by Judson, who tries to bribe Vasquez by offering to pay for a top lawyer.

When the aircraft is ready, Vasquez announces that both pilots and both of the younger women will go along with Tommy.  Judson attacks, and Vasquez shoots him dead.  The aircraft takes off, leaving Vasquez and the Spenglers. As the natives approach, Professor Spengler quietly informs Vasquez that they must not be taken alive, as they will be tortured. Vasquez lies to him, telling him that there are three bullets left. He kills the couple with his last two bullets, and waits for his grisly fate.

==Production==
 

Although primarily shot in a backlot, Five Came Back  overcame some of the limitations of the low-budget film. The fiery director insisted on a realistic jungle environment, and had trees imported to flesh out the landscape of the sound stage. Complicated by unwanted attention from the lead actor,  the clashes between Farrow and a contract player, Lucille Ball,  made for a tense set; when two Black Widow spiders dropped out of a tree onto Balls head, she was extremely upset and left the set, screaming. Brady 2001, p. 88.  
 El Cerrito in 1930 (a modified application for patent of the design with a half-span dorsal wing and two more engines appears in 1932).
 Flying Tigers, starring John Wayne, and others) before reportedly being scrapped. Flying shots in films were of a model; the aircraft itself was grounded by the studios insurance company. 

Principal photography was completed on April 26, 1939, coming in at an estimated $225,000. De la Hoz 2007, p. 189. 

==Reception== Frank Nugent praised Five Came Back as "a rousing salute to melodrama, suspenseful as a slow-burning fuse, exciting as a pinwheel, spectacularly explosive as an aerial bomb." 

Richard B. Jewell, Professor of American Film at the University of Southern California, wrote in The RKO Story, "In 1939, John Farrow directed one of the most exciting B films in company history. Since the title indicated how many would make it out alive, audience members were kept on the edge of their seats." Jewell describes the film as "one of the very best program melodramas in RKO history."
  
Five Came Back was also notable for lively "street smart" dialogue attributed to its team of distinguished screenwriters. Both Cady and West were later to be nominated for Academy Awards in future projects while Trumbo became one of Hollywoods most acclaimed screenwriters with two Oscars to his credit. 

Even though the studio had planned it as a standard "B" movie, Five Came Back became a surprise hit that "quickly amassed an enthusiastic word-of-mouth campaign among moviegoers." Stafford, Jeff.   Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: July 30, 2012.  The film, which cost $225,000 to make, eventually earned $262,000 in profits and collected substantial critical praise."
