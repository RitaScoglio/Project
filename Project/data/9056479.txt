==Plot== Tom is William Tell (he even throws one between his legs while blindfolded), a telegram arrives. Though it is meant for his owner, Tom reads it himself (it says, "Madam...In accord with the wishes of your eccentric Aunt Harriet your cat Thomas has been left the sum of one million dollars"). Tom initially shrugs this off but quickly realises that this is something that makes him very happy. Jerry also reads the letter and gets just as happy as Tom which confuses him. Tom quickly learns why after reading the telegram again, because the telegram also states that "terms of will specify that all benefits cease immediately should the cat bring harm to any living thing...EVEN A MOUSE".
 Park Ave!") dickey in his face, assaulting him in his limousine, eating his sundae, and even throwing him out of bed whilst still asleep.

The next morning, after Jerry steals his bathroom towel, Tom decides to get rid of Jerry. After a few ideas, he eventually decides on hanging a FIRE EXIT sign on the window. He strikes a match to start a fire in front of the bathroom door, and Jerry promptly jumps out the window. The cat cheers before sitting down to enjoy his breakfast, but when he grabs his napkin, however, he uncovers Jerry, who posts the telegram on the table and eats Toms breakfast. As a final insult, he attacks Tom yet again with the rest of the breakfast material, reminding him that as long as the "EVEN A MOUSE" rule stands, he can do anything and also slaps Toms dickey in his face. This proves to be the final straw: Tom loses his temper, and the shocked Jerry realizes that he has pushed Tom too far. Tom furiously grabs the telegram, tears it into pieces, and even shoves the "EVEN A MOUSE" proviso into Jerrys mouth. Jerry swallows it in horror at what is about to happen, as Tom leaps into the air with a frightening and insane scream before attacking Jerry with the crockery and broken breakfast tray. After a few seconds, he reflects on what he is about to do but realizes he is better off doing what he enjoys ("Gee, Im throwing away a million dollars. BUT IM HAPPY!"), then goes back to attacking Jerry.
