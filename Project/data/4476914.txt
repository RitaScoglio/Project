==Plot==
  
Walter Sparrow is an animal control officer married to Agatha with a son named Robin. At a bookstore, Agatha gives Walter a book called the number 23 as a birthday present.

Walter starts reading the book, noticing odd similarities between himself and the main character, a detective who refers to himself as "Fingerling (character)|Fingerling". Walter begins to have dreams of murdering Agatha. After one such dream, he checks into a hotel, in the room number 23, where he stays up all night finishing the book, only to discover that it ends at chapter 22 with Fingerling about to commit suicide after murdering his lover.

The next day, Walter sees a dog which he had earlier tried to capture that leads him to a cemetery and the grave of Laura Tollins, a college student who had been murdered by her professor Kyle Flinch, with whom she was having an affair. The circumstances of Lauras murder mirror those of Fingerlings lover in the book. Walter thinks the professor wrote the book as a secret confession and goes to see him in jail. The man proclaims his innocence of the murder and of being the author, stating he would never choose a pen name like "Topsy Kretts," pointing out that it is an obvious homophone for "Top Secrets."

Upon discovering an address in the book, the family arranges a meeting with Topsy Kretts, who, upon being confronted by Walter, becomes panicked, proclaims that Walter should be dead, and kills himself. Agatha finds an ID card belonging to a mental institution, showing the man is Dr. Sirius Leary. She goes to the abandoned asylum and finds Walters name on a box in Learys office. Meanwhile, Robin and Walter discover that every 23rd word on every twenty-third page of the book spells out two messages which lead them to "Casanovas Park." At the park they discover a human skeleton, presumably Tollins, but when they return with a police officer the bones have disappeared. Walter confronts Agatha about taking the bones and accuses her of writing the book. She admits to moving the skeleton to protect him, but tells Walter that it was he who wrote the book, and shows him the contents of the box from the Institute. In the box there is a manuscript of The Number 23 with Walters name on it and an ankle bracelet that belonged to Tollins. 

Walter returns to the hotel to room 23, where he finds the missing 23rd chapter written all over the wall. The chapter explains that the story was Walters confession and he remembers why he did everything: his father killed himself after the death of Walters mother. His suicide note was just pages of things that added up to the number 23. Walter loved Laura Tollins and grew obsessed with 23 because of his father. Laura began sleeping with her professor. Walter tried to warn her about the number being dangerous and how it was going to come after her. She didnt believe him, which led Walter to kill her, which the dog witnessed. The professor was the first to walk into the room where Laura was killed, and he picked up the knife, covering the weapon with his fingerprints making him get convicted for the murder. Walter went to the hotel room, wrote The Number 23, and attempted suicide. He survived but suffered severe injuries and trauma. Walter ended up in the institute where Dr. Leary worked. Dr. Leary read the manuscript and, after publishing it, became obsessed with the number 23 himself. Because of the fall, Walter suffered memory loss and upon leaving the institute he met Agatha.

Agatha finds Walter at the hotel, and tries to assure him that he is no longer the person he was when he wrote the book. He insists that he is a killer, accepting the fact that he murdered Tollins. He leaves the hotel and runs into the street to be run over by a bus but steps out of the way at the last minute when he realizes his son is watching. Walter turns himself in to the police and is awaiting sentencing, having been told that the judge will likely go easy on him since he turned himself in. A funeral procession takes place in front of Tollins grave, where it is implied her body has finally been laid to rest.

At the end of the film, viewers can see the Bible reading from  : "Be sure your sin will find you out."
