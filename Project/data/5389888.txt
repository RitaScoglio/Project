==Plot summary==

Devdhar (Rishi Kapoor) is a poor orphan who in his childhood had a magnetic friendship with Manorama (Padmini Kolhapure), the only daughter of the rich and powerful Thakur. The benevolent Thakur helped Devdhar go to the city for higher studies. After eight years, Devdhar returns to his village, where he finds Manorama has grown up. After seeing her again, Devdhar falls in love. Due to family status difference, he is unable to express his love for her. 

A chain of events leads to Manorama being married to a rich and handsome Thakur; her husband dies the day after the marriage and she becomes a widow. After her elder brother-in-law attempts to rape her, she returns to her parental home. When Devdhar learns of the situation, he works to rebuild Manoramas life and bring a smile to her face.
