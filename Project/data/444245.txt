==Plot== flashbacks before ending with a version of Hoffas mysterious disappearance. Jimmy Hoffa and Bobby Ciaro are first seen impatiently waiting in the parking lot of a roadhouse diner in 1975. Others are late for a meeting. Asked if he wants to leave, Hoffa gives Ciaro a scornful glance. The first flashback to 1935 then occurs:

A young Hoffa approaches a parked truck, inside of which driver Ciaro is taking a nap. Hoffa pitches the benefits of joining the  , but is persuaded to drop it at gunpoint by Hoffas associate Billy Flynn. Ciaro joins the pair in the arson bombing of a laundry whose owner has refused to cooperate with the Teamsters. Flynn is badly burned and dies. Ciaro succeeds him as Hoffas right-hand man.

Another flashback shows a Teamsters strike. While strikers fight with non-union workers and police, Hoffa is taken to a local Mafia boss. Ciaro, who speaks Italian language|Italian, comes along. An alliance between the Teamsters and the mob is formed. Hoffa meets Carol ("Dally") DAllesandro, who would become his closest mob ally.
 Attorney General. 

Hoffa is betrayed by a junior associate, Peter Connelly, in court. The evidence used against him are the plans he wrote on the back of a hunting license. He surrenders to federal officials and serves time in a Pennsylvania federal prison while Connellys uncle, Frank Fitzsimmons, takes over as Teamsters boss. Ciaro, also convicted and imprisoned, is freed before Hoffa and immediately begins working for his bosss release. DAllesandro suggests that the Teamsters endorse Richard M. Nixon for President, the idea being that in exchange for Teamster endorsement, Hoffa will receive a presidential pardon.

Hoffa gets out and expects to again run the Teamsters, but learns that one of the conditions of his release is that he is ineligible to run the union for ten years. Hoffa meets with DAllesandro and is shown screaming at the gangster, wanting Fitzsimmons killed.. DAllesandro believes that Hoffa is "too hot" and says, "I cant get close to it." Hoffa leaves with the matter unresolved.

Some time later, Ciaro delivers a message to DAllesandro that unless the matter of Fitzsimmons can be settled (the implication being that Hoffa wants Fitzsimmons either removed from office or killed), Hoffa will go to the press. DAllesandro says to tell Hoffa that "everythings gonna be all right" and also that Ciaro should tell Hoffa that they should all meet the next day at "the roadhouse," a remote diner.

Hoffa and Ciaro spend several hours waiting in the parking lot but DAllesandro never arrives. A purported union driver has been waiting for hours in the diner, allegedly for a part for his truck, engaging Ciaro in conversation. He is invited to meet Hoffa in person by bringing a cup of coffee to the car. The driver reveals himself to be a hit man as he draws a gun.

Hoffa is shot in the back seat and Ciaro is gunned down while running to Hoffas aid. Ciaros body is dumped on top of Hoffas and the car is driven into the back of a large truck that had driven up as the shootings were taking place. The camera focuses on the roll-up door of the truck showing the different state plates, implying a final bit of irony: that Hoffas dead body is being transported, in all likelihood, by a Teamster driver. The truck drives off into the sunset.
