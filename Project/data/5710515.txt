==Plot==
The story is about a horror movie actress named Raven Quinn (Debbie Rochon). After her marriage crumbles down, she wins the custody of her daughters and raises them alone. She feels fortunate that she finds a good neighbor named Wayne (Grant Kramer) who provides a much needed emotional support and agrees to baby sit her two young daughters.  
 
Little does Raven know, Wayne has his share of murders while growing up   and has now set his eyes to stalk her.  Wayne has an altar full of Ravens pictures   and a mannequin resembling Raven in his house.

As the movie progresses, Wayne feels cheated that Ravens co-workers are sharing her attention. Feeling jealous, Wayne murders Ravens co-stars one by one while dressed in a Santa Claus costume.   His weapon of choice is a "claw".
