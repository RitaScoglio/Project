== Background ==
 Little Prince Count Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (1900–1944). It is a poetic tale self-illustrated in watercolours in which a pilot stranded in the desert meets a young prince fallen to Earth from a tiny asteroid. The story is philosophical and includes societal criticism, remarking on the strangeness of the adult world.

Though ostensibly a childrens literature|childrens book, The Little Prince makes several profound and idealistic observations about life and human nature. For example, Saint-Exupéry tells of a fox meeting the young prince during his travels on Earth. The storys essence is contained in the lines uttered by the fox to the little prince: On ne voit bien quavec le cœur. Lessentiel est invisible pour les yeux. ("One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye.") Galembert, Laurent de Bodin de (2000)   , Université Paris IV, 29 Juin 2000, p.13.    Other key thematic messages are articulated by The Fox, such as: "You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed" and "It is the time you have devoted to your rose that makes your rose so important." The Foxs messages are arguably the most famous because of their nature of dealing with relationships.

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote and illustrated The Little Prince in New York City and Asharoken, N.Y. in mid-to-late 1942 while exiled in the United States after the  s, Theatre|stage, ballet, and operatic works.
 Countess Consuelo de Saint Exupéry.

The production is notable chiefly in that it marked the third last collaboration of composer Frederick Loewe and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner, and was their final musical. The musics creative team were dissatisfied with the films Hollywood treatment, with Loewe refusing to visit London to supervise the arrangement and recording of the score.

The film became one of the creative teams last collaborations—they would later reunite to write extra songs for a stage version of Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi.

== Plot ==
 book of aviator (played by Richard Kiley) forced to make an emergency landing in the Sahara Desert. There he is befriended by a young boy, the Little Prince, who had descended to Earth from Asteroid B-612. In the days that follow, The Pilot hears about his past and various journeys throughout the solar system.

As he travels through space, the Little Prince encounters several strange grown-ups on different planetoids, all with a skewed or curious way of looking at life. But it is not until he finally reaches Earth, that the Little Prince learns his most important life lessons of all, mainly from The Fox (Gene Wilder), and The Snake (Bob Fosse). Before the Little Prince dies, he shares those lessons with The Pilot.
