===From the Files of Police Squad! (1988)===
  Queen Elizabeth II, who is on a state visit to the USA. The main suspect is Vincent Ludwig, a rich businessman (Ricardo Montalbán), who uses a hypnotic device to turn others into murderers. As with previous ZAZ spoof comedies, the plot was mostly culled from another—more serious—movie. In this case, it was Telefon (film)|Telefon wherein people were triggered into assassins via hypnotic phone calls (indeed, dialogue in the post-hypnotic suggestion demonstration scene is copied word-for-word from Telefon).

On the case, Drebin falls in love with Ludwigs assistant, Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley). She knows nothing about Ludwigs plot, and after the pair spend the night together, Jane helps with Franks investigation.

===The Smell of Fear (1991)===
 
Frank discovers that Janes new boyfriend, Quentin Hapsburg (Robert Goulet), is involved in an evil plan to kidnap Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer (Richard Griffiths), a scientist whom President George H. W. Bush (John Roarke) has chosen to determine a new national energy policy. Hapsburg plans to kidnap the real Dr. Meinheimer and replace him with a lookalike named Earl Hacker (also portrayed by Griffiths) who will endorse an energy policy according to the dictates of the energy lobby.

===The Final Insult (1994)===
  moll (Anna Nicole Smith). The gang plots to blow up the Academy Awards. When Jane arrives looking for Frank, she is taken hostage.

===Unproduced Naked Gun 4 film===
 
A fourth film was first mooted while Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult was still in production. In a 1992 interview, the Zuckers said they were determined to follow up with a fourth film called Naked Gun 4: This Is Really It.  Leslie Nielsen suggested the title of Naked Gun 4: The Second Final Insult, "because then everybody will be asking what the first final insult was."   

In 2003, David Zucker said of a making another Naked Gun film that "We would really like to. The studio just doesnt get the joke though. They’re not interested in the franchise." 

In a 2007 radio interview, "Weird Al" Yankovic, who had cameos in all three Naked Gun films, confirmed that he had been approached about appearing in a fourth. 
 Paramount Famous Productions label. 

In 2009, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that 25 films and television series had qualified for production tax credits, including Naked Gun 4.  

In a May 2010 interview, Nielsen said he had heard about plans for a fourth film but was "not yet involved". 

Naked Gun 4: Rhythm of Evil was reported to be in the early stages of production at the time of Nielsens death in November 2010. 

Paramount has since attempted to develop a fourth installment of Naked Gun without Leslie Nielsen.  The aim was for a straight-to-video release, but the script was so well received it briefly shifted to the theatrical division before getting stalled over budgeting.  Alan Spencer reportedly wrote a treatment for the film.

==Reboot== Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant will write. 
However a month later Garant stated the film will be more of a sequel than reboot.

==Cast of characters==

===Main characters=== Sergeant Frank Drebin, Detective Sergeant Lieutenant Police Squad. He is the protagonist of all three films and the former TV series Police Squad!. In the first film, he meets Jane Spencer and they fall in love; in the second film, they resume their romance; in the third film, they are married, and Frank is retired from the force. Frank is a very successful police officer, who seems to solve all crimes by accident, many times causing mayhem  and havoc in the process, usually not noticing at all.
* Priscilla Presley as Jane Spencer (Jane Drebin in the third film). In the first film she is Vincent Ludwigs assistant, but knows nothing about his world domination plans. After she spends the night together with Frank, she helps him with his investigation. In the second film, her relationship with Frank is revealed to be over. She has a new boyfriend, Quentin Hapsburg. This is the second time she falls for a man with evil plans. She and Frank make up during the end of the second film. In the third film (in which she is married to Frank, who is retired from the force) the audience learns that she is now a lawyer. At the end of the third film, Jane gives birth to a son, who ironically looks like Nordberg, leading Frank to believe the two had an affair and chases after his colleague. However unbeknownst to him, Ed is escorting Jane to her room, holding her and Franks real baby.
* O. J. Simpson (Peter Lupus, TV series) as Officer Nordberg, one of Franks colleagues. He and Frank are partners for about five years, and he is Franks best friend as stated in the first film. Nordberg always gets himself in very painful situations in all of the films. He finds himself being chased after by a resentful and enraged Frank when he believes that Nordberg had an affair with Jane.
* George Kennedy (Alan North, TV series) as Captain Ed Hocken, Franks boss. Ed encourages Frank to talk to Jane in the second movie. It is revealed in the first film that he is married to a woman named Ethel, although in the second film he is married to a woman named Edna (and it is stated that he has been for 30 years).
*  , and Al are the only characters who each appeared in both Police Squad! and the Naked Gun films portrayed by the same actor. In the films, Hocken was portrayed by George Kennedy, and Nordberg by O.J. Simpson, Johnny and Lincoln both did not return in the films and Al only appeared in the first film.  Ronald "Tiny Ron" Taylor as Al, a very tall colleague of Frank, whose head is always out of frame. Al was a recurring character on Police Squad! but only made a cameo in the first film.
