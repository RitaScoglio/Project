==Plot==
It features Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson as the (unnamed) proprietors of an escort agency, Dreamytime Escorts. Mayalls character is devious, low-minded, calculating and stupid; Edmondsons merely very stupid.

Unusually, rather than providing businessmen with female companionship, the activities of their escort agency essentially involve the pair swooping on unsuspecting foreigners who call them, and forcing them to take part in a drinking binge at their expense. The two are alcohol-obsessed; when their home-brewed beer (which takes all of two days to brew and has a head made from washing-up liquid) isnt available, they steal from the delivery lorries pulling up at the off-licence downstairs: Edmondsons character dives out of the window into a large builders bucket and is hauled back up with the stolen exploding tonic water by Mayall.
 psychopathic contract Tom Jones tunes from the 1960s to drown their cries.
 protection money Peter Richardson whose abiding love is his CitroÃ«n DS car.

Mayall and Edmonson intercept a request intended for Mr. Jolly to "take out" the radio presenter and game show host Nicholas Parsons, who appears as himself. Parsons is due to open Hendersons off-licence, and Lovebucket wants to put a stop to it. Misinterpreting the request, they spend an evening with Parsons, who stays in their company because he believes them to be competition winners, the real ones having been pushed off the road by the Dreamytime Escorts van in an earlier scene. The two are confronted the following morning by Lovebucket, who wants to know what theyve done with the money provided with the contract (they have, of course, used to buy one thousand five hundred seventy four gin and tonics). Lovebucket insists that they complete the contract.

The two return to Parsonss house armed with a gun, chainsaw and grenades but fail to kill him as he leaves via helicopter to the off-licence to open it. They then chase after the helicopter with Lovebucket and his gang pursuing them and ends up crashing their van into a skip. Parsons reaches the off-licence but cant find Henderson so he goes upstairs and meets Mr. Jolly and is killed by him.

Mayall and Edmonson got into their office and start packing their suitcases to go and live in Rio but seen into Jollys office and watch him talking to Lovebucket. Some of the gang members go into their office only to find it empty as the two escaped through the window and go into the off-licence where they are told by Henderson that Parsons is opening it much to their excitement. Shortly after Henderson overhears the two talking about killing Parsons causing Mayall to shoot him dead, but tricks Edmonson into thinking he did it. Edmonson decides to have a drink  but ends up taking a bottle of explosive tonic water from one of the shelves causing an explosion in the off-licence. 

But it is revealed during the credits that the two survived and are walking along a canal where Mayall knocks Edmonson into it before walking off with Edmonson swimming after him.
