}} David Hare in 1997.
 radio play, both of which featured Wallace Shawn as Jack, Deborah Eisenberg as Judy, and Larry Pine as Howard.

==Plot synopsis== fascist tendencies, communist guerrilla guerrilla movement lower class, is imprisoning and executing anyone suspected of subversion, including writers and intellectuals who have no direct connection to the guerrillas.

One of the latter is Howard, a respected poet who wrote political essays in his youth; his daughter Judy and her husband Jack are also at risk of becoming suspects by association. Jack, an embittered English professor, is the plays chief narrator. He is generally uninterested in politics, but is somewhat sympathetic toward the governments murderous acts, for two reasons: he secretly resents Howard as a representative of "highbrow" culture, and he fears that his middle class|middle-class world would be wiped out if the rebels succeeded. As political repression worsens, Jack withdraws from his family and from reality. Howard is killed due to an arbitrary decision by the government, Judy is arrested and subsequently executed for unclear reasons, and Jack, after recovering from his nervous breakdown, is left as the sole survivor of Howards literary circle.

There is no visible action in the play or the film; the three characters describe their memories in separate fragments of monologue (as in Samuel Becketts Play (play)|Play), with brief scenes of dialogue between them.

Though the play is generally more realistic than Shawns previous politically charged work The Fever, it focuses on the characters emotional lives and leaves the civil war in the background. As a result, many reviewers of the play and film have been unclear as to whether the assassinated characters were killed by the government, for sympathizing with the rebels, or (as Jack fears) by the rebels, for being privileged academics. A close reading of the play suggests that the rebels (if they even exist) have not gained power and that what has occurred is a purge by one faction of the regime.

* Roger Ebert review of the film   "To see this film (directed by David Hare while his stage production was being performed in London with the same actors) is not the best choice. The material suffers by being placed in a frame it is not suited to. Its likely that an audio book of the play or film will be released, and that would be a good way to absorb Shawns disturbing, introspective, Prufrockian words."
