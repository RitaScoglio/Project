Wild Things (also known as Sex Crimes) is a 1998 American erotic thriller film starring Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Kevin Bacon, Denise Richards and Theresa Russell. It was directed by John McNaughton.

An "uncut" version, adding seven minutes to its runtime, was released on DVD in 2004 and includes a change to Kelly and Suzies relationship. The film gained notoriety for featuring several sex scenes – in particular, one involving a man and two women simultaneously – that were more explicit than is typically seen in mainstream, big-budget Hollywood releases. It spawned several Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD sequels that were released in 2004, 2005 and 2010.

==Plot==
A  ). Kellys mother is humiliated by the scandal, and Lombardo and Bowden negotiate an $8.5 million settlement for defamation. In reality, however, Lombardo and the two girls were accomplices who used the trial as a way to get money from Kellys wealthy family. To celebrate their success, the three of them have sex.

Police detective Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) tells both Kelly and Suzie that Lombardo transferred the money to an off-shore account. Suzie panics and goes to Kelly for help. Kelly assures Suzie that they can trust each other, but separately tells Lombardo over the phone that they may have to get rid of her. Suzie overhears this and attacks Kelly in the pool. Both girls fight, but eventually end up having sex in the pool, all witnessed by Duquette. However, a few nights later, Lombardo and Kelly take Suzie to the beach and seemingly kill her. After wrapping the body in plastic, they throw it in the trunk of the car and drive out to the swamp, where Lombardo disposes of it. 

Duquette and his partner, Gloria (Daphne Rubin Vega), are called in to investigate Suzies disappearance. Her blood and teeth are later found on the beach while her car is found at a bus terminal. Duquettes superior insists that he drop the case, but Duquette goes to Kellys house to confront her. When he arrives, Kelly appears to attack him, shooting him in the arm. Duquette is left with no choice but to kill her in self-defense. No charges are filed against Duquette, but he is dismissed from the force and loses his pension.

Later, it is revealed that Lombardo and Duquette had been working together the entire time. Although Lombardo is not pleased that Duquette killed Kelly instead of framing her as originally planned, Duquette insists that it leaves fewer loose ends. The two agree to go fishing on Lombardos sailboat the following day. Once they are at sea, Lombardo knocks Duquette overboard. When Duquette climbs back aboard and attacks Lombardo, he is shot in the leg with a spear by the still-living Suzie. She shoots and kills Duquette as revenge for killing her friend, Davie, years before. Suzie then poisons Lombardo with a drink she pours for him and knocks him overboard, leaving him to die.

An ending sequence features a number of quick scenes that fill in details of the backstory, featuring how the conspirators plotted with and manipulated one-another. These scenes it is revealed that Suzie was the ultimate architect of the entire plot, orchestrating it to gain control of all of the settlement money herself and take revenge on both Lombardo and Duquette: Lombardo for leaving her in jail and Duquette for killing Davie. Suzie had discovered that Lombardo and Kelly were sleeping together, and used it to her advantage. As for Kellys death, she had not attacked Duquette as he had claimed. In reality, when she tried to escape the guest house when he entered, he punched her to incapacitate her, then broke into the gun case, and shot her twice with his gun. He then used her hand to shoot himself in the shoulder. In a final scene Bowden meets with Suzie, whose financial affairs he is handling. She kisses him on the cheek and as she walks off, Bowden tells her to "be good".
