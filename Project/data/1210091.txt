}} Universal Pictures on August 5, 1994. The film is an adaptation of Hal Roachs Our Gang, a series of short films of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as The Little Rascals) which centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood children. The film, with a screenplay by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur, and Penelope Spheeris who also directed presents several of the Our Gang characters in an updated setting, and features re-interpretations of several of the original shorts. It was the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were Liar Liar and Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers.

A second Universal Little Rascals film, The Little Rascals Save the Day, was released as a direct-to-video feature in 2014.

==Plot==
In Summer of 1973 Spanky is the president of the "He-Man Woman (woman is misspelled as womun) Haters Club" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. His best friend, Alfalfa, has been chosen as the driver for the clubs prize-winning undefeated go-kart, "The Blur", in the annual Soap Box Derby style race. However, when the announcement is made, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found.

The boys catch Alfalfa in the company of Darla. The clubs members try their hardest to break the two apart, eventually causing their beloved clubhouse to burn down. Darla is mistakenly led to believe Alfalfa feels ashamed of her, so she turns her attentions to Waldo, the new kid whose father (played by Donald Trump) is an oil tycoon. Spanky, Stymie and friends judge Alfalfas punishment to be left guarding the go-kart day and night until the day of the race. Until that day comes, Alfalfa makes many attempts to woo back Darla including a visit to her ballet rehearsal, an undelivered love letter, and through serenade.

In order to rebuild their clubhouse, the boys try to fund-raise the cost of lumber, $450. But the youngest ones, Porky and Buckwheat, have unknowingly come up with $500. Their school teacher finds out about the scheme, but Spanky convinces her to use the funds as prize money for the go-kart derby.

"The Blur" is stolen by local bullies Butch and Woim. In addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys now need a new set of wheels. They band together to build "Blur 2: The Sequel." Prior to race day, Spanky and Alfalfa reconcile and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, to be presented to the victors by the greatest racer of all, "A.J. Ferguson."

Butch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo, who (seemingly) kicks out Darla from his race car, pulls a few tricks of his own. Its a wild race to the finish, but "Blur 2" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack (and resulting in a photo-finish between "The Blur, and "The Blur 2" literally "by a hair" due to Alfalfas pointy hairstyle.), despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the derby. When Butch and Woim try to beat up Alfalfa, he knocks Butch into pig slop and Woim throws himself into the pig slop.

Along with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darlas heart after it is revealed that Darla kicked Waldo out of the car, not the opposite. Spanky, meanwhile, is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson -- "a girl!" As soon as the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart toward membership and welcome Darla and friends to their club, with "Women Welcome" added to the sign.

==Repurposed scenes and situations==
Many of the gags and subplots in the film were borrowed from the original Our Gang/Little Rascals shorts. These include:
* The scene in which Buckwheat and Porky are fishing and get their fishing lines tangled originates from a scene in the 1943 Our Gang short Three Smart Guys with Billie Thomas|Buckwheat, Billy Laughlin|Froggy, and Robert Blake (actor)|Mickey.
* The He-Man Woman Haters Club originally appeared in the 1937 Our Gang short Hearts are Thumps; the club would return in the short Mail and Female the same year. The plots for both shorts were reused for the film. In addition, the scene where the gang ruins Alfalfa and Darlas lunch date, as well as the scene where bubbles come out of Alfalfas mouth while he sings, were borrowed gags from Hearts are Thumps. Alfalfa sending Buckwheat and Porky to deliver a love note to Darla was borrowed from Mail and Female.
* The "hi-sign" originally appeared in the 1935 Our Gang short Anniversary Trouble, and the animated 1979 special, The Little Rascals Christmas Special. Hook and Farina in The Fourth Alarm. Farina and Election Day. Stymie and Dickie Moore Spanky and Alfalfa tried pulling it off in both the 1935 short Teachers Beau and the 1936 short Two Too Young. Spanky and Alfalfa wore in Rushin Ballet. The gag in which Alfalfa gets a frog loose in his clothes was originally used in the 1937 short Framing Youth, where Spanky was trying to convince him he had a frog in his throat. 
* Alfalfa singing "The Barber of Seville" originated in Our Gang Follies of 1938.
* The idea of the children building their own vehicle out of junk and scrap metal had been used in several Our Gang shorts, most notably the 1934 short Hi-Neighbor!. The gag in which the kids car causes several adults to leap into the air was also borrowed from Hi-Neighbor!, and also appears in One Wild Ride (1925), Free Wheeling (1932), and Divot Diggers (1936).
* Much of the Go-Cart race climax (including the gag in which the car belonging to Butch and Woim accidentally goes into reverse) was borrowed from the 1939 short Auto Antics. Material from Hi-Neighbor and Three Men in a Tub (1938) is also present.
