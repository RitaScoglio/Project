}} Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. The film was the first Mickey Mouse film produced in color  and remains one of the most highly acclaimed of the Disney shorts. The story is about a small music band conducted by Mickey Mouse which struggles through a distraction-filled public performance.

The Band Concert was directed by Wilfred Jackson and featured adapted music by Leigh Harline. The only speaking character in the film is Donald Duck who is performed by voice actor Clarence Nash.  

==Plot==
Mickey Mouses orchestra is performing a concert at the park. As the film opens they are being applauded for having just played music from Zampa. They next begin Gioacchino Rossini|Rossinis William Tell Overture|William Tell overture. 

Mickey is first disturbed by Peter Pigs   appears rolling a vendor cart through the audience selling lemonade, popcorn, and ice cream. Donalds voice disturbs Mickey as he can be heard over the music.
 pull from thin air.

After Donald has been kicked off stage, a bee comes along and harasses him. Donald fights the bee off and it goes on to bother the already agitated Mickey. Mickeys swatting of the bee is taken as a cue from the orchestra. Donald later throws ice cream at the bee which hits Mickey, instead. As Mickey plays Ranz des Vaches, Horace Horsecollar tries to kill the bee with a hammer but hits Goofy on the head, driving his head down into his jacket, but he continues playing his clarinet from inside it.

Finally, the band comes to the "Storm" segment of the overture which seems to summon an actual tornado, prompting the audience, the seats, and Donald to run for their lives. The tornado sucks up everything in its path, even the pavilion on which the band is playing. But the band is so used to distractions by this point that they continue to play from inside the tornado (in which Mickey floats past the remains of a wrecked house). As the storm passes, the band (except Horace and Mickey) is thrown into a tree and the overture comes to its natural conclusion. Yet by this time the only remaining audience member is Donald Duck who applauds enthusiastically. He then produces one last flute and plays "Turkey in the Straw" again, but the band members throw their instruments at him in disgust.

==Reception==
Although The Band Concert did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it has nonetheless become one of the most highly acclaimed Disney short films. Esquire (magazine)|Esquire magazine cultural critic Gilbert Seldes wrote that "  dozens of works produced in America at the same time in all the other arts can stand comparison with this one." The Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini was such a fan of The Band Concert that he saw it six times in the theater and later invited Walt Disney to his home in Italy. 

In 1994 The Band Concert was rated third in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons, which rated the greatest cartoons of all time by members of the field of animation.  As a result, it was the highest ranked Disney cartoon on the list, and the only one in the top 5 not produced by Warner Bros.
