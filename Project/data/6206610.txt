==Production==
Lamond wanted to make a film in the vein of those directed by Just Jaeckin such as Emmanuelle:
 The French have always been able to make their films NOT be pornographic, they’d be erotic. They were classy – the most they could ever say was ‘softcore’. And the way they did it, they made pretty images that looked like a Singapore Airlines TV commercial, they had nice fashion, good photography and nice music. And that way it dresses it up and makes it all chocolate boxy... I thought okay, the way to do that on a film budget is to go somewhere exotic. Make sure the people are pretty and they don’t have pimples. Don’t be sordid in any way, have pretty music and exotic locations, nice lighting and nice fashion. So even though it was a tiny film, we came up to Hong Kong and we got all the clothes tailor made for them, so that they fitted properly.    George Miller was going to direct but he wanted to take the film in a different direction. 

Lamond secured investment from Roadshow Pictures, then tried to obtain funding from the government film bodies. They refused, although the AFC offered to loan him $40,000, but Lamond did not want to be beholden to them. He formed a unit trust and sold a hundred units at $1,250 each which people could buy in any number, and the movie was made entirely with private funds. Scott Murray, "John Lamond", Cinema Papers Oct/Nov 1978 p97-98 

Glory Annen was a Canadian actress living in London who was cast in the lead role.

The film was shot in 1977. The   style" as Emmanuelle, "No. 3 fog filers and so on. It gives the film a nice, respectable look. 

In one scene the characters go to a movie where   is being shown. Lamond describes this as a "pure Roger Corman-style economic necessity." 

==Box office==
Felicity grossed $532,000 at the box office in Australia,  which is equivalent to $2,080,120
in 2009 dollars. According to Lamond it also sold widely around the world. 
==Proposed Sequel==
Lamond intended to make a sequel, Felicity in the Garden of Pleasures. It was budgeted at $230,000 and the South Australian Film Corporation decided to invest A$100,000. The Corporations director, John Morris, told the board “the film would be funny, commercial and R-rated”. However the decision was much criticised and the SAFC withdrew their investment. No sequel was made.
