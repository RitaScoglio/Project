Stedman notes several errors in the production: The Tiger Woman costume is made from Leopard fur. When outside, the natives are dressed as Navaho but, when inside, they are dressed as Aztecs.  The chorus girl line, and their "harem-girl" costume, during an execution is frowned on.  The men in the serial do not remove their hats whether inside or out. {{cite book
