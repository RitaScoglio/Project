 Robert Preston.
 depression of the 1930s. She marries a wealthy Southern plantation owner (Robert Preston (actor)|Preston), is widowed suddenly, yet through it all, with the help of her dearest friend, Vera Charles (Bea Arthur|Arthur), manages to keep things under control.

==Plot==
At the reading of the will of young Patrick Denniss (Kirby Furlong) father, a trustee, Mr. Babcock (John McGiver), reveals that Patrick is to be left in the care of his aunt, Mame Dennis (Lucille Ball), as well as his nanny, Agnes Gooch (Jane Connell). The two take a train to New York City (Main Title Including St. Bridget). When they arrive at Mames home, they walk into a wild party that Mame is giving for a holiday she herself created (Its Today). Patrick asks if he may slide down her banister, then reveals his true identity. Mame introduces the boy to her friends, including renowned stage actress (and famous lush), Vera Charles (Beatrice Arthur).

The following morning, Patrick reveals to Mame that she is to be his guardian, and she decides that she wants to fill his life with adventure (Open a New Window). She enrolls him in "the School of Life," a very non-traditional school. But when Vera inadvertently leads the trustee, Babcock, to the school, Patrick is taken from Mames custody.  Simultaneously, Mame learns that the stock market crash has left her penniless. Vera offers her a very small role as The Man in the Moon in her newest operetta about a lady astronomer. Mame flubs her one line and causes the play to be a disaster, which puts a major rift in their friendship. Patrick, who was in the audience, reassures Mame that shes not a failure and that he still loves her (My Best Girl).
 Beauregard Stonewall Jackson George Pickett Ambrose Burnside (Robert Robert Preston), to whom she attempts to sell a pair of roller skates.  However, when she is unable to write up a cash order, she is fired.  Unable to remove the skates she has demonstrated, Mame roller skates home, dejected due to her inability to pay manservant Ito (George Chiang) or Agnes, who have promised to stay with her.  Mame decides to lift everyones spirits by decorating the house for Christmas and giving everyone their Christmas gifts (We Need a Little Christmas), which include Patricks first pair of long pants. Agnes and Ito surprise her with the news that the butcher bill has been paid.

Beau, whos been looking for Mame since she was fired, appears at her front door and invites everyone to dinner.  Beau is in love, and brings Mame and Patrick to his familys plantation in Peckerwood, Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia, where theyre immediately greeted by Sally Cato (Joyce Van Patten). However, a number of Beaus relatives, especially Mother Burnside (Lucille Benson) and Cousin Fan (Ruth McDevitt), are unhappy about Beau marrying a "Yankee."  Sally decides to invite Mame to a foxhunt. Despite not knowing a thing about riding a horse, Mame accepts. The following day, Mame accidentally captures the fox, despite not knowing what she was doing. All of Beaus family and friends (except for Sally) now sing her praises (Mame).

She and Beau go on an extended honeymoon, traveling all over the world (Loving You). While theyre away, Patrick goes from a young child who pulls in a B+ average to a high school senior (Bruce Davison) flunking many classes (The Letter). When Beau is accidentally killed in an avalanche in the Alps, Mame returns home to be reunited with a now-grown Patrick, who is dating a very snobby conservative girl named Gloria Upson (Doria Cook-Nelson).

When Mame meets Vera for a drink, the two trade snippy comments, which they insist are not being made out of hatred, but simple honesty, as thats what Bosom Buddies do. The two come home and reminisce about men theyve dated. Agnes, who is listening to the conversation, admits that shes never had a date. Mame and Vera decide to give the uptight, frumpy Agnes a makeover and send her out to live, because "Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death."   Six months later, Agnes returns home, visibly pregnant. Agnes then describes what she did while living it up (Goochs Song).

Mame visits the Upsons (Don Porter and Audrey Christie) at their home, Upson Downs in Connecticut. She learns for the first time that Patrick and Gloria are engaged. After spending several hours with the Upsons and finding them insufferable bores and bigots, Mame is asked to help pay for a piece of property next door to Upson Downs so that Patrick and Gloria could live there, as opposed to "the wrong kind of people."  Afterwords, she is candid with Patrick about her disdain for the family. He admits that hes ashamed of her and her "crazy" friends. A heartbroken Mame wonders what she did wrong with this boy she raised (If He Walked Into My Life).

Mame and Patrick apologize to each other off-screen and are dressed for company: the Upsons. Mame promises to behave, and Agnes is asked to remain in her room. Just before the Upsons arrival, Patrick talks to Mames new maid, Pegeen (Bobbi Jordan).  After arriving, Mr. and Mrs. Upson announce that the property theyd wanted had been bought by some "Jew lawyer".  Suddenly, Vera and several men barge into Mames house, singing Its Today (the reprise). Vera toasts the new couple, mistaking Pegeen for Gloria. At that moment, Agnes comes downstairs, and the Upsons discover she is going to be an unwed mother. At that moment, a large group of unwed pregnant women barge in, singing. (Open a New Window reprise) Mame reveals to the Upsons that she bought the property next door so she could build the Beauregarde Burnside Memorial Home For Single Mothers. This is the final straw, and the Upsons leave, angry that Mame isnt "one of them." Patrick, visibly upset, leaves the house.
 Pied Piper." Mame and Peter wave goodbye and go into the plane. The plane takes off, followed by clips of Mame embracing Vera, Agnes, Beau, adult Patrick, and young Patrick (Finale: Open a New Window/Mame).

==Production==
Filming, scheduled to begin in early 1972, was postponed when Ball broke her leg in a skiing accident. Owing to the delay, original director George Cukor was forced to withdraw from the project. The assignment went to Gene Saks, who had helmed the Broadway production.

Production began in January 1973. Ball, who had casting approval, was dissatisfied with Madeline Kahns interpretation of Gooch and had her replaced by Jane Connell, another member of the original Broadway cast. 
 Tony for Oscar nominee for The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|"The Manchurian Candidate", Gaslight (1944 film)|"Gaslight", and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|"The Picture of Dorian Gray". 

==Reception== New Republics Stanley Kauffman, though he pointed out that Ball would have made a perfect Mame had she played the role "fifteen years earlier," described her as "too old, too stringy in the legs, too basso in the voice, and too creaky in the joints." Virtually every critic took notice of the heavy-handedness in photographing Ball out of focus, Rex Reed going so far as to suggest, albeit jokingly, that chicken fat was put over the lens. Some regarded this as evidence that those executives responsible for signing Ball, and Ball herself, knew from the outset that she was too old for her role. In her defense in regards to her lack of singing ability, Ball told one interviewer "Mame stayed up all night and drank champagne! What did you expect her to sound like? Julie Andrews?" 
 Movie Guide, critic Leonard Maltin rated the film as "BOMB" and wrote: "Hopelessly out-of-date musical ... will embarrass even those who love Lucy. Calling Fred and Ethel Mertz!" 

Not all the reviews were bad.   first-night when, as a budding actress, she falls off a huge cardboard moon. I even treasure her prying loose the fingers of a sloshed   reported that the film is "why movies were invented" and added that "Lucille never looked lovelier."  , wrote (in the magazines March 1974 issue) a breathless paean to Lucille Ball and the film, concluding that "Mame is Lucille Ball and Lucille Ball is Mame."

The Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded Ball a Golden Globe nomination (Arthur received one as well) but, disheartened by its reception, she swore she never would appear on the big screen again, and the film proved to be her last theatrical film (not counting Stone Pillow, her 1985 made-for-TV film).

Beatrice Arthur later called her involvement with the film a "tremendous embarrassment" and expressed regret at having participated.  Although she enjoyed working with Lucille Ball, she made no secret of her opinion that Lucy was "terribly miscast". 

==Home media== AMC and TCM have been known to exist.

On June 19, 2007, Mame was officially released on DVD both separately and in a special DVD collection of Lucille Balls films.  The DVD includes a remastered version of the film in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital 1.0 mono sound, the original theatrical trailer, and the featurette Lucky Mame.

Although Warner had intended to give the film a 5.1 stereo remastering, they were unable to do so due to several factors. The main factor was the fact that Balls vocals in her songs often had to be pieced together line by line in order to get a more pitch-perfect performance (this method is a lot more obvious on the soundtrack CD, where you can often hear a difference in fidelity in each individual line as well as the occasional line that sounds like two Lucys singing.) This and the varying conditions of the original masters caused Warner Bros. to simply restore the original releases mono soundtrack and remaster it in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono and use it for the DVDs audio track.
