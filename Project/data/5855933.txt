==Reviews==
Idlebrain wrote:"Bhadra is an average formula film, which runs on the strengths of Ravi Teja".  Fullhyd wrote:"Bhadra is another version of the kind of chug-a-lug entertainment that made Idiot and Amma Nanna O Tamil Ammayi worthy of a mention in conversations that are going nowhere".  Sify wrote:"The basic problem of Bhadra is that it is a poor clone of Okkadu and there is hardly anything new in presentation and packaging".  Indiaglitz wrote:"The problem for Bhadra is tries to be masala film among masala films ---- it incorporates all the big elements".  Telugucinema wrote:"Bhadra more concentrates on lighter aspect in the first half and soon drifts into mundane faction drama in the second half. It is laced with cliched faction film formulae, Tata Sumo chases, killings and counter killings, flashback method, and gory".
