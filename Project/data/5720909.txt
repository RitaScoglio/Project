Primeval is a 2007 American horror film which was released on January 12, 2007. The film, starring Dominic Purcell, Brooke Langton, Orlando Jones and Jürgen Prochnow, depicts a team of American journalists who travel to Burundi to film and capture a gigantic, man-eating crocodile.

Primeval was inspired by the true story of Gustave (crocodile)|Gustave, a 1 ton, 20 foot (6 meter) giant, man-eating crocodile in Burundi. 

==Plot==
 
  British forensic UN soldiers accompanying her fire into the water, but only her partially devoured corpse floats to the surface.

In a New York City newsroom, television journalist Tim Manfrey (Purcell) is assigned by his boss, Roger (Patrick Lyster), to travel to Burundi with Aviva Masters (Langton), a reporter who deals with animal stories and has become interested in Gustave (crocodile)|Gustave, an enormous, fierce crocodile known to have killed hundreds of people in Africa. With the killing of the anthropologist, Roger says, Gustave is suddenly a story of interest to the world. Tim doesnt want to go, knowing that Burundi is a war zone, but he has little choice, since he is already in trouble after one of his stories turns out to have been based on falsified evidence. Tim and Aviva are accompanied to Burundi by Tims cameraman and friend, Steven Johnson (Jones) and herpetologist Matt Collins (Gideon Emery), who is intent on capturing Gustave alive.

At the airport in Bujumbura they are met by a government official nicknamed Harry (Dumisani Mbebe), who tries to delay their departure by warning them of unrest in the bush, caused by a dangerous warlord who has nicknamed himself "Little Gustave". Tim manages to overrule Harry by faking a call to Roger, and the team departs the next day, accompanied by two soldiers.

When the party reach the village where the last attack occurred, they meet their guide, a licensed hunter named Jacob (Prochnow), and are blessed by the local shaman. Aviva also notices a small dog tethered to a floating log in the river, with which the villagers are attempting to placate Gustave.  She rescues the dog and names it "Wiley E. Coyote|Wiley".

The friendly villagers assemble a steel cage in order to catch Gustave, and take it to a nearby swamp. The first attempt to capture Gustave fails, but Matt manages to shoot him with a tracking dart.

Steven, while wandering off to shoot some scenic footage, catches on film Little Gustave himself executing the shaman along with his family.

Jojo (Gabriel Malema), a teenage villager who helped set up the cage, tries to capture Gustave using himself as bait, in the hopes that the team will take him to America. Aviva catches one of their soldier escorts stealing money from a tent. The soldier knocks her down and is about to rape her, when Gustave arrives and kills him. The remaining guard relays over his radio that the Americans videotaped the shamans execution.

Just as the group realizes that the soldiers work for Little Gustave, the remaining guard shoots and wounds Jacob; just as he is about to execute the whole group, Jojo shoots him from behind with Jacobs elephant gun.

While Jacobs wound is being treated, Gustave attacks the group. Jacob recalls the story of how his wife, Ona, was killed by Gustave, and that he swore revenge. Jacob produces a grenade, and detonates it as Gustave grabs him in his jaws, and devours him, but the explosion fails to kill the crocodile.

The next day, a helicopter arrives to airlift the survivors, but a truck arrives with two of Little Gustaves men, who fire a rocket at the helicopter. The group ducks, except for Matt, who runs after the helicopter to stop it from flying away. Matt is rammed by the truck and shot to death by the younger of the two militias, a teenager performing what is clearly his first execution.

When the driver of the truck notices the rest of the group, Tim yells for them to split up. In the ensuing chase, both of Little Gustaves men are killed: when the truck crashes into the river, the teenager is thrown out and dies on impact, while the driver is shot by Aviva when he tries to strangle Tim to death.

Steven stumbles upon Gustave and struggles to escape. While Aviva stays with the injured Jojo, Tim goes to look for Steven, but finds only his camera. As they are waiting for help, Tim remarks to Aviva that he now understands the shamans earlier words that "we make our own monsters". Matt had earlier told the group that crocodiles frequently feed on carrion, and there is no limit to how large they can grow, given enough sustenance; it is the bodies from the civil war, floating in the river, that have given Gustave a taste for human flesh, and allowed him to reach such a gargantuan size.
 Range Rover, GPS tracker linked to the dart on Gustave, saying it will locate the computer with the video. Harry forces Tim and Aviva to lead them to the "computer".

While Harry holds Aviva at gunpoint, Tim and one of Harrys men follow the tracking signal to Gustaves lair, where the crocodile is sleeping. Tim finds Stevens mutilated body, and a combat knife in the scattered human remains, and stabs the guard. At the same moment, Aviva splatters Harry with Matts container of crocodile pheromones, and runs. Gustave wakes up and ignores Tim and Aviva in favor of devouring Harry.

Tim, Jojo and Aviva climb into the Range Rover, but Gustave attacks through the rear window. Tim stabs the crocodile in the mouth with a machete. It then, roars in defeat, as the others manage to escape.

Tim, Aviva, Jojo and Wiley receive medical treatment and fly home to America, watching leftover footage of Steven on his camera. The end credits state that the Burundian Civil War ended with a ceasefire in 2005, but Gustave is very much alive and still killing people, in the rivers of Burundi.

==Promotion==
Filming commenced in April 2006 in South Africa. Another crocodile horror film, Rogue (film)|Rogue, had to be pushed back until Fall 2007 because of the films similarities with Primeval.

The films promotional trailer dubs Gustave a "serial killer", who has claimed more than 300 victims and "remains at large". It is compared to Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer with his non-human status never mentioned except for a brief line where the narrator says, "Hes real, but hes not human". A shortened version of this trailer does not contain this at all. However, in the trailer, a crocodile, presumably Gustave, briefly flashes on screen. The promotional poster similarly calls Gustave "the most prolific serial killer in history". The films official website rarely makes any mention that the killer is in fact a crocodile.

==Reception==
The film was poorly received, gaining a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Naturalist Patrice Faye said Primeval "is an insult to purists and herpetologists but, above all, an insult to Burundi. It shows the country in a bad light, and the people of Burundi are made out to be savages, barbarians, thieves, and murderers".
