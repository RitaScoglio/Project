This film opens with a resurrection scene set shortly after the climax of Taste the Blood of Dracula, but is set in Draculas Transylvanian homeland rather than England, as that film was. The British Film group EMI took over distribution of the film after Warner Brothers and other American studios refused to distribute it in the U.S. It was also the first of several Hammer films to get an R rating.

==Storyline==
===Prologue=== 
In the opening scene, after the previous events (Taste the Blood of Dracula), Draculas remains, his cape, a scattered pile of red dust and dried blood are seen in the church altar following his destruction by Paul and Alice in the previous adventure. Suddenly, a large bat flies in and hovers over the altar. Blood drips from its fangs and onto the vampires remains. Almost immediately, the remains start to interact and bond with the dripped blood. Within seconds, Count Dracula is once more resurrected...

===Plot===
The scene switches to Draculas homeland (after a period of approximately a year), where the local villagers are enraged that yet another young woman has been murdered by the Count. With a priests blessing, they rise up and set fire to Castle Dracula. However, the Count is safely asleep in a solid stone crypt. When the villagers return home, they find that every single woman and child in the village has been slaughtered in the church by bats.

Falsely accused of rape by the spurned burgomasters daughter, libertine Paul Carlson flees the Kleinenberg authorities by jumping into a nearby coach which, though driverless, heads off at great speed. He is deposited near Count Draculas mountaintop castle. Initially he is welcomed by the Count and a beautiful woman named Tania who later reveals herself to be a prisoner of Dracula as his mistress. Paul later has a liaison with Tania who concludes their lovemaking by trying to bite his neck. Dracula enters and, casually throwing off Pauls efforts to stop him, savagely stabs Tania to death with a dagger for betraying him. The vampires servant Klove dismembers her body and dissolves the pieces in a bath of either holy water or acid. Trapped in a room high in the castle, Paul uses a line to climb down to a lower window but the line is withdrawn by Klove and he is trapped in a dark room with only door locked and a coffin at the center of the room.

Pauls more sober brother, Simon Carlson and Pauls fiancee Sarah Framsen, come searching for him. A maid at the tavern directs them to the castle and they investigate. Dracula has immediate designs on the lovely Sarah, but Klove, who has fallen in love with the young woman after seeing her photograph amongst Pauls possessions, helps the young couple escape by refusing to do Draculas bidding to remove Sarahs crucifix. The servant pays a terrible price for his disobedience, when he is sadistically burnt by Dracula with a red-hot cutlass.

Simon, having enlisted the help of the village priest, goes back to the castle to look for his brother. However, the priest is attacked by a large bat and killed and Simon is betrayed by Klove, ending up in the same locked room as his brother. Opening the coffin in the middle of the room, Simon discovers the sleeping Dracula, but the vampires power reaches through his closed eyelids causing the young man to collapse before he can take action against the Count.

When Simon recovers, the vampire has vanished. Investigating further into a second part of the room, Paul horrifically finds his brothers drained corpse on a spike. Looking out of the window, he is amazed to see the Count running up the far wall like and insect. With the rope he used to scale down was cut by Klove, Paul climbs up the sheer outer wall to go after Sarah, knowing that Dracula may use her as his new mistress.
 familiar to remove Sarahs crucifix. Just then, Klove arrives on the battlements attacks the Count with the dagger the vampire used to murder Tania. But the servant is hopelessly outmatched by the vampires inhuman strength and is thrown over the side of the castle by Dracula. 

Simon arrives and throws a heavy iron spike at the Count with the intention of staking him in the heart. the spike pierces the Count, but on the wrong side of the chest. Unharmed, Dracula raises the spike ready to impale Simon. But the spike is struck by lightning and Dracula, is immediately engulfed in flames. Staggering in agony, the Count collapses and topples over the castles battlements before falling to the far ground below where his corpse continues to burn fiercely...
