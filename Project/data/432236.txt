The success of The Pee-wee Herman Show prompted Warner Bros. to hire Paul Reubens to write a script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens original idea was to do a remake of Pollyanna#1960 film|Pollyanna with Pee-wee Herman in the Hayley Mills role. Reubens claims that Pollyanna is his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Brothers had a bike to get around the backlot, and so he requested one of his own. This inspired Reubens to start on a new script. Paul Reubens, Tim Burton, audio commentary, 2000, Warner Bros. 

Having left The Walt Disney Company and with Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie receiving positive reviews within film studios, Tim Burton was looking for a full-length film to direct. When Reubens and the producers of Pee-wees Big Adventure saw Burtons work on Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent and Frankenweenie, they decided to hire Burton for their film.  Burton felt he connected with Reubens personality and the humor of the Pee-wee Herman Show.  After hiring Burton to direct, Reubens, Phil Hartman and Michael Varhol reworked the script again.

To compose the film score, Burton brought in Danny Elfman, who had previously composed the music for Forbidden Zone.  He relished the opportunity to compose an orchestral score rather than a pop score and wanted to it to be taken as the work of a composer rather than the dabbling of a pop musician.  Elfman already had the main title theme written before he signed on.  At the time, Elfman was the lead singer of Oingo Boingo, but the working relationship between Burton and Elfman would overshadow his performing life and continue for most of Burtons films.

Variety (magazine)|Variety compared Paul Reubens to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton,  while Empire (magazine)|Empire called the film "a one-comic masterpiece" and "a dazzling debut" for Burton.  Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com explained "Everything about Pee-wees Big Adventure, from its toy-box colors to its superb, hyper-animated Danny Elfman score to the butch-waxed hairdo and wooden-puppet walk of its star and mastermind is pure pleasure."  Burton was offered the opportunity to direct Big Top Pee-wee,  but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, Beetlejuice. Positive reviews of Beetlejuice and the financial success of Pee-wees Big Adventure prompted Warner Bros. to offer Burton the directors helm for Batman (1989 film)|Batman. 

Roger Ebert never officially reviewed Pee-Wees Big Adventure but in 1987 it topped his list of Guilty Pleasures and he did mention it in his review of Big Top Pee-wee saying the sequel was not as magical as the first.

Warner Home Video released Pee-wees Big Adventure on DVD in May 2000. The release included audio commentary by Tim Burton, Paul Reubens and Danny Elfman as well as deleted scenes.
