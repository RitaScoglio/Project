==Plot==
 Senate investigation trailers for fictional movies that are usually not connected to one another. These are being shown during a Congressional Oversight Committee hearing as a representative day of TunnelVision programming. At the end of the film, the committee finds in favor of TunnelVision, but the network president is shot and killed by a crazed French chef who had been a running gag throughout the segments.
