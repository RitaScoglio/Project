==Synopsis==
Foots Pulardos is a mobster who intends to go on the lam to Mexico with his moll, Sugar Pye. In the meantime, he applies for a Diners Club card that is mistakenly approved by a meek clerk, Ernie Klenk, who is told to go get it back.

Foots uses a gym as a front for his racketeering operations. As soon as Ernie gets there, Foots finds out that they share a unique physical similarity. It gives him an ideaâ€”he will burn down the gym, with Ernie in it, and change identities to fool the law.

Complications pile up. The more involved Ernie gets with Sugar, the more jealous his girlfriend Lucy becomes. And when the corrupt couple head for the airport, its up to Ernie to figure out a way to stop them, which he does.

==Production== Stu Phillips and the cinematography by Hal Mohr.

Diners Club is spelled Diners Club in the films title, as seen on the poster.
