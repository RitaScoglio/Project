Quartet  is a 1948 British anthology film with four segments, each based on a story by W. Somerset Maugham. Each segment is introduced by the author. It was successful enough to produce two sequels Trio (1950 film)|Trio (1950) and Encore (1951 film)|Encore (1951), and popularised the compendium film format, leading to films such as O. Henrys Full House in 1952.

The screenplays for the stories were all written by R. C. Sherriff.

===Plot===
On George Blands twenty-first birthday, his father, of the landed gentry, asks him what he intends to do with his life. Georges answer is incomprehensible to his entire family: he wants to become a concert pianist. His family, who want him to succeed to his fathers place and title, try to talk him out of it. Finally, his cousin Paula (who is in love with him) comes up with a compromise: he will study in Paris for two years, after which an impartial expert will determine whether he has it in him to reach his goal. 

The two years ended, Paula gets Lea Markart, a world-famous pianist, to do the judging. After listening to Georges recital, Markart tells him that, while his technique is excellent, he lacks the talent and inspiration of a true artist and could never be more than a good amateur.

George is killed later that day with a blast to the chest from a gun he was supposedly cleaning. His family is anxious that his death be ruled accidental, and, at the inquest, the coroners jury returns such a verdict with clear consciences, since, in the words of the plainspoken foreman, the jurors cannot accept that a gentleman such as the deceased would have killed himself "just cause he couldnt play piano good."

A colonels mousy wife writes a book of poetry under a pseudonym but is immediately unmasked by the papers. The colonel does not read the poetry (although he says he has) and is surprised when a friend says it is "not suitable for children." Another friend says it has "naked, earthy passion" and compares it to Sappho. The book is a success and sells "like hot-cakes," becoming the talk of the town. Even the colonels mistress has an interest in it.

After listening to much talk about how "sexy" the book is, the colonel finally asks his mistress to borrow her copy, then insists she tell him about it. The book is about a middle-aged woman falling in love with, and having an affair with, a younger man, told in the first person. After a torrid affair, the younger man dies. The mistress says it is so vivid that it must be based on a real experience, but the colonel insists his wife is “too much of a lady,” and that it must be fiction. Still, he is tortured by the insinuation that is could be true but is too afraid to ask his wife about it.

Eventually, of course, sensing his unease, she tells him the passion was based on his love for her, as it was when they were young. She blames herself for the "death" of that love. They end in an embrace.
