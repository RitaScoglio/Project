==Plot==
   
God and Lucifer are engaged in a war for the souls of humanity; a standing wager for the souls of all mankind. Angels and demons are forbidden to manifest on Earth, but they are allowed to possess and influence humans, and half-breeds are used to peddle influence. Exorcist John Constantine was born with the power to see angels and demons. At age 15, he committed suicide to escape his visions, but he was revived after spending two minutes in Hell, and his soul is bound for Hell when he dies for the sin of taking his own life.
 androgynous half-breed Gabriel (Tilda Chas Kramer (Shia LeBeouf). Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) shows up at Constantines apartment to ask for his help investigating Isabel (Rachel Weisz), her identical twins, death. Isabel leapt from the top of a psychiatric hospital, where she was a patient; and, despite camera footage showing it, Angela is convinced that Isabel would never commit suicide. At first, John mocks her and denies her request for help; but, after demons chase after Angela on the street outside, Constantine agrees to help.
 Spear of blood of Jesus Christ. After John and Angela leave, Balthazar is destroyed by a Mammon possessed individual. Angela, now possessing the psychic abilities Mammon requires, is abducted by an unseen force and brought to Isabels hospital. John convinces Midnite that the balance is no longer in force, and asks to  use "The Chair", an old electric chair. The Chair shows John a vision of how the spear was discovered in Mexico and has been brought to Los Angeles. John and Chas head to the hospital and interrupt the ritual, but Chas is beaten to death by an unseen force in the process.
 sigils tattooed Lucifer arrives to personally collect his soul. John tells Lucifer about Mammon’s plan to usurp him and Lucifer sends Mammon back to Hell. When Gabriel attempts to smite Lucifer, the angels power is nullified and Gabriels wings are burned off (implied by God having turned his back on Gabriel for Gabriels complicity). In return for his help, Lucifer grants John a favor; instead of a longer life, he asks Lucifer to allow Isabel to go to Heaven. Lucifer agrees, but then finds that he is unable to drag John to Hell; Johns noble sacrifice sees him granted entry to Heaven. Infuriated at losing John Constantines soul, Lucifer resurrects him and removes his cancer, claiming that John will eventually prove he belongs in Hell. Freed from Mammons possession, Angela departs with John, leaving behind the now human Gabriel. Some time later, John gifts the Spear to Angela, asking her to hide it. As she leaves, instead of producing a cigarette, he starts to chew on some nicotine gum.

In a post-credits scene, John visits Chas grave. Chas appears before him as an angel and flies upward to the sky.

== Production ==
  Paul Hunter was attached to direct,  followed by Tarsem Singh in 2001.  Warner Bros. hoped Singh could begin filming in 2002 with Nicolas Cage attached to star in the lead role  but Singh ended up dropping out, a move that inspired dueling lawsuits from Tarsem and Warners. Keanu Reeves became attached in 2002. 

Constantine was written using some elements from   and originally came from Liverpool.  The film was also set in Los Angeles, with the director pointing out that the comic book was not exclusively set in London either. 
 Ellie in the Hellblazer comics, were cut from the movie to make Constantine more of a lonely character. 

The film’s title was changed from Hellblazer to Constantine to avoid confusion with the Clive Barker Hellraiser films.  The comics series itself was originally to be titled Hellraiser but was also retitled to avoid confusion with the film, released the previous year.   

 
Director Francis Lawrence decided to base the idea of Hell "on the geography of whats around us now."  He further explained:
 

The novelization further describes Hells setting in that the buildings are lined with blood instead of mortar, and built with the souls of the damned rather than brick.   

In a 2011 interview with MTV Splash Page director Francis Lawrence spoke of a potential sequel, saying:

== Release ==
 
The original announced release date was Sept. 17, 2004 before it was pushed back. 
 video game adaption of the film was also produced. Warner Home Video announced that the film was to be released on HD DVD on March 28, 2006.  It would be one of the earliest titles to be released on that media format. However, following delays to the launch of the HD DVD format (which pushed back the release of many of the initially announced titles), Constantine eventually made its debut on HD DVD on June 6, 2006. Warner Home Video released a Blu-ray Disc version of the film on October 14, 2008. 

== Critical response == normalized rating of 46% based on the reviews of 217 critics with an average rating of 5.5/10.  At Metacritic, an aggregation site which assigns a weighted average, the film holds a rating of 50 out of 100 based on the reviews of 41 critics. 

Richard Corliss of Time (magazine)|Time magazine praised the film calling it "a one-of-a-kind hybrid: a theological noir action film".  In crediting the actors, he specifically cited Keanu Reeves ability to "retain his charisma in   weird-silly moment" in addition to the performances of Tilda Swinton whom he referred to as "immaculately decadent". He also praised Francis Lawrences usage of a significant number of camera locations and angles. He was, however, critical of the movies climax, referring to it as "irrevocably goofy".

Ella Taylor of Los Angeles Weekly|L.A. Weekly gave the film positive feedback, stating, "Constantine, which opts in the end for what I can only describe as a kind of supernatural humanism, is not without its spiritual satisfactions."  Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "Keanu Reeves has no peer when it comes to playing these sort of messianic roles—he infuses them with a Zen blankness and serenity that somehow gets him through even the unlikeliest scenes with a quiet, unassuming dignity." 

Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat gave the film three stars out of five, stating that "the film (barely) succeeds, thanks to impressive visuals, the idea of an uncaring God wagering with Satan for souls, and two immensely enjoyable scenes (one with Weisz, one with Stormare) in which Reeves actually plays his character as the cynical asshole he really is." 

Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News gave the film a 2.5 out of 5, stating, "For all its spiritual angst, Constantine is about as silly as fantasies get."  Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun also gave the film a 2.5 out of 5, stating, "It all comes off as a case of filmmakers wanting to have their communion wafer and eat it, too."  Desson Thomson, a writer for The Washington Post, had similar sentiments of the film,  specifically panning the films distancing from the comic book upon which it is based:
  Leonard Maltins annual publication "TV Movies" gives the film a BOMB rating, describing it as "dreary, to say the least." 
Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars,  panning the depiction of hell ("a post-nuclear Los Angeles created by animators with a hangover"), the premise of the film itself, ("You would think that God would be the New England Patriots of this contest, but apparently there is a chance that Satan could win."), plot holes, inconsistencies, and general actions depicted throughout the film. He was not particularly critical of the films acting, only mentioning it by stating, "Reeves has a deliberately morose energy level in the movie, as befits one who has seen hell, walks among half-demons, and is dying. He keeps on smoking." He added it to his list of "most hated" films. 

==Sequel==
In November 2012, it was reported that Guillermo del Toro and Warner Bros. were considering a movie featuring DC Comics supernatural characters, which includes John Constantine. It isnt confirmed if itll be connected to the film or if Keanu Reeves will reprise his role.
