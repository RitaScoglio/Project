==Plot==
Margaret Ford (Crouse) is a psychiatrist. She has published a book, Driven: Compulsion and Obsession in Everyday Life, which has made her financially well off. One day, shes in a session with Billy, a compulsive gambler who informs her that his life is in danger. He owes $25,000 to a criminal figure&nbsp;— money he doesnt have&nbsp;— and if he doesnt pay, he will be killed.
 tell of another gambler (Jay).

Exhilarated by the tension, Margaret even volunteers $6,000 of her own money to back up Mikes bet because she’s spotted the tell that Mikes opponent is bluffing. Things go wrong. Not only does the player have a winning hand, he also brandishes a gun, demanding the $6,000 she promised as collateral. It is only when Margaret sees a drop of water fall from the pistol barrel that she realizes the whole setup is a con&nbsp;– designed strictly to take her money. Mike and his men see that the jig is up, and nonchalantly pack up the con. Mike apologizes, saying it was "only business ... nothing personal."

Back in her normal routine, Margaret continues to think about her night at the House of Games. She returns, proposing to Mike that she follow him around, learn the ins and outs of his world, perhaps write a book on the experience. Mike is skeptical but agrees. He shows her first-hand how a con game works. Her fascination grows. They end up going to a hotel room and making love.

Mike mentions that he has a role in another con that night. Margaret is eager to tag along. Mike, his associate Joey (Mike Nussbaum), and their mark (Walsh) come upon a briefcase of money that someone seems to have accidentally left on the street before getting into a cab. The three men go to the marks hotel room to keep an eye on each other and discuss what to do with the cash.

Mike confides to Margaret that the $80,000 in cash is real, borrowed from the mob and due back the next day. The plan is to have the mark propose paying Mike and Joey a percentage in exchange for taking the briefcase, but they will switch the case at the last minute.

Margaret sees and hears what no one else does: that the mark has a gun and a two-way radio, planning to arrest the con artists. Margaret warns Mike and Joey its a trap. A scuffle develops and the cop/mark is killed when his gun discharges. Mike, Margaret and Joey steal a car and escape. But the briefcase is nowhere to be found; its been left behind in the commotion. Mike knows the consequences of failing to return the mobs money. Margaret has fallen for Mike and fears for his safety, as well as her own. She offers to replace the $80,000.

Overwhelmed by the experience, Margaret is visited by Billy, her patient, who stops by briefly to cancel his appointment scheduled for the next day. By sheer chance, she spots Billy leaving in a car that is the very escape vehicle used during the hotel getaway. Margaret puts the pieces together. She spies on the con men—among whom is the "dead" cop/mark—and sees for herself that everything was a ruse to swindle her out of $80,000; making love to her, she overhears Mike say, was "a small price to pay."

Margaret has a gun (one she took from Billy in their earlier session). She has overheard when Mike is leaving town and lies in wait at the airport. At first she puts on an act, pleading to travel with him with an additional $250,000 she says she has brought. Mike coaxes her into a deserted dock of the airport where they can be alone. When she misspeaks, Mike realizes that Margaret knows the score. He tells her coldly theres nothing she can do about it and turns to leave. Margaret pulls out her gun and demands that Mike beg for his life. He refuses and she shoots him to death.

Later, we see that Margaret has gone on with her life, a changed woman, now able to "forgive herself", as her mentor had urged her to do. She shows no sign of guilt or remorse for murdering Mike. She steals a gold lighter out of the purse of another woman in a restaurant and relishes the acquisition.
