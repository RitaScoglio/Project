==Plot==
Rupert Pupkin (De Niro), a stage-door autograph hound, is an aspiring stand-up comedian whose ambition far exceeds his talent. After meeting Jerry Langford (Lewis), a successful comedian and talk show host, Rupert believes his "big break" has finally come. He attempts to get a place on the show but is continually rebuffed by Langfords staff and, finally, by Langford himself.

Along the way, Rupert indulges in elaborate and obsessive fantasies where he and Langford are colleagues and friends. He even takes a date, Rita, to Langfords home, uninvited, trying to impress her.
 stalker who is also obsessed with Langford. As ransom, Rupert demands that he be given the opening spot on that evenings Jerry Langford Show (guest hosted by Tony Randall), and that the show be broadcast in normal fashion. The network brass, lawyers, and the FBI agree, with the understanding that Langford will be released once the show airs. Between the taping of the show and the broadcast, Masha has her "dream date" with Langford, who is duct-taped to a chair in her parents Manhattan townhouse. Jerry convinces her to untie him and escapes.
 schmuck for a lifetime."

The movie closes with a news report of Ruperts release from prison, set to a montage of storefronts stocking his "long awaited" autobiography, King For a Night. The report informs that Rupert still considers Jerry Langford his mentor and friend and that he and his agent are currently weighing several "attractive offers".

The final scene shows Rupert taking the stage for an apparent TV special with a live audience and an announcer enthusiastically introducing and praising him.

== Production == The Last Temptation of Christ, and wanted De Niro to play Jesus Christ. De Niro was not interested and preferred their next collaboration to be a comedy. He had purchased the rights of a script by a film critic, Paul D. Zimmerman. Baxter, John De Niro A Biography pp.&nbsp;219/20.  Scorsese pondered whether he could face shooting another film, particularly with a looming strike by the Writers Guild of America. Producer Arnon Milchan knew he could do the project away from Hollywood interference by filming entirely on location in New York and deliver it on time with the involvement of a smaller film company. 

In the biography/overview of his work, Scorsese on Scorsese, the director had high praise for Jerry Lewis, stating that during their first conversation before shooting, Lewis was extremely professional and assured him before shooting that there would be no ego clashes or difficulties. Scorsese said he felt Lewis performance in the film was vastly underrated and deserved more acclaim. 

After such a strong critical appreciation for the way in which Scorsese had shot Raging Bull, the director felt that The King of Comedy needed more of a raw cinematic style, one of which would take its cues from early silent cinema, using more static camera shots, and less dramatic close-ups. Scorsese has noted that Edwin S. Porters 1903 film, Life of an American Fireman, had greatly influenced The King of Comedys visual style. 

According to an interview with Lewis in the February 7, 1983 edition of People (magazine)|People magazine, he claimed that Scorsese and De Niro employed method acting tricks, including making a slew of anti-Semitic epithets during the filming in order to "pump up Lewiss anger."  Lewis described making the film as a pleasurable experience and noted that he got along well with both Scorsese and De Niro. Lewis said he was invited to collaborate on certain aspects of the script dealing with celebrity life. He suggested an ending in which Rupert Pupkin kills Jerry, but was turned down. As a result, Lewis thought that the film, while good, did not have a "finish." Bogdanovinch, Peter. Who The Hells In It, p.196.  In an interview for the DVD, Scorsese stated that Jerry Lewis suggested that the brief scene where Jerry Langford is accosted by an old lady for autographs, who screams "you should only get cancer!" when Lewis politely rebuffs her, was based on a real-life incident that happened to Lewis. Scorsese said Lewis directed the actress playing the old lady to get the timing right.

===Screenplay===
Scorsese first became aware of Paul D. Zimmermans script after it was brought to him by Robert De Niro in 1974, but declined the project citing that he felt no personal connection with it.  Michael Cimino was attached to direct, however Ciminos involvement with the script fell through, when he left the project to instead direct Heavens Gate (film)|Heavens Gate. Prompted by the alienation he felt from his growing celebrity status,   and De Niro’s claims that the film could be made "real fast", and that it would be a "New York movie"  Scorsese’s interest in the project was rekindled.

=== Casting ===
Scorseses first choice for talk show host Jerry Langford was Johnny Carson. Carson refused the role, claiming "you know that one take is enough for me." Christie and Thompson, Ian and David. Scorsese on Scorsese, p.89.  The entire Rat Pack was also considered—specifically Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin—before a decision was made to select Martins old partner, Jerry Lewis.  

===Principle photography===

Arnon Milchan suggested shooting began a month earlier than scheduled in order to avoid possible work stoppage from the DGA strike. Furthermore, Scorsese was not in good health. The film was shot over a twenty week period, with Scorsese shooting from 4pm to 7pm everyday.   

===Scorseses health===

Scorsese had suffered from poor health both before and during the films production. He had previously worked on three films close together and not long after, found himself hospitalised due to exhaustion and pneumonia. He had not recovered when shooting began.  The intensive filming schedule meant Scorsese could spend the remainder of his time recuperating. 

=== Music ===
Robbie Robertson produced the music for the films soundtrack and contributed his first original work after leaving The Band entitled "Between Trains".  This song, a tribute to a member of the production staff who had suddenly passed away, is on the soundtrack album but not in the movie itself. Bob James. The Aviator and The Departed.

==Distribution==
The King of Comedy was released on DVD on December 12, 2002 (Region 1) and 19 April 2004 (Region 2).

A digital restoration of the movie was presented on April 27, 2013 as the closing film of De Niros Tribeca Film Festival. This latest version was produced from the film’s original camera negatives and features a restored soundtrack.    While the restored film was scheduled to be released onto Blu-ray on October 29, 2013,  the 30th Anniversary home media release was ultimately delayed for a release date of March 25, 2014. 

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Rotten Tomatoes reported that 91% of 43 critics gave the film positive reviews. Its critical consensus states: "Largely misunderstood upon its release, The King of Comedy today looks eerily prescient, and features a fine performance by Robert De Niro as a strangely sympathetic psychopath."   Although the film was well received by critics, it bombed at the box office. De Niro said that the film "...maybe wasnt so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didnt want to look at or know." Friedman Lawrence S. The Films of Martin Scorsese 1997, p.133. 
 Timeout called Taxi Driver The Last Temptation of Christ. Which is a shame, because its Scorseses second greatest film, after Taxi Driver.   
However, not all critics gave the film positive reviews. Adam Smith of Empire Magazine called it "Neither funny enough to be an effective black comedy nor scary enough to capitalise on its thriller/horror elements". 

David Ehrenstein, author of The Scorsese Picture noted the mixed response of the film in his 1983 review. He stated that The King of Comedy "cuts too close to the bone for either large-scale mass audience approval or unanimous mainstream critical acclaim". He noted how far apart the film stood to other films made in the early years of Reagans America which the film presented a very critical portrayal of (although the script was written well before Reagans election, and shooting began less than five months after Reagan took office). "At a time when the film world piles on simple-minded sentiment in thick gooey gobs, a picture like The King of Comedy appears a frontal assault.   The triumph of the little guy is revealed to be nothing more than lumpen neo-Fascist blood lust." 
 New York, New York collapsed into anti-acting after he started turning himself into repugnant flesh eggies of soulless characters.....Pupkin is a nothing." Scorsese says that "people were confused with King of Comedy and saw Bob as some sort of mannequin". Scorsese has called De Niros role as Rupert Pupkin his favorite of all their collaborations. Friedman Lawrence S. The Films of Martin Scorsese 1997, p.127. 

== Legacy ==
 sociopath character of John E. du Pont in Foxcatcher. 

=== Parody ===
The confrontation scene at Jerrys house between Pupkin and Langford was parodied on Saturday Night Live soon after the films release, when Lewis hosted the show.  The sketch, featuring Tim Kazurinsky and Mary Gross, features Lewis visiting a studio in Paris, France and meeting a voice actor who performs the French-language dubs for Lewis characters in all his movies.  However, Jerry is dismayed when he learns that the actor reads it all in the "nine-year-old boy" style that was part of Lewis comedy routines during his days with Dean Martin.  The actor tries to kill himself out of shame when Lewis rebukes him, but Lewis stops it.

===Debate about ending===
Film scholar David Bordwell, writing in Film Viewers Guide, mentioned the (un)reality of the ending as a topic for debate, as there is no definitive answer as to whether the ending is reality or fantasy.  By the end of the film the line between fantasy and reality is blurred for the audience as well as the character. Scorsese doesnt offer a clear answer but forces the audience to make their own minds up from how they individually read the film.

In his commentary on The Criterion Collection DVD of Black Narcissus, Scorsese stated that Michael Powells films influenced The King of Comedy in its conception of fantasy. Scorsese said that Powell always treated fantasy as no different than reality, and so made fantasy sequences as realistic as possible. Scorsese suggests that Rupert Pupkins character fails to differentiate between his fantasies and reality in much the same way.  Scorsese sought to achieve the same with the film so that, in his words, the "fantasy is more real than reality".
