Vernon, Florida is a 1981 documentary film produced and directed by Errol Morris profiling various residents living within the town of Vernon, Florida. Originally titled Nub City, this follow-up to Gates of Heaven was initially focused on residents of the Southern town who cut off their own limbs as a way to collect insurance money. After Morriss life was threatened by the subjects of the film, he re-worked Nub City into Vernon, Florida. 

Various clips of the movie would later be included as intro/outro segments for The Heart, She Holler.
