==Plot==
The comedic tone was established by the following disclaimer at the end of the opening credits:
 
This was meant to underscore the fact that the actual event portrayed in the film was, as stated in its Official Entry Regulations, "NOT A RACE." 
 fashion model Rosalind Peters (Kay Kendall) and her pet St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard ride in a 1905 Spyker. 

The journey to Brighton goes well for Claverhouse, but the McKims trip is complicated by several breakdowns, and they arrive very late. As Alan cancelled their accommodation in their usual plush hotel during a fit of pique, they are forced to spend the night in a dingy run-down hotel (with a noteworthy cameo performance by Joyce Grenfell as the proprietress) leaving Wendy feeling less than pleased.

 pounds that he can beat Ambrose back to London, despite racing not being allowed by the club. Ambrose accepts the bet—"First over Westminster Bridge."

The following morning, despite Rosalinds massive hangover and Wendys determined disapproval of the whole business, the two crews race back to London. Each driver is determined that his car is the better, come what may, and they both resort to various forms of cheating. Ambrose sabotages Alans engine, and Alan causes Ambrose to be stopped by the police.

Finally, on the outskirts of London (West Drayton), both cars are stopped by traffic police and the four contestants are publicly warned after Alan and Ambrose come to blows. At Wendys insistence, they decide to call off the bet and have a party instead. But whilst waiting for the public house to open, words are exchanged and the bet is on again.

The two cars race neck-and-neck through the southern suburbs of London. But with only a few yards to go, Genevieve breaks down. As Ambroses car is about to overtake it, its tyres become stuck in tramlines (Londons tram network had closed in 1952 but many of the tracks were still in evidence when the film was made the following year) and it drives off in another direction. The brakes on Genevieve fail and the car rolls a few yards onto Westminster Bridge, thus winning the bet.
