}} book of the same name about life in late 1950s London. The film was directed by Julien Temple, featured David Bowie and Sade Adu|Sade, and a breakthrough role by Patsy Kensit. The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.   

Upon its release on 18 April 1986, Absolute Beginners received immense coverage in the British media. At the time, the British film industry was perceived as being on the point of collapse (with the recent failure of the film Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution). However, the movie was panned by critics and became a box office flop. Some of the criticisms included stylistic anachronisms, such as the mini-skirt and decidedly 1980s music from the likes of The Style Council and Sade (band)|Sade, the bowdlerisation of Kensits character (Crepe Suzette had been depicted as a promiscuous "negrophile" in the book), and the casting of Bowie, who made it a condition of his musical contribution.

Absolute Beginners has subsequently gained status as a cult movie , in part due to its soundtrack . Some people  compare the movie as the British equivalent of Streets of Fire; a 1984 American movie that was a retro-stylized rock movie with a notable soundtrack and also a commercial failure.
 The Mission, led to the collapse of Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest, a major British film studio.
