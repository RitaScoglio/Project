==Plot==
Gowtam (Navdeep) is youngest of three sons of Collector Shambhu Prasad (Nassar). His wife Chaya Rani is a professor, eldest son (Manoj) is a doctor, second one (Neeraj) is a businessman, and his daughters-in-law are also in a well-to-do status. But his last son fails to go beyond S.S.C.. Gowtam is more close to his neighbors Dr. Bhanu (Bhanupriya) and Kondal Rao (Prithvi) than his family. He is not respected in the family and doesnt have a clear goal in life. He also builds a strong friendship with tutor Janaki (Sindhu), who teaches his brothers kids. Though Mr. Prasad ignores his sons small gaffes, he doesnt spare him when he comes to know that Gowtam forged his signature. He throws him out of house. Now homeless, Gowtam is taken by Janaki to her house. There, he starts working as a mechanic repairing vehicles. He gets inspired by the words of Bhanu (Bhanu Priya) and plunges himself into automobile repairing. He invents a carburettor that gives a mileage of 120&nbsp;km per liter and makes his brother as the patentee for his apparatus. He saves his eldest brother from a conspiracy of hospital management and also fixes marriage of his sister with her lover. In spite of doing all good to his family he never lets his father to know about these things as his father always wishes to see his third son as an I.A.S. officer. He strives for that and his love is also not informed of his efforts. Movie ends with sharing his triumph with his father.
