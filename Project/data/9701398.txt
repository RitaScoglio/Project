==Plot==
 
The film tells the story of Ariel Perelman (Daniel Hendler).  While he has an easygoing lifestyle, hes trying to find his way in life in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He works at a university as a law professor. The film begins with a long narration of the way things stand in his life.  He describes his father, Bernardo Perelman (Arturo Goetz), in detail. Perelman, as hes known, is a popular public defender who meets his clients where they work or in restaurants so he can determine what they are "all about." Most of his clients are generally poor.  Hes very close to his secretary (Adriana Aizemberg) since his wife died fifteen years ago.  Work fills Perelmans days, and Ariel is astonished by his energy.

After lusting after Sandra (Julieta Díaz), an attractive woman who takes his class, Ariel decides to chase her and takes the Pilates class she teaches. Not much happens until Sandra is sued for teaching Pilates without the approval of the company who hold the rights to teach Pilates in Argentina.  Ariel (known as Perelman to Sandra) reaches out to his father for help and wins the law suit.

In the process, Sandra falls in love with the younger Perelman and they marry.  She begins to decorate their home for a few years and they have a child they name Gastón (Eloy Burman), who is a quite charming young boy. 

Ariels university building is shut down for a month because it had collapsed, and he is given some time off.  However, he doesnt share this news with his wife.  During this time his father starts spending some quality time with Ariel, which makes him think something must be wrong.  Ariel is asked by the Swiss kindergarten school Gastón attends to participate in a play and swim classes with the other fathers. Ariel first rebels but gives in.

The film ends with his fathers death and burial and a long introspective look at Ariel Perelmans life in his 30s.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
 
Family Law garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics. On review aggregate website  , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 66 based on 18 reviews, classified as a generally favorably reviewed film. 

Jonathon Holland, film critic of Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine, liked the films story and wrote, "A deft, witty and emotionally rewarding study of a thirtysomething man in his roles as father and son, Daniel Burmans intensely personal "Family Law" completes his fatherhood trilogy. The second installment, "Lost Embrace", won the Silver Bear at Berlin in 2004. Again featuring an outstanding Daniel Hendler (best actor in 2004) and a script that fuses sharp observation with the intimacy of a lightly rewritten autobiography, pic effortlessly takes the viewer through a range of thoughts and moods. Fans of "Embrace" might lament the relative absence of social context this time, but pics multiple merits should consolidate helmers   burgeoning offshore reputation." 

The senior film writer at the San Francisco Chronicle, Ruthe Stein, liked the comedy-dramas screenplay, the direction and acting, writing, "Family Law—a subtly perceptive charmer that was Argentinas entry for a best foreign film Oscar and might have been nominated in a less competitive year—is in no particular hurry to get where its going...Although Hendler and Goetz dont really look alike, they manage to convey a family resemblance in their mannerisms, particularly the erect way they carry themselves, as if theyre somebody...Aizemberg works wonders. You get the sense from her radiance that the secretary has always had a thing for her boss. His wifes death allowed her to finally express it physically, and shes overjoyed by their intimacy...Ultimately this is a movie about a sons discovery of the man he knows mostly as a father. Its a serious subject handled with humor—not the ha-ha kind, but the hard laughter that comes from recognizing parts of yourself in the Perelmans." 

Critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, of the website Spirituality and Practice like the film and wrote, "Family Law explores in a realistic and touching way the emotional barriers that often block intimate conversation between fathers and sons...Its easy today to send e-mails and faxes anywhere in the world, yet we rarely speak to those who live in our neighborhood. We have cellular telephones and pagers, yet we spend very little time in deep conversation with those in our immediate family. This strange phenomenon is depicted very poignantly in this snappy and satisfying film from Argentina written and directed by Daniel Burman. We were very impressed with his Lost Embrace about a father and son reunion after years apart. This one also deals with a father and son relationship."
