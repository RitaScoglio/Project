Time Regained ( ) is a 1999 French drama film directed by the Chilean filmmaker Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz. It is an adaptation of the final volume of In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust. The plot is about the anonymous narrator of In Search of Lost Time who reflects on his past experiences while lying on his deathbed.

The choice to develop the last volume of In Search of Lost Time allows the film to refer to the entire series of books. For example, the film shows an episode of the first novel, Swanns Way, usually referred to as "the lady in pink", as a flashback of Time Regained.

The film was entered into the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.
