===Oscar controversy=== Best Foreign 79th Academy Ahimsa ... Stop to Run, which upset the Invisible Waves production company, Five Star Production. The film federation said that the reason for the change was that a print of the film wouldnt be available in time to send to the Academy for consideration, but Five Star, sales agent Fortissimo Films and distributor Palm Pictures stated that was not true.
