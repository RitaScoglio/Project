Get Over It is a 2001 American teen comedy loosely based on William Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream about a high school senior who desperately tries to win back his ex-girlfriend by joining the school play she and her new boyfriend are performing in, against the advice of friends. The film was directed by Tommy OHaver for Miramax Films and written by R. Lee Fleming, Jr.. The film stars Ben Foster, Kirsten Dunst, Melissa Sagemiller, Mila Kunis, Sisq贸, Colin Hanks, Shane West, and Martin Short.

== Plot ==
Berke Landers (Ben Foster) and his girlfriend Allison (Melissa Sagemiller) were the quintessential high-school couple, but she breaks up with him immediately after the film begins. She then begins a new relationship with Striker (Shane West), a foreign student who was once the lead singer of a boy band. When Allison and Striker audition for the schools upcoming musical, Berke desperately tries to win Allison back by also auditioning for the play, despite having no theatrical talent and having a busy schedule as a member of the basketball team. Meanwhile, Berkes friends Felix (Colin Hanks) and Dennis (Sisq贸) try to find a new girlfriend for him.

With the help of Felixs younger sister, Kelly (Kirsten Dunst), a talented songwriter and singer, Berke wins a minor role in the play, a modern musical version of Shakespeares comedy A Midsummer Nights Dream called A Midsummer Nights Rockin Eve, written and directed by the schools domineering drama teacher, Dr. Desmond Oates (Martin Short). Striker plays Demetrius, Allison plays Hermia, Kelly plays Helena (A Midsummer Nights Dream)|Helena, and Lysander is to be played by the schools star actor, Peter Wong (Christopher Jacot). But after Peter is injured in a freak accident, Striker nominates Berke to take over the role of Lysander, and, still intent on winning Allison back, Berke accepts. He gradually improves with continuing assistance from Kelly, but remains unaware of the growing attraction between the two of them. Meanwhile, Oates blames Kellys singing for his own poorly written song and rejects her suggestions to improve it.

At a party at Berkes house, Kelly kisses Berke, but he insists that a relationship between them could not work because she is Felixs sister. She leaves him, annoyed at his unwillingness to move on with his life, and Felix, coming across the two, punches Berke. At the same party, Berke and Allison catch Striker cheating on Allison with her best friend Maggie (Zoe Saldana), and so Allison breaks up with Striker.

On the plays opening night, the first half of the performance goes smoothly except for some onstage scuffling between Berke and Striker. During the intermission, Allison confides to Berke that she wants to get back together with him, leaving him with a difficult choice between her and Kelly. Meanwhile, Striker bribes two of the theater technicians to try and blow up Berke using stage pyrotechnics. Before the play resumes, Felix gives the orchestra sheet music for a love ballad written by Kelly to replace Oates unpopular tune. 

After the curtain rises, Kelly sings her song so beautifully that Berke is reminded of their time together and finally realizes he loves her. As the fourth act begins, he abandons his lines from the script and makes up his own verse professing his characters love for Kellys character Helena. The audience applauds as Berke and Kelly kiss. Striker protests this change, but unwittingly signals the technicians to set off the explosion, blowing him offstage. Kelly and Berke leave the theater after the show, looking forward to their future together as they discuss the next nights performance.
