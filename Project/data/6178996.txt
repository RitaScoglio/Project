 }}  and Alyn (Superman) spent much of their time, when not shooting, exchanging recipes; both actors shared an interest in cookery. 

===Special effects===
The final set piece shows Metropolis under attack by "poorly animated" flying saucers and a torpedo. 

The flying effects were somewhat improved in this film than in the original, by the simple expedient of turning the camera on its side. Kirk Alyn stood with arms raised in front of a cyclorama, while a wind machine and smoke pot were placed above him (out of frame). This gave an inexpensive illusion of flight. 
Longer shots continued to use cartoon animation of the Man of Steel.

==Critical appraisal==
In their book The Great Movie Serials, Jim Harman and Donald F. Glut describe the serial as "far more gimmicky and gadget prone" than the first Superman serial. In addition to this, they also found it to be "flawed by the same Katzman cheapness."
