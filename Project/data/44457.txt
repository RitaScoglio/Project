==Plot summary== horticulturalist and illegal alien from France, so he may obtain a green card. In turn, Brontë uses her fake marriage credentials to rent the apartment of her dreams. After moving in, to explain her spouses absence, she tells the doorman and neighbors he is conducting musical research in Africa.

Contacted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for an interview to determine if her marriage is legitimate, Brontë tracks down Georges, who is working as a waiter. Although the two have little time to get their facts straight, the agents who question them appear to be satisfied with their answers. But when one of the agents asks to use the bathroom and Georges directs him to a closet, their suspicions are aroused, and they schedule a full, formal interview to be conducted two days later at their office.
 liberal progressive environmental issues.
 impressionistic piano piece set to a poem about children and trees that they agree to donate their plants to the Green Guerrillas. When Brontës parents later arrive at the apartment for an unannounced visit, Georges pretends to be the handyman.

When Brontës boyfriend Phil returns from a trip, Georges reveals he is her husband. Brontë angrily kicks Georges out, but the pair nonetheless appear at the immigration interview the next day. The two are questioned separately, and when Georges is caught out by the interviewer, he confesses the marriage is a sham. He agrees to deportation but insists Brontë not be charged for her role in the charade. He lets Brontë believe the interview was a success and the two go their separate ways.

A few days later, Georges invites Brontë to join him at the cafe where they first met. When she notices one of the immigration agents is seated nearby, she realizes Georges is being deported, and finally aware she loves him, tries to stop him from leaving. Georges promises to write every day asking the same question "When are you coming, Cherie?", a line he had also used when describing their fabricated courtship to the INS. Then, Georges is deported back to France, just as they have admitted their love for each other.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film earned mixed reviews from critics, as it currently holds a 56% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.
 The Year Cyrano de Bergerac. But it is a sound, entertaining work of craftsmanship, a love story between two people whose meet is not as cute as it might have been." 

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film a "captivating romantic bonbon" and added, "Dont look for the originality and grit that distinguished Weirs Australian films Picnic at Hanging Rock and Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli, Green Card has all the heft of a potato chip. But Depardieus charm recognizes no language barriers, and MacDowell, the revelation of Sex, Lies, and Videotape, proves a fine, sexy foil."  Rita Kempley of the Washington Post said, "Like Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost and Pretty Woman, this romance is blissfully dependent on our staying good and starry-eyed, seduced by the charisma of the leads. And we do, despite its lackadaisical pace and disappointing ending." 

Variety (magazine)|Variety said, "Although a thin premise endangers its credibility at times, Green Card is a genial, nicely played romance."  Time Out London stated "Weirs first romantic comedy boasts a central relationship which is tentative and hopeful, a mood beautifully realised by Depardieu (venturing into new territory with a major English-speaking role). Complemented by the refined MacDowell, his gracious, generous performance is never dominating, and their exchanges offer unexpected pleasures. In terms of the genres conventions, Weir likens this film to a light meal. Its one to savour."  Channel 4 said, "Weirs film has its fair share of cute moments as the opposites slowly begin to attract, but this is largely over rated stuff, which proved curiously popular with critics on its release. Depardieu does his obnoxious-yet-strangely-lovable act with ease; however, the romantic comedy fixture MacDowell is less convincing." 

===Box office===
Green Card grossed $10,585,060 at the box office in Australia,   which is equivalent to $16,725,817 in 2009 dollars.
