==Plot== Garfield is Jon dressed as an elf, who says it is Christmas and Garfield must be treated to a large amount of lasagna before opening his gift, which consists of a robotic Santa Claus which reads minds and produces whatever Garfield wants, pleasing him until Jon actually wakes up Garfield, who realizes he was dreaming. Jon tells Garfield that it is Christmas Eve and Jon, Garfield, and Odie are going to the countryside to celebrate Christmas with Jons family on their farm. Garfield wonders why they always go to the farm and wonders why they never come to their place instead. During his drive to the farm, Jon talks about Christmas he had when he was a boy. Making their animated debuts are the sweet and always cooking Mom, hard working farmer Dad, mischievous, younger brother Doc Boy, and the tough as nails Grandma. Grandma and Garfield quickly grow a special bond. Jon, Garfield, and Odie take a walk, while Grandma spikes Moms sausage gravy by adding chili powder. Jon and Garfield return for dinner, while Odie works on something secretive and then sneaks back into the house. During dinner, Grandma sneaks some food to Garfield and Odie.

After dinner, they decorate the tree. Jon has Garfield to put the star on, as no one else can reach the top of the tree. Next, Mom asks Doc Boy to play a song on the piano. Grandma shoves Doc Boy aside, as he cannot sing and plays her version of "O Christmas Tree". Mom plays "Christmas In Your Heart", while Grandma tells Garfield about her beloved and deceased husband. Mom asks Dad to read a book called Binky: The Clown Who Saved Christmas. Dad is reluctant, as he is tired of reading it every year, but later reluctantly reads it anyway. While he slept that night, Garfield finds out about Odies suspicious activity and follows him to the barn and sees him make something out of a piece of wood, some wire, a plunger handle, and a hand rake. While there, Garfield stumbles upon some old letters and soon finds out that it must be fifty years old. Meanwhile, Jon and Doc Boy unexpectedly wake Dad up at around 1:30&nbsp;a.m. and ask him if it is time to open presents. However, Dad angrily tells them to go to bed in which Jon and Doc Boy ends up arguing with each other that it is technically Christmas morning. The next Christmas morning, just when it seems like all the presents have been opened, Garfield gives Grandma the letters he found in the barn. These letters were love notes written to Grandma by her husband from when they first met with each other and married. Garfield also finds out that Odie has been busy making his ultimate Christmas gift: a homemade back scratcher. This is a rare glimpse at Garfields other side, as Garfield learns one of the true meanings of Christmas - "Its not the giving, its not the getting, its the loving!" - and gladly thanks and embraces Odie for the gift he made. The episode ends with the whole family singing an up-beat country-style song and enjoying "a good old-fashioned Christmas".
