Ill Be There is a 2003 British comedy-drama film directed and co-written by Craig Ferguson, who, in his directorial debut, also stars in the film with singer Charlotte Church in her film debut.

==Plot==
Charlotte Church stars as a young girl who is blessed with a beautiful, natural singing voice although that is generally unknown. Her character was conceived (literally) the night her mother met a Scottish rock star (Craig Ferguson), but the couple fell out of touch and her dad never knew he had a daughter. Much later, he is "Involuntary commitment|sectioned" after a motorcycle accident is viewed as a suicide attempt, and he meets his now 16 year old daughter while confined to a psychiatric hospital. Her mother felt she had been betrayed by this guy and also has a father who is an old rocker she believed had also failed her so she does not want her daughter to be involved in what she sees as the decadent world of rock music. In spite of her mothers attempts to keep her apart from it though she and her dad get to know each other and become the family they should have been all along.
