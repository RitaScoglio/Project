The Battle of   animated film directed by Ivan Ivanov-Vano and Yuriy Norshteyn. The film is set to music by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov and uses Russian frescoes and paintings from the 14th–16th centuries. These are animated using 2-dimensional stop motion animation.

==Plot== Invisible City of Kitezh (made into a The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya|4-act opera by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov in 1907 in music|1907), which disappears under the waters of a lake to escape an attack by the Mongols. (Russia was under the Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol-Tartar yoke for a period of three centuries in the Middle Ages.)

The film itself follows the legend only loosely, however, and its highpoint is a battle between the Russian soldiers and the Mongol hordes, symbolizing a clash of cultures (the Virgin Mary appears early in the film, in effect watching over the Russian side of the battle).
