Barrie comes to the house and begs for forgiveness. He asks her to give him another chance for the sake of their daughter Blossom, and offers to grant finally Susan the divorce she seeks if he takes another drink.  Susan consents and agrees to spend the summer with the family, thus making Blossom very happy.  At first, Barrie is taken in by Susans new passion, believing it is a sign of maturity, but he suffers disappointment when he realizes it is simply another manifestation of her shallowness.
