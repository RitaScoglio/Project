}} Jack Davies, based on a story by Keble Howard.  It was Julie Christies second film.

The film opened at the Odeon Marble Arch on 7 February 1963 

==Plot== Scot living and working for a local government authority somewhere in the south of London. A shy young man, his main excitement comes from cycling. After hes forced off the road by an impatient car driver, he tracks down the owner, only to find that he is Commander Chingford (James Robertson Justice), the domineering and acerbic owner of a sportscar distributorship. 

Chingford reluctantly pays for the damage to Troons cycle, but more significantly, Troon meets Claire (Julie Christie), Chingfords beautiful blonde daughter. He is smitten with her and determines to buy a car so that he can take her out.
 Bentley Four and a half  litre engined Red Label Speed Model, painted in British Racing Green and named The Fast Lady.

Troon has his first driving lesson in a less exciting car, an Austin A40 Farina, which proves to be a comedy of disasters, with a nervous instructor (Eric Barker), but Fox then offers to teach him. The results are equally disastrous. 

Unwilling to give up, and determined to prove his love for Claire, Troon bets her father that he can drive the car. An experienced racing driver, Chingford is convinced that Troon has no hope of achieving this â€” and bets him that he cannot.

Troon takes Chingford for a drive in the Bentley and, as expected, loses the bet. But the tables are turned when Chingford loses Troons counter-bet that he (Chingford) can drive back home in less than 30 minutes. He reluctantly allows Claire to go out with Troon in the car.
 Jaguar car driven by escaping bank robbers. The high speed chase takes them through town and country, across a golf course (leaving in its wake, a trail of disasters) and eventually the robbers are (of course) caught. Chingford so admires his driving skill that he allows the couple to get engaged.

The film features cameos and performances by many well-known comedy and character actors, including Dick Emery as a car salesman, Clive Dunn, Gerald Campion, Frankie Howerd, Bernard Cribbins, Bill Fraser, Monsewer Eddie Gray and Fred Emney.

The Fast Lady, a 1927 Bentley 4.5 litre Red Label Speed model with Vanden Plas short chassis fabric body, registration number TU5987, still exists and was sold by a specialist dealer in 2010.
