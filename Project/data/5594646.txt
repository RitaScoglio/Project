Ethan has been dating former pro baseball player-turned-autobiographer Kyle Underhill for several months, so when Leo announces he plans to sell the house, Ethan starts dropping hints to Kyle that they should live together. Inexplicably, when Kyle actually asks him to move in, Ethan breaks up with him.

Ethan hooks up with a younger man, Punch, who works in a real estate office. Together they conspire to delay the sale of Leos house by convincing him to sign with the worlds worst realtor, the terminally depressed Sunny Deal. However, Charlotte ends up sleeping with Sunny which knocks her out of her depression and motivates her to make the sale.

Meanwhile, after a nostalgic one-night stand, Ethan has decided he wants to get back together with Leo. Unfortunately, Leo has gotten engaged to a controlling and even emotionally abusive gay Republican Chester Baer and Ethans event planner mother has agreed to plan their commitment ceremony.

In an odd moment, Leo, Punch and Kyle end up in a torrid threesome in Ethans bedroom. Punch decides that Ethan isnt mature enough for him and dumps him. Kyle, whod been considering taking Ethan back, abruptly changes his mind. Chester forgives Leo and they go ahead with their plans.
