The two cops take Ludlow out to the house where the two bodies were found earlier for execution. However, Ludlow manages to kill both of them with a shovel and Demilles Kimber 1911 pistol. He then heads to Washingtons house to take care of their supervisor, Sergeant Mike Clady (Jay Mohr), whom he later captures and places in the trunk of his car.

Ludlow eventually learns that he has been a pawn in a plan masterminded by Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker). Ludlow shows up at Wanders house intending to kill him, when Wander reveals that he has incriminating evidence on just about everybody in the department, as well as judges, councilmen and politicians. With so many people in Wanders pocket, he has been able to quickly move up the departments ranks as well as burying his units corruptions. Wander tries to convince Ludlow that he is his friend and best officer, and tries to bribe him with a large amount of stolen money and incriminating documents hidden in a wall of his home. However, Ludlow shoots and kills Wander.
