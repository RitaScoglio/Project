}} Japanese youth manga of same title. It tells a tale of apathetic school students at a run-down Tokyo high school for boys. It was released on June 29, 2002.  

The film title can be understood as "inexperienced years" or teenage years, but it also can be understood as "fresh start". According to manga artist Taiyō Matsumoto, the title is intended as a play on irony.  

Since its release it has become a cult classic in Japan and overseas. 

==Plot==
At Asashi High, a run-down senior high school for boys, Kujo (Ryuhei Matsuda), Aoki (Hirofumi Arai), Yukio (Sousuke Takaoka), Yoshimura (Shugo Oshinari) and Ota (Yuta Yamazaki) are a gang of school friends lost in apathy and dissatisfaction. They are aware their future offers limited options. Even most teachers have already written them off as a lost cause. 

Kujos gang is part of the schools illegal society, which is controlled through a rooftop game as a test of courage: the Clapping Game. Who wins the game gets to be the societys leader, and rules all gangs throughout Asashi High. No teacher can stand up to this society. 

After a round of the Clapping Game, Kujo wins the leadership, which excites his best friend Aoki, who wants Kujo to dominate the school with punches of casual violence, but Kujo passively resists.  

Aoki eventually realizes his best friend only took part in the Clapping Game to pass the time, and that Kujo never wanted to be the schools leader. Devastated, he challenges Kujo for his leadership, and loses. 

As Aoki becomes disillusioned, alienated and hostile toward Kujo, friends around them slowly fall apart, bringing their school to a series of mini violent climaxes.
