The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is a 1980 comedy film, notable as the final film of Peter Sellers, David Tomlinson and John Le Mesurier. Pre-production began with Richard Quine as director. By the time the film entered production, Piers Haggard had replaced him. Peter Sellers handled the re-shoots himself.  Based on characters created by Sax Rohmer, the film stars Sellers in the dual role of Fu Manchu, a stereotypical Chinese evil genius,    and English country gentleman detective Nayland Smith (he also appears in an uncredited cameo as a Mexican bandito). Released less than a month after his death and despite it being the last film Sellers appeared in while he was alive, the film was a commercial and critical failure. It was also the final film appearance for Tomlinson, who retired shortly before its release and died in 2000.

==Background==
Sellers had previously recorded a 1955 Goon Show entitled The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu-Manchu  set in 1895. In the film his Fu insists friends call him "Fred" and that he had once been the groundsman at Eton College|Eton.
 FBI agent Simon Williams as his bumbling nephew and Helen Mirren as Police Constable Helen Rage (her performance is notable for her singing the Music Hall standard, "Daddy Wouldnt Buy Me a Bow Wow").

Burt Kwouk, Sellers longtime co-star in The Pink Panther films, makes a cameo appearance as a Fu Manchu minion who accidentally destroys the elixir vita, prompting the inside joke that Fu thinks he looks familiar (possibly a veiled reference to Kwouks two uncredited appearances in the "Fu Manchu" films of Christopher Lee). John Le Mesurier has a small part in the film as Nayland-Smiths butler.

Unlike other Fu Manchu works, Fus daughter and Nayland-Smiths friend Dr. Petrie do not appear in the film.

==Plot== elixir vitae (which gives him extended life) after the original is accidentally destroyed by one of Fus minions.

When the diamond "The Star of Leningrad" is stolen by a clockwork spider from a Soviet exhibition in Washington D.C., the F.B.I. sends a pair of special agents to seek the assistance of Scotland Yard as a card from Fu Manchus organisation the Si-Fan has been left at the crime. Sir Roger Avery of the Yard feels this is a job for Fus nemesis, Sir Denis Nayland-Smith, now retired.
 Queen Mary to gain the jewel. He recruits a woman police constable to impersonate the Queen and fool Fus gang. One of the officers, an obese Chinese cuisine loving glutton who has been ordered by the doctor to walk around for five miles a day on stilts, is promised access to Fus outdoor restaurant of Chinese food and helps them steal the diamond. In the finale to the film, Nayland and his fellow officers visit Manchus mountain base in his flying country house, "The Pride of Wiltshire", taking the real diamond with him which Manchu later uses to make himself young and vibrant again, giving them back the other stolen treasures in return.

==Production==
The production of the film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors—Richard Quine and John Avildsen—both fired before the script had been completed.  Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu  with his ill-health often causing delays.  Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggards firing at Sellerss instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences. 

Piers Haggard later recalled:
 It was a very disagreeable experience on that film. I was brought in on an off-chance. He’d agreed to do a fairly stock Hollywood comedy thriller, similar to The Pink Panther really, playing a detective and a villain. And he’d fallen out of love with that project and didn’t want to do that script. They said, ‘Okay, what do you want to do?’ and he said, ‘Let me go off and do a bit of rewriting.’ So he went off with a Hollywood hack and turned it into a series of Goon Show sketches. The executives were absolutely appalled. They thought, ‘Oh my God, we thought he had a picture and now we’ve got a development situation.’ I knew one of them, so they said, ‘Maybe this guy Haggard could do something with this.’ So I got three weeks’ work to supervise a rewrite, which we did. We made Peter’s script much more coherent, turned it into something with a bit more of a beginning, middle and end. And they were very pleased with that so I got the gig. But then unfortunately within about two weeks my love affair with Peter Sellers was over but I had to soldier on. I did soldier on but it was no fun, absolutely no fun. Then just towards the end of the shooting he decided, which had been obvious, that either he would go or I would go so they got rid of me. I didn’t have much choice. So I was retired and he directed for the last week or so. It was pretty much a disaster from beginning to end.   accessed 11 April 2014  

==Reception==
The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu was universally panned by critics.
Phil Hardy described the film as a "British atrocity".    Sellerss ill health and tiredness are clearly visible throughout the film and affected his portrayal of Nayland-Smith, who in comparison to past detectives such as Clouseau, he portrays in a very subdued and quiet fashion. Orange Coast Magazine wrote "Peter Sellers last hurrah isnt nearly as impressive as his recent Being There. Even in the dual roles&nbsp;... detective and the devious 168-year- old Fu Manchu, he musters only an occasional bright moment.   
Tom Shales of The Washington Post described the film as "an indefensibly inept comedy",  adding that "it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. "Manchu" will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as Tell Me Where It Hurts, The Bobo and The Prisoner of Zenda".
