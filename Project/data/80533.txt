 Fortune Bridge, Bay Fortune, Prince Edward Island. The title character is based on the real-life Lydia Dingwell (1852-1931), of Dingwells Mills, Prince Edward Island. The film dramatizes the consequences of spreading lies and rumors, and the horror of rape.  The latter subject had previously been prohibited by the Motion Picture Production Code.  Johnny Belinda is widely considered to be the first Hollywood film for which the restriction was relaxed, and as such was controversial at the time of its initial release.

The film stars Jane Wyman, Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford, Agnes Moorehead, Stephen McNally, and Jan Sterling. Wymans performance earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress.

It was filmed in northern California around Mendocino, California|Mendocino.
 1967 television Richard Thomas as the doctor. Also, a live version aired on Australian television in 1959 as part of the Shell Presents series. 

==Plot summary==
 
 east coast of Canada. The doctor realizes that, although she cannot hear or speak, Belinda is very intelligent. She lives on a farm with her father, Black McDonald (Charles Bickford), and her aunt, Aggie McDonald (Agnes Moorehead), and rarely goes into town. The family sells farm goods to the nearby town, mainly flour. Her father and aunt resent Belinda because her mother died giving birth to her. Dr. Richardson teaches Belinda sign language and what things are. Over time, his affection for her grows. 

Dr. Richardsons secretary, Stella (Jan Sterling), is attracted to him and tries to get his attention, but the doctor does not reciprocate her feelings. After Stella figures out that he is becoming attracted to Belinda, she starts to resent both of them.

One of the familys customers, Locky McCormick (Stephen McNally), gets drunk at a dance, leaves the dance, and goes to the farm when Belinda is alone and rapes her, which results in her pregnancy.  Belinda gives birth to a healthy baby boy, whom she names Johnny.  The people in town began to shun the McDonald family and Dr. Richardson, as they suspect he is the father of Belindas child because he has spent a lot of time with her. Dr. Richardson suggests to Black that he marry Belinda to quiet the gossiping town folk.  Black rejects this idea as he knows that he does not truly love Belinda, but merely pities her.  

Locky goes to the McDonald farm under the pretense of purchasing ground barley, but really wants to get a look at Johnny.  When Black sees him, he orders Locky to leave. Locky inadvertently reveals to Black that he is the father of the child. Black follows Locky and threatens to expose him to the town. They have a fight on a seaside cliff and Locky throws Black off the cliff into the sea, killing him. 

Belinda and her aunt Aggie try to run the farm but they are struggling to pay the bills and keep the farm running. The town, at the urging of Locky, has a meeting and declares Belinda "unfit" to care for the child. When Locky and Stella come to take Johnny, Belinda first makes Stella realize that she is smarter than the townspeople have given her credit for. She also makes it clear that she will not give up her baby without a fight. Stella confronts Locky, who confesses that the child is his. He then tries to retrieve the baby, but, despite Belindas efforts to stop him, he manages to make his way upstairs to the room where Johnny is. However, before Locky can unlock the door, Belinda shoots and kills Locky with a shotgun. Belinda is arrested and goes on trial for murder. At the trial, Dr. Richardson testifies that she was protecting her property and family. The court dismisses this as the doctorâ€™s love for her, but then finally Stella, holding old deep romantic feelings for the doctor, corroborates the doctors story, saying that her husband had confessed the truth about the rape to her on the day he was killed. Belinda is set free, and she, Johnny, and Dr. Richardson leave together.
