}} A Cup of Coffee.  It was Sturges second film as writer-director, after The Great McGinty, and stars Dick Powell and Ellen Drew.

==Plot==
Dr. Maxford (Raymond Walburn) is thoroughly exasperated; he is supposed to announce on nationwide radio the winners of a contest to pick a new slogan for his Maxford House Coffee, with a first prize of $25,000, but his jury is deadlocked by one stubborn man, Mr. Bildocker (William Demarest). As a result, the program ends without an announcement.

One of millions of contestants, office worker Jimmy MacDonald (Dick Powell) dreams of winning, hoping to validate his faith in himself, provide some luxuries for his mother (Georgia Caine), and marry his girlfriend Betty Casey (Ellen Drew). Betty, however, does not understand his slogan: "If you cant sleep at night, its not the coffee, its the bunk."

As a joke, three of his co-workers place a fake telegram on Jimmys desk informing him that he has won.  Jimmys boss, J. B. Baxter (Ernest Truex), is so impressed, he promotes Jimmy on the spot to advertising executive, with his own office, a private secretary (Betty), and a raise. Tom Darcy, one of the pranksters, tries to clear things up before they go too far, but loses his nerve.

When Jimmy arrives to collect the check, Dr. Maxford assumes his committee finally reached a decision without informing him, and presents it to Jimmy. Jimmy and Betty go on a shopping spree at Shindels department store. After telephoning Maxford to confirm the check is good, Mr. Shindel gives Jimmy credit to buy an engagement ring for Betty, a luxury sofa-bed for his mother, and presents for all of their neighbors.

When the truth comes out, Shindel descends on Jimmys street to try to take back his goods, since the check presented to buy the goods was originally considered a bad check. Maxford follows them after and confirms Jimmy did not win. But later Shindel finds out that Maxford did sign the check, so Shindel does not collect the goods, and lets Maxford pay for them. Tom and the other two jokers admit they are to blame.

Late that night, the two go to the office to tell Baxter. Bettys heartfelt plea persuades Baxter to let Jimmy try to prove himself and keep his promotion, although on a very short probationary period and with no raise. Meanwhile, Bildocker bursts into Maxfords office to announce that the other jury members have finally given in and accepted his choice for the grand prize winnerâ€”Jimmy.

==Production== A Cup Universal hired Sturges to direct a film based on the play, but that project fell through when the studio found other work to assign him, including doctoring the script of Diamond Jim. Once that task was completed, Sturges mentor at the studio, producer Henry Henigson, left, leaving nobody at Universal to champion Sturges film. Once Sturges himself moved to Paramount, he made a deal with the studio to buy the script for $6,000. TCM
