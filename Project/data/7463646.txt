==Viral video==
On April 7, 2009, the producers of Royal Kill held an informal press conference with the films director, lead actress, and composer. In addition, two supposed "experts" were present to discuss the Nepalese royal massacre as the basis for the story. When the topic was brought up, a woman in the audience started to berate one of the experts before approaching her and slamming her head into a table. A brief fight ensued before the attacker was pulled away. She then hopped into a waiting car. 

Video of the incident was posted to YouTube and other internet video sites, eventually getting viewed millions of times.  Some suspected that it was staged. 

In fact, both women involved were professional wrestlers hired to do a stunt in hopes of attracting attention to the low-budget film. The attacker was noted wrestler Shelly Martinez. A   later appeared showing the participants rehearsing and discussing the incident.  

==Release==
Royal Kill had a limited release in some AMC Theatres in the United States. It was one of the lowest-budgeted movies ever to play at AMC.   After a successful first week in theaters, Royal Kills theatrical run was extended to a second and then a third week.

==Reception==
The film opened to extremely poor reviews.  Dan Zak of the Washington Post called it "deliriously bad filmmaking" and an "utter failure", writing, "Royal Kill needs to be seen to be believed, but dont see it, under any circumstances".
