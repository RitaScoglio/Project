==Plot== Love Me". Later, back in the room, after making love again, Sailor and Lula finally decide to run away to California, breaking Sailors parole. Marietta arranges for private detective Johnnie Farragut – her on-off boyfriend – to find them and bring them back. Unbeknownst to Farragut, however, Marietta also hires gangster Marcellus Santos to track them, and kill Sailor. Santoss minions capture and kill Farragut, sending Marietta into a guilt-fueled psychosis.

Unaware of all of the events happening back in North Carolina, the two are on their way until – according to Lula – they witness a bad omen: the aftermath of a two-car accident, and the only survivor, a young woman, dies in front of them. With little money left, Sailor heads for Big Tuna, Texas, where he contacts "old friend" Perdita Durango, who might be able to help them, although she secretly knows he is under contract to be killed by Lulas mother. Inevitably, while Sailor agrees to join up with gangster Bobby Peru in a feed store robbery, Lula waits for him in the hotel room, trying to conceal that she is pregnant with Sailors child. While Sailor is out Bobby enters the room, and convinces Lula to implore him to make love with her, but in the end he refuses, stating he has no time.

The robbery goes spectacularly wrong when Peru unnecessarily shoots the two clerks. Peru then admits to Sailor hes been hired to kill him and Sailor realizes he has been given a pistol with dummy ammunition. Chasing Sailor out of the store, Peru is about to kill him when the sheriffs deputies open fire on him and Peru accidentally blows his own head off with his own shotgun. Sailor is arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.

==Production== pilot episode for the successful Twin Peaks television series and tried to rescue two of his projects – Ronnie Rocket and One Saliva Bubble – both involved in contractual complications as a result of Dino De Laurentiis bankruptcy, which had been bought by Carolco Pictures.       Lynch stated, "Ive had a bad time with obstacles . . . It wasnt Dinos fault, but when his company went down the tubes, I got swallowed up in that".  Independent production company Propaganda Films commissioned Lynch to develop an updated noir screenplay based on a 1940s crime novel while Monty Montgomery, a friend of Lynchs and an associate producer on Twin Peaks, asked novelist Barry Gifford what he was working on.  Gifford happened to be writing the manuscript for Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula but still had two more chapters to write.    He let Montgomery read it while the producer was working on the pilot episode for Twin Peaks in pre-published galley form. Montgomery read it and two days later called Gifford and told him that he wanted to make a film of it.  Two days afterwards, Montgomery gave Lynch Gifford’s book while he was editing the pilot, asking him if he would executive produce a film adaptation that he would direct.    Lynch remembers telling him, "That’s great Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?"  Montgomery did not think that Lynch would like the book because he did not think it was his "kind of thing."  Lynch loved the book and called Gifford soon afterwards, asking him if he could make a film of it.  Lynch remembers, "It was just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened."  Lynch was drawn to what he saw as "a really modern romance in a violent world – a picture about finding love in hell," and was also attracted to "a certain amount of fear in the picture, as well as things to dream about. So it seems truthful in some way." 
 The Wizard of Oz (1939) began to influence the script he was writing and he included a reference to the "yellow brick road".    Lynch remembers, "It was an awful tough world and there was something about Sailor being a rebel. But a rebel with a dream of the Wizard of Oz is kinda like a beautiful thing".  Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. read an early draft of the screenplay and did not like Gifford’s ending either, so Lynch changed it. However, the director was worried that this change made the film too commercial, "much more commercial to make a happy ending yet, if I had not changed it, so that people wouldn’t say I was trying to be commercial, I would have been untrue to what the material was saying". 
 Las Vegas in order to bond and get a handle on their characters.  Dern remembers, "We agreed that Sailor and Lula needed to be one person, one character, and we would each share it. I got the sexual, wild, Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn, gum-chewing fantasy, female side; Nick’s got the snakeskin, Elvis Presley|Elvis, raw, combustible, masculine side".  Within four months, Lynch began filming on August 9, 1989 in both Los Angeles (including the San Fernando Valley) and New Orleans with a relatively modest budget of $10 million.  Originally, the film featured more explicit erotic scenes between Sailor and Lula. In one, she has an orgasm while relating to Sailor a dream she had of being ripped open by a wild animal. Another deleted scene had Lula lowering herself onto Sailors face saying, "Take a bite out of Lula". 

==Themes==
 
One of the films themes is, according to Lynch, "finding love in Hell". He has stated "For me, its just a compilation of ideas that come along. The darker ones and the lighter ones, the humorous ones, all working together. You try to be as true as you can to those ideas and try to get them on film."  Some critics have postulated that, similar to Lynchs previous Blue Velvet, the sudden idealistic ending of perfect happiness is ironic, suggesting that people who have the potential for violence struggle to find true happiness.    Lynch himself, however, refers to the ending of Wild at Heart as being a "happy" one, having consciously made the decision to change the original darker ending from the novel.

===Distribution===
Early test screenings for Wild at Heart did not go well, with the strong violence in some scenes being too much. At the first test screening, eighty people walked out during a graphic torture scene involving Johnnie Farragut.  Lynch decided not to cut anything from the film and at the second screening one hundred people walked out during this scene. Lynch remembers, "By then, I knew the scene was killing the film. So I cut it to the degree that it was powerful but didnt send people running from the theatre".  In retrospect, the filmmaker said, "But that was part of what Wild at Heart was about: really insane and sick and twisted stuff going on." 

The film was completed one day before it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium. After the screening, it received "wild cheering" from the audience.    When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced Wild at Heart as the Palme dOr winner at the awards ceremony,  the boos almost drowned out the cheers with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors.   Barry Gifford remembers that there was a prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail. "All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like ‘This is nothing like the book’ or ‘He ruined my book.’ I think everybody from Time (magazine)|Time magazine to What’s On In London was disappointed when I said ‘This is fantastic. This is wonderful. It’s like a big, dark, musical comedy’". 

====MPAA Rating====
The MPAA told Lynch that the version of Wild at Heart screened at Cannes would receive an X rating in North America unless cuts were made, as the NC-17 was not in effect in 1990, at the time of the films release.  The director was contractually obligated to deliver an R-rated film.  He made one change in the scene where a character shoots his own head off with a shotgun. Gun smoke was added to tone down the blood and hide the removal of the characters head from his body. Foreign prints were not affected.  The Region 1 DVD and Blu-rays contain the toned-down version of the shotgun scene.

===Box office===
Wild at Heart opened in the United States on August 17, 1990 in a limited release of only 532 theaters, grossing  2,913,764 in its opening weekend.  It went into wide release on August 31 with 618 theaters and grossing an additional $1,858,379. The film ultimately grossed $14,560,247 in North America.   

===Reception===
  at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.]]
The film has a rating of 64% on Rotten Tomatoes  and a 52 metascore at Metacritic.  It received mixed to negative reviews upon its initial theatrical release.

Roger Ebert wrote in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, "He is a good director, yes. If he ever goes ahead and makes a film about whats really on his mind, instead of hiding behind sophomoric humor and the cop-out of parody, he may realize the early promise of his Eraserhead. But he likes the box office prizes that go along with his pop satires, so he makes dishonest movies like this one".  USA Today gave the film one and a half stars out of four and said, "This attempt at a one-up also trumpets its weirdness, but this time the agenda seems forced".  

In his review for Sight & Sound magazine, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, "Perhaps the major problem is that despite Cage and Derns best efforts, Lynch is ultimately interested only in iconography, not characters at all. When it comes to images of evil, corruption, derangement, raw passion and mutilation (roughly in that order), Wild at Heart is a veritable cornucopia".  Richard Combs in his review for Time (magazine)|Time wrote, "The result is a pile-up, of innocence, of evil, even of actual road accidents, without a context to give significance to the casualties or survivors".  Christopher Sharrett in Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste magazine wrote, "Lynchs characters are now so cartoony one is prone to address him more as a theorist than director, except he is not that challenging ... One is never sure what Lynch likes or dislikes, and his often striking images are too often lacking in compassion for us to accept him as a chronicler of a moribund landscape a la Fellini".  However, Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine, "Starting with the outrageous and building from there, he ignites a slight love-on-the-run novel, creating a bonfire of a movie that confirms his reputation as the most exciting and innovative filmmaker of his generation".
