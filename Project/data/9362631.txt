==Plot== Triad member Brother Smartie, who wants a game of dice.  Kung easily loses $1 million, as well as $5000 to Gigi, and he relies on his "winnings" in order to pay it all back.  When he finally discovers he never won the lottery (much to his shock and dismay), he decides to fake being mentally retarded, a feat which he pulls off quite well.  Then he learns he gains more benefits that way, so he chooses to remain mentally ill for the time being.  However, he has to learn the true meaning of life and to take what life has to offer but not ask for more.
