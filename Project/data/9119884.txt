 1900 UK|British short  silent comedy George Albert Smith, featuring an elderly gentleman getting a glimpse of a womans ankle through a telescope. The three-shot comedy, according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, "uses a similar technique to that which G.A. Smith pioneered in Grandmas Reading Glass (1900)," and although, "the editing is unsophisticated, the film does at least show a very early example of how to make use of point-of-view close-ups in the context of a coherent narrative (which is this films main advance on Grandmas Reading Glass)." "Smiths experiments with editing," Brooke concludes, "were ahead of most contemporary film-makers, and in retrospect it can clearly be seen that he was laying the foundations of film grammar as we now understand it."      

==Production==
The film was shot in Furze Hill, Hove, England outside the entrance to St. Anns Well Gardens, Hove|St. Anns Well Gardens, where Smith had his studio.

==Synopsis==
An old gentleman is shown on a village street, looking for something through a field glass. Suddenly, he levels the glass on a young couple coming up the road. The girls shoe string came loose, and her companion volunteers to tie it. Here the scene changes, showing how it looks through the old mans glass. A very pretty ankle at short range. Scene changes back again and shows the old fellow tickled to death over the sight. The couple, who, by the way, caught "Peeping Tom," come toward him, and as the young man passes behind him, he knocks off his hat and kicks the stool on which he is sitting, from under him, making the old chap present a rather ludicrous appearance, as he sits in the street
