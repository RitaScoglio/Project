The film also stars Hubert Koundé, Danny Huston, Bill Nighy and Donald Sumpter. It was filmed on location in Loiyangalani and the slums of Kibera, a section of Nairobi, Kenya. Circumstances in the area affected the cast and crew to the extent that they set up the Constant Gardener Trust in order to provide basic education for these villages. The plot was vaguely based on a Medical experimentation in Africa#Meningitis testing in Kano.2C Nigeria|real-life case in Kano, Nigeria. The DVD versions were released in the United States on 1 January 2006 and in the United Kingdom on 13 March 2006. Justins gentle but diligent attention to his plants is a recurring background theme, from which image the films title is derived.

==Plot==
Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a shy low-level British diplomat and horticultural hobbyist posted in Kenya, is one to avoid making a fuss until he learns that his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) was found dead on the veld. Tessa has been murdered at a crossroads along with her Kenyan driver. Her doctor colleague Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Koundé) is initially suspected of her murder but is later found to have been murdered on the same day as Tessa. Various rumours abound that the two were having an affair; however, it is later revealed that Bluhm was gay.
 Amnesty activist. He falls in love with her and she persuades him to take her back with him to Kenya. Despite their loving marriage, Tessa keeps from Justin the reason why she approached him in the first place - to investigate a suspicious drug trial in Kenya and expose it. When Tessa starts getting too close to uncovering the malpractices of an influential and powerful pharmaceutical company, she and her colleague are brutally murdered.

As the mystery surrounding his wifes death unfolds, Justin becomes determined to get to the bottom of her murder. He soon runs up against a drug corporation that is using Kenyas population for fraudulent testing of a tuberculosis drug ("List of fictional medicines and drugs|dypraxa") with known harmful side effects that disregards the well-being of its poor African test subjects.

Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) is the head of the Africa Desk at the Foreign Office and he is Justins and Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston), the British High Commissioners boss. In his investigations, Justin discovers that Tessa hid from him a report about the deaths caused by dypraxa, and obtains an incriminating letter that Tessa took from Sandy. 

Justin confronts Sandy, who tells Justin that what Tessa wanted was to stop the dypraxa tests and redesign the drug. However, this would have cost millions of dollars and significantly delay the drug during which time other competing drugs would surface. Pellegrin considered Tessas report too damaging, and decided she had to be stopped. 

The company threatens Justin to stop his investigations or else join his wife, sending agents to beat him in one instance. Still determined, Justin takes a UN aid plane to the village where the doctor that provided Tessa with the clinical data backing her report resides. The doctor gives him a copy of the report. However, the village is raided by armed tribesmen on horseback and they are forced to flee amongst the carnage to the plane. 

Justin has the plane drop him off at the place where Tessa died. There Justin dwells upon Tessa. He tells her memory that he knows all her secrets, that he understands her now, and that he is coming home. Shortly after, he is killed in an organised hit.

At Tessas and Justins funeral, Arthur Hammond (Tessas close cousin and Justins friend) reads the incriminating letter written by Bernard Pellegrin to Sandy Woodrow. Within the letter, Pelligrin ordered the surveillance of Tessa expressly to block her reports detailing the deaths caused by dypraxa. The company could not be held responsible for the dypraxa deaths if they never officially received the reports. The scandal having been revealed, Pellegrin leaves the funeral followed by journalists.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The films worldwide gross was US$82,466,670. 

===Critical response=== Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice criticized the film as "a cannonballing mélange of hack-cuts, impressionistic close-ups, and tropical swelter."  Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said the film diminishes "the real urgency of the Wests humanitarian disconnect from Africa. If it sends audiences home to log on to the Amnesty International website, terrific – but that still doesnt make it a very good movie." 

===Awards===
The film was nominated for four   Awards: Best Motion Picture (Drama), and Best Director. Additionally, Weisz won the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role.

==Authors dedication and afterword==
John le Carré, in his original novel, provided a dedication and also a personal afterword. Both the dedication and part of the afterword (amended) are reproduced in the closing credits of the film. The first states: "This film is dedicated to Yvette Pierpaoli and all other aid workers who lived and died giving a damn". The latter continues (in the next credit): "Nobody in this story, and no outfit or corporation, thank God, is based upon an actual person or outfit in the real world, but I can tell you this, as my journey through the pharmaceutical jungle progressed, I came to realize that, by comparison with the reality, my story was as tame as a holiday postcard". The text appears over John  le Carrés name.
