The film was Parkers feature-length directorial debut, introduced actor Scott Baio, and featured veteran actress (at age 13) Jodie Foster.

==Plot==
A mobster named Roxy Robinson is "splurged" by members of a gang, using rapid-fire custard-shooting "splurge guns." Once splurged, a kid is "all washed up" - "finished." Speakeasy boss Fat Sam introduces himself and Bugsy Malone, a boxing promoter with no money ("Bugsy Malone").

At Fat Sams speakeasy, there is much dancing and singing ("Fat Sams Grand Slam"), but Fat Sam himself is worried that his rival Dandy Dan will come to the speakeasy and try to take over. Blousey Brown, an aspiring singer, has come for an audition, but Sam is too distracted. Bugsy meets Blousey when he trips over her luggage. He is smitten and flirts with her. Suddenly, Fat Sams is raided by Dandy Dans men, who shoot the place up. Dandy Dans men continue to attack Fat Sams empire, eventually taking away rackets and splurging all of Fat Sams gang except Knuckles. Fat Sam sends all his available men to see if they can track down the guns. They are trapped at a laundry and all are splurged by Dandy Dans gang. Bugsy returns to Fat Sams to try to arrange a new audition for Blousey. He finds only Fat Sams girlfriend, Tallulah, the chanteuse of the speakeasy, who tells him that she likes him. Although Bugsy rejects her flirtation, when Blousey enters, Tallulah plants a big kiss on Bugsys forehead, making Blousey jealous. Blousey has her audition and Fat Sam hires her, but she still refuses to speak to Bugsy ("Im Feelin Fine").

Fat Sam hires Bugsy to come along to a meeting with Dandy Dan. This meeting turns out to be a trap, but Bugsy helps Fat Sam escape. Gratefully, Fat Sam pays him $200. Bugsy and Blousey reconcile and have a lunch and a romantic outing on a lake. Back in the city, Bugsy promises to buy tickets for them to leave for Hollywood. However, when he returns Sams car to the garage, he is attacked and his money stolen. Bugsy is saved by Leroy Smith, who punches the attackers: seeing this, Bugsy realizes he has found a potentially great boxer. Bugsy introduces Leroy to Cagey Joe and helps him begin training ("So You Wanna Be a Boxer?"). Fat Sam once again enlists Bugsys aid after his assistant Knuckles is unintentionally killed. Bugsy declines, but when Fat Sam pays him $400 he sees another chance to fulfill his promise to Blousey, so he agrees to help Fat Sam. However, when Blousey finds out that Bugsy hasnt yet bought the tickets, she is left in a state of disappointment ("Ordinary Fool"). Bugsy and Leroy follow Dandy Dans men to a warehouse, where they discover the guns are being stashed. The two of them cant take the place alone, so Bugsy enlists the aid of a large group of down-and-out workers at a soup kitchen ("Down and Out").

They steal the crates of guns and return with them to Fat Sams just as Dandy Dans gang arrives. Chaos breaks out and everyone is covered in a melee of custard. A pie hits the piano player Razmataz, who falls forward, striking a single bass note with his head. Silence instantly breaks out, and then the crowd, now covered in white cream (with the sole exceptions of Bugsy and Blousey), engages in a final number ("You Give a Little Love"). They realize they can all be friends, and Bugsy and Blousey leave for Hollywood.

==Production==
Bugsy Malone was Alan Parkers first feature film. Parker was trying to find a film that his children would enjoy, and his eldest son suggested one featuring a cast of only children. 
===Casting===
The director chose to cast several unknown actors in the film. To find his Fat Sam, Parker visited a Brooklyn classroom, asking for "the naughtiest boy in class". They were unanimous in selecting John Cassisi, and Parker gave him the role. Actress Florrie Dugger was originally cast in a smaller role; when the actress cast as Blousey suddenly grew taller than Baio, Dugger was promoted. At the time they filmed, all of the cast were under 17 years old.   IMDB.  Retrieved 3 June 2010. 

Parker cast  Baio after he slammed down the script and stormed out of his audition. Baio later remembered:
 I had quit the business, because I didn’t like driving into Manhattan. Well, the long and the short of it is that I wanted to play with my friends after school, but it happened to be raining that day, so I went to the city to meet with Alan Parker. I read it, but I just barely read it. I didn’t even want to be there. He was English, but I didn’t even know what that was. He was just this weird guy with long hair, and I didn’t know what he was.   So I sort of read the script, threw it at him, and walked out the door. That was it: I’d gotten the part before I got home.   accessed 7 April 2014  
===Music=== Paul Williams Oscar for Evergreen from A Star Is Born. (He would also go on to become very well known for his work in childrens films, such as The Rainbow Connection from his score for The Muppet Movie).

Williams felt that "...the challenge for me was to provide songs that reflected the period ... and yet maintained an energy that would hold the young audiences attention." According to Parker, Williams was writing while on tour, recording songs in different cities, and sending the completed tapes to Hollywood. Arriving during pre-shoot rehearsals, the songs had to be accepted and used as they were, with voices by Paul, Archie Hahn and others.

Neither the director nor the songwriter was entirely comfortable with the results. Williams later wrote "Im really proud of the work and the only thing Ive ever doubted is the choice of using adult voices. Perhaps I should have given the kids a chance to sing the songs." Parker also commented: "Watching the film after all these years, this is one aspect that I find the most bizarre. Adult voices coming out of these kids mouths? I had told Paul that I didnt want squeaky kids voices and he interpreted this in his own way. Anyway, as the tapes arrived, scarcely weeks away from filming, we had no choice but to go along with it!"   PaulWilliamsCoUK.plus.com; David Chamberlayne. Retrieved 3 June 2010. 

===Filming=== Black Park Country Park (Wexham, Buckinghamshire) and Reading, Berkshire.
 fast cut to a victim being pelted with "splurge" was used to convey the impression of the rapid-firing guns. 

Baio later said making the film was "awesome":
 A kid’s fantasy: You get to dress up as gangster, you get to shoot guns that fire whipped cream, you get to drive cars with pedals that look like real cars, and you get to talk like a grown-up. I mean, you couldn’t ask for a better first big gig. Talk about getting you hooked on a business! It was fantastic.
