Joey suddenly comes to the attention of Vincents current girlfriend, Michelle (Frances McDormand), who was unaware that he even had a son, and she can not understand why Vincent is unwilling to help him.

As his fellow police officers search for Joey as a suspected "cop killer," Vincent decides to set aside his self-imposed isolation, and to help save his sons life.

Although the story is mostly set in the New York City oceanfront suburb of Long Beach, New York, on Long Island, whose municipal slogan actually is Civitas Ad Mare - Latin for "The City by the Sea"—actual location filming was done in Asbury Park, New Jersey.
