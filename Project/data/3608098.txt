==Plot==

The haikara of the title is Benio Hanamura (voiced by:  ), who is much more feminine than Benio but equally interested in  ), a young man who was raised to play female roles in the kabuki theater and as a result has acquired very effeminate mannerisms.
 German ancestry) wishes to fulfill the dream of his grandmother, who once fell in love with a man of the Hanamura family but was unable to marry him because of the difference in their social standings.  In keeping with her feminist ideals, Benio flatly refuses and even attempts to elope with Ranmaru, but is caught when she become involved in a brawl at a local tavern.  Since Benios friend Tamaki is in love with Shinobu, Benio also wants out of the engagement to avoid hurting Tamaki. Benio finally agrees to move into Shinobus household to learn how to be a good wife, according to Japanese custom.

Initially, Benios plan is to purposely err in her wifely duties in every way imaginable, from cooking badly to embarrassing her fiance in public, in the hopes that his family will cancel the engagement.  Benio frequently argues with Shinobus grandfather and is a constant irritant to the familys strict governmess.  Ranmaru even moves into the Ijuin house and poses as Benios personal maid.  However, her scheme fails - Shinobu genuinely loves Benio and patiently forgives her for her many blunders, and Benio soon realizes that in spite of herself, she is also falling in love with him.  However, a major in the army who holds a grudge against Shinobu then sends the young lieutenant to fight in Manchuria.

Benio stays on in the Ijuin home to care for Shinobus grandparents and wait for his return.  She cuts her waist-length hair short and decides to get a job to help out with the familys dire financial situation.  After a failed try as a geisha, Benio becomes a reporter for a small local newspaper and convinces her misogynistic boss, Tosei (who is allergic to women because of his hatred of his mother, but somehow appears to be immune to Benio), to send her to Manchuria to cover the war.  Once in China, she learns that Shinobu is missing in action and feared dead.  Heartbroken, Benio attempts suicide (by trying to drown herself first in a bowl of water, and then in a jar of sake, which only results in her getting drunk), but is convinced to return to Japan and move on with her life.
 repossessed - until a mysterious good Samaritan steps in to pay the mortgage on the mansion.  The mystery benefactor is in fact Benios boss, Tosei.  Moved by this unexpected show of kindness, Benio decides to forget Shinobu and accept Toseis proposal of marriage.  Meanwhile, Benios friend Tamaki has fallen for Onijima, although the two try to deny their feelings since they are from different social classes.

Everything appears to be set in stone, until Benio and Toseis wedding day, when the Kanto earthquake of 1923 rocks Tokyo and forces a bittersweet ending to the story.  Lalissa is fatally injured in the quake trying to save Shinobu, and as she lies dying, she tells Shinobu to marry Benio and be happy.  Shinobu, memories restored and himself severely injured, finds Benio amid the wreckage of the ruined city, and the two vow to never be separated from each other again.  Tosei tries to save Benio, but Benio refuses, preferring to die alongside her beloved rather than face life without him; thus, Tosei rescues both Benio and Shinobu.  In the end, Tosei comes to terms with his feelings about his mother and rededicates himself to his business; Onijima returns to Manchuria, and Tamaki decides to obey her heart and follow him; and Benio and Shinobu are wed at last.

==Distribution==
 terrestrial TV Asahi network from June 1978 to March 1979, spanned 42 episodes, was directed by Kazuyoshi Yokota (Spaceship Sagittarius, Grimms Fairy Tale Classics, My Daddy-Long-Legs), and featured character designs by future Ranma 1/2 director Tsutomu Shibayama.

Due to disappointing ratings, Nippon Animation was forced to end the series early and craft an ending to the anime that was different from that of the manga, cutting the story off after the arrival of Shinobu and Lalissa in Japan. In the final episode, Benio is told that the mysterious Russian count is not Shinobu (Lalissa has a photograph of their wedding day to prove it). However, an epilogue narration reveals that Lalissa found Shinobu in Siberia. He was severely hurt, and was the spitting image of her late husband. The final episode concludes with Benio finally being reunited with Shinobu. Up until this point, the anime had been a very faithful adaptation of the manga, even incorporating redrawn stills from Yamatos original work (although the anime portrayed Benio with reddish-brown hair, and Yamatos colorized drawings often showed her as blonde).

The anime has been discovered by new audiences in the years since thanks to the enduring popularity of the original manga (as well as a live-action movie version of the story released in Japan in 1987).  In 2005, Haikara-san ga Tooru was listed at #95 in a TV Asahi poll of the top 100 animation series of all time, based on a nationwide survey of Japanese of all age groups.  The anime has also been aired across Japan by the anime satellite television network, Animax, and the NHK satellite channel NHK BS2|BS2.
 French dub English title for the anime is Smart-san.
