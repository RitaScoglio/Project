He refuses her company, insisting that she killed her mother Morella (Leona Gage) in childbirth. Lenora then discovers her mothers body decomposing on a bed in the house. Lenora cannot return to Boston and remains in the house to care for her father. His feelings soften towards her when he learns she has a terminal illness. One night Morellas spirit rises, and kills Lenora in revenge for her childbed death. Morellas body is then resurrected, becoming as whole and as beautiful as she was in life. This is in exchange for Lenoras, which is now decomposing where Morella lay. Morella strangles her horrified husband as a fire breaks out in the house. Then Morella and Lenora return to their original bodies, Lenora smiling as she lies on her dead father, rotten Morella cackling as the flames consume the house.

Months pass and Valdemars putrefying body remains in his bed under the complete control of Carmichael. The hypnotist tries to force Valdemars wife Helene (Debra Paget) to marry him.

==Production==
The film was announced in September 1961. FILMLAND EVENTS: Poe-Pourri Film Cooks for Corman
Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File)   07 Sep 1961: B9. 

Corman commented on how Tales of Terror differed from his earlier film adaptations released by AIP: 
:With Tales of Terror, we tried to do something a little different. The screenplay was actually a series of very frightening, dramatic sequences inspired by several of the Poe stories. To break things up, we tried introducing humor into one of them..."
 House of Usher. 

Price explained how the effect of slow decomposition was achieved in "The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar": "We settled for an old-fashioned mud pack - it dries and draws the skin up and then cracks open." To give the impression of Vincent Prices face melting away, a mixture of glue, glycerin, corn starch and make-up paint was heated and then poured over his head. The substance was so hot that Price could only stand it for a few seconds. 

Richard Mathesons favourite of the stories was the final one, M. Valdemar. He thought it was "pretty well done. It was pretty straight, except I added the doctor and Valdemars wife to the story... They acted it pretty well for a change." Lawrence French, "The Making of The Raven", The Raven novelisation by Eunice Sudak, based on script by Richard Matheson, Bear Manor Media 2012 

==Reception==
