==Plot==
Nine-year-old Evelyn Doyles (Sophie Vavasseur) mother has abandoned the family, leaving her out-of-work father Desmond Doyle (Pierce Brosnan) to bring up Evelyn and her two brothers, Maurice (Hugh MacDonagh) and Dermot (Niall Beagan) on his own. Matters are only made worse when Desmonds mother-in-law (Claire Mullan) reports the abandonment of the children to the authorities. Irish law prohibits children from being brought up in a "broken home", and therefore places these children in Catholic Church|Church-run Industrial school|orphanages. Desmond also drinks excessively.

Vowing to reunite his family, Desmond enlists the help of his friends: barmaid Bernadette Beattie (Julianna Margulies), her solicitor brother Michael (Stephen Rea), their American lawyer friend Nick Barron (Aidan Quinn) and his old mentor, Thomas Connolly (Alan Bates). Together, the group attempts to do what has never been done before - challenge a law before the Irish Supreme Court by overturning some provisions of the Irish Children Act, 1941.
