 horror short film written, directed and produced by Sam Raimi. Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film Clockwork (film)|Clockwork, deciding to produce a "prototype" horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his friends Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as the two protagonists and produced the film for United states dollar|$1600. Shot on location in a remote cabin in the woods, production was a difficult process because of the low budget. Several of the special effects presented in the film were done in a severely low budget manner, some of which were improvised on set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods.

Raimi convinced a local theater manager to screen the film alongside The Rocky Horror Picture Show which sparked minor interest. Initially a meager success, the film screened well to test audiences and inspired a larger budget remake directed by Raimi, called The Evil Dead (1981). The film was the first in the The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead franchise, and launched the careers of both Campbell and Raimi. Several of the aesthetic qualities found in Within the Woods later defined Raimis films.

==Plot==
 Monopoly to Indian burial ground. Ellen is concerned, but Bruce assures her that they will be fine as long as they dont disturb the graves of the dead.  Bruce then explores the area and discovers an ancient dagger belonging to the Indians.  Ignoring his own advice, he takes the dagger with him.

After lunch, Ellen takes a nap.  When she awakes, she finds Bruce missing and wanders into the woods looking for him.  To her horror, she finds Bruces dead body, horribly mutilated with apparent knife wounds.  She is then startled by the presence of an demonic entity hiding within the woods, and quickly runs back to the cabin. While fleeing, she is attacked by unseen forces. She runs back to the cabin and screams to be let in immediately, being let in just as the entity is approaching her. Ellen tells her friends that Bruce has been murdered, but Scotty dismisses the whole thing as a joke and goes to find Bruce. Shelly - Scottys girlfriend -, and Ellen are concerned when Scotty doesnt return right away. Shelly walks outside to begin a search for the missing men, but a possessed Bruce assaults and strangles her, eventually stabbing her in the neck and killing her with the dagger that he found, moaning "join us."

Ellen encounters her possessed friend and flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts to enter the room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruces hand several times in the process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking down the stairs to the cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.

Ellen attempts to flee but is severely beaten by the possessed Bruce, who throws her around the cabin. While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruces mutilated hand which is still holding the dagger found from before, and she uses it to stab Bruce. A large amount of blood is expended by Bruce, who lies motionless for a moment, only to then continue his assault on Ellen. Ellen mutilates Bruces body even further with an axe, chopping off nearly every limb from the writhing body. Severely disturbed by the things she has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth muttering to herself. The corpse of Scotty unexpectedly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving the fate of Ellen ambiguous.

===Background===
  Winston Dixon Egan (2011), Campbell (2002), p. 65 
 Campbell (2002), Lamberson (2008), Becker (2002), p. 64 

The prototype film was called Within the Woods. In addition to Raimis interest in various horror films, one of the main inspirations came in the writing of H. P. Lovecraft, who introduced the concept of the "book of the dead" to Raimi.  Raimi studied the concept of magical books, in particular the Necronomicon, which formed the basis of the film. Campbell described the film as a combination of "creative writing and ancient history".  In order to flesh out of the idea, Raimi came up with a concept where a group of teenagers went into the woods and were attacked by demonic spirits, summoned by the disturbance of an Indian burial ground.  The book of the dead concept was not present in the finished film, but appeared extensively in later films by Raimi. 

===Filming===
  Campbell (2002), Campbell (2002), p. 70 

The effects of the film were entirely low-budget. Nearly every effect in the film was done via things picked up at a make-up and Halloween store located close to where the film was shot.  The effects in the film were notably more intricate than the simple ones featured in Raimis prior projects, and contained mutilated bodies, stabbed body parts and demonic possession skin-attachments.  Tom Sullivan was one of the primary make-up supervisors on set, and he found it difficult working presentable effects out of such low budgets. One notable example involved a chest stabbing rig that had to be attached to Spiegels chest by straps and duct tape. 
 Campbell (2002), pp.&nbsp;71–72  Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with "bizarre" ideas while shooting scenes. This lead to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, "taking it a little further than we had gone before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect. 

===Post-production===
 
 Campbell (2002), p. 74  Though the request was "obscure" in nature, a company in San Francisco managed to accommodate the task with little difficulty.  Upon testing how the footage looked at a local movie theater, it came out mostly acceptable, until further tests led to the footage appearing grainy and difficult to make out. 

==Distribution and reception== Campbell (2002), p. 81  Eventually, Raimi got in contact with a manager at a movie theater in Detroit who was "open and flexible". The same theater played The Rocky Horror Picture Show every single week and was open to more unusual cinema. To Raimis shock, the manager agreed to screen Within the Woods right before a midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  The premiere of the film received a positive reception by the audience, and the cast and crew was paid just over $10, all of which was donated to the American Cancer Society.  The film, however, was never commercially released.

==Aftermath==
 
 Konow (2012), Campbell (2002), pp.&nbsp;86–88  
  film franchise Campbell (2002), Campbell (2002), pp.&nbsp;104–105  Other elements, such as graphic imagery, bleak endings, and mutilations, defined many of Raimis other films.  Raimi has put Campbell in cameo roles in all three of Raimis Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man trilogy, as well as several other films.  
 Eddie (2010), p. 15  The Coen brothers served as editors for The Evil Dead, and developed a friendship with Raimi.  The duo have cast Campbell in some of their films such as The Hudsucker Proxy (1994) and Fargo (film)|Fargo (1996), the former of which was co-written by Raimi.
