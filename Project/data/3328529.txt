}} 1988 romantic comedy film, starring Richard Dreyfuss, Raúl Juliá and Sonia Braga. It is a remake of the 1939 film The Magnificent Fraud, based on the unpublished short story entitled Caviar for His Excellency by Charles G. Booth.

==Plot== Parador when Paradorian President Alfonse Simms suddenly dies of a heart attack. Not wanting to lose his position in power, the presidents right-hand man, Roberto Strausmann (Juliá) forces Jack to take the role of a lifetime - that of the dead president, as the two men look so much alike. Jack accepts, eventually winning over the people and even the dead presidents mistress, Madonna (Braga). However, when paradise proves to be too boring, Jack needs to find a way to get out while keeping Roberto out of the loop.

==Production==
In the beginning, while both the President and Jack are in the scene, the President is played by Dreyfuss older brother Lorin.
 The Impossible Dream" from Man of La Mancha. Sammy Davis Jr.s rendition of Paradors national anthem is sung against the music for "Bésame Mucho". The previous Paradorian National Anthem ("O Parador") is sung to the tune of "O Christmas Tree".
