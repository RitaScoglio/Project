Captain Hugh "Bullshot" Crummond (Alan Shearman) is a World War I fighter pilot, Olympic athlete, racing driver, and part-time sleuth. He must save the world from the dastardly Count Otto van Bruno (Ronald E. House), his wartime adversary, and win the heart of the damsel in distress (Diz White).

The film was produced by George Harrisons company Handmade Films.

Alan Shearman would reprise his association with Handmade Films in their 1985 film Water (1985 film)|Water.
