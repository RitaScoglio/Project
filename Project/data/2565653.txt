Bright Leaves is a 2003 documentary film by independent filmmaker Ross McElwee about the association his family had with the tobacco industry.
 1950 feature film about a struggle between two tobacco barons. (Patricia Neal, one of the films stars, is interviewed.)

The struggle depicted in the film, according to McElwee family tradition, parallels the historical one between McElwees great-grandfather and the patriarch of the Duke family who founded Duke University.   

The documentary follows McElwees usual style, where he gives voiceovers to apparently spontaneous footage, making the story more personal.
