 British film Philip Davis and starring Reece Dinsdale, Sean Pertwee and Warren Clarke. It is set in the 1980s, in England, mainly London, and also shot at Millmoor and Valley Parade football grounds in Rotherham and Bradford respectively. The tagline is "When you go undercover, remember one thing... Who you are."

==Plot==
John (Reece Dinsdale) an ambitious young police officer, is sent undercover into the hardcore football gangs to track down the generals - the shadowy figures who orchestrate the violence. His team of four gradually ingratiates itself into the lives of The Dogs, the nickname that Shadwells fans give themselves.  The main site for this is The Rock, a public house around which The Dogs lives revolve.  Gradually, the hard drinking, hard fighting macho world - where Saturdays match and Saturdays rumble are all that matters - proves irresistible and John slowly finds himself turning into one of the thugs he has been sent to entrap.

His relationships with his wife, his superiors and even his team become strained, and eventually his wife returns to her parents house and rebuffs his attempted reconciliation.

The operation is abruptly wound up just as it seems John is making progress in identifying those who pull the strings, and the closing sequence shows a shaven-headed John taking part in a racist march.  One of his team approaches him to try help him, but is rebuffed, John saying that he is, again, working undercover.  There is a degree of ambiguity, and it might be that he is working undercover, though it may also be that he has become deluded and has merely mired himself in an even less pleasant world.  His fascist chanting at the very end makes it clear that whatever the truth, John is unable to prevent himself from sinking into his character with trace 
 Shadwell Town Wapping FC. The locations the teams are based on are real â€“ they are neighbouring areas on the north bank of the River Thames, in Londons East End.  It is believed that Millwall F.C is the inspiration for the team, as the clubs fans were infamously violent in the period which the film seems to represent.

A sequel, with the working title of ID2, is due to go into production at the beginning of 2015. It will be directed by Joel Novoa, and is again written by Vincent OConnell.
