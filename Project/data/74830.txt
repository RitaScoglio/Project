==Plot==
 
A young woman named Chrissie Watkins leaves an evening beach party on New Englands Amity Island to go skinny dipping, only to be dragged back and forth and then pulled under the water by an unseen force. Amitys police chief, Martin Brody, is notified that Chrissie is missing, and Deputy Hendricks finds her remains on the beach. The medical examiner informs Brody that she was killed by a shark. Brody plans to close the beaches but is overruled by Mayor Larry Vaughan, who fears that reports of a shark attack will ruin the summer tourist season, the towns primary source of income and notes that the town has never had shark problems. The medical examiner consequently attributes the death to a boating accident. Brody reluctantly goes along with the explanation.

A short time later, a boy named Alex Kintner is killed by a shark at the beach. The boys mother places a bounty on the shark, sparking an amateur shark-hunting frenzy and prompting local professional shark hunter Quint to offer his services for an even higher fee. Marine biologist Matt Hooper examines Chrissies remains and determines that she was unquestionably killed by a shark.

A practical joke by kids causes panic at the main beach while the shark enters a nearby estuary, killing a man; Brodys son, who witnesses the attack, goes into shock. Brody persuades Vaughan to hire Quint, who reluctantly allows Hooper to join the hunt along with Brody. The three set out to catch and kill the shark aboard Quints vessel, the Orca.

However, the shark takes him by surprise, and Hooper drops his spear but manages to escape and hide on the seabed. As Quint and Brody raise the mangled cage, the shark leaps onto the boat, crushing the Transom (nautical)|transom. Quint slips down the deck into the sharks mouth and is devoured. When the shark attacks Brody, he shoves a pressurized scuba tank into its mouth, then takes Quints rifle and climbs the sinking Orca s mast. Brody shoots at the scuba tank, blowing it and the shark to pieces which sinks to the bottom of the sea. Hooper emerges, and the two make rafts out of the Orca s remains to paddle back to the shores of Amity Island.
 

==Production==

===Development=== David Brown, producers at Universal Pictures, independently heard about Peter Benchleys novel Jaws (novel)|Jaws. Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazines book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment "might make a good movie".     The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished.    They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the books publication, for approximately $175,000.    Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.   
 The Old Man and the Sea—before offering the job to Dick Richards, whose directorial debut, The Culpepper Cattle Co. had come out the previous year.    However, they grew irritated by Richardss habit of describing the shark as a whale and soon dropped him from the project.  Meanwhile, Steven Spielberg very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, The Sugarland Express, for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated.  He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film Duel (1971 film)|Duel in that both deal with "these leviathans targeting everyman|everymen."  After Richardss departure, the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June 1973, before the release of The Sugarland Express. 
 typecast as the "truck and shark director".  He wanted to move over to 20th Century Foxs Lucky Lady instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure.    Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project, saying that "after  , you can make all the films you want".  The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5&nbsp;million and a shooting schedule of 55&nbsp;days. Principal photography was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike. 

===Writing===
For the adaptation, Spielberg wanted to stick with the novels basic concept, while removing Benchleys many subplots.  He declared that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last 120&nbsp;pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, "Id like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be very true to the book for the last third."  When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the screenplay.  The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a Writers Guild of America, West|Writer’s Guild strike, given Benchley was not unionized.    Overall, he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers;  delivering his final version to Spielberg, he declared, "Im written out on this, and thats the best I can do."  Benchley would later describe his contribution to the finished film as "the storyline and the ocean stuff – basically, the mechanics", given he "didn’t know how to put the character texture into a screenplay."  One of his changes was to remove the novels adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the Orca.  (During the films production, Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter.) 

Spielberg, who felt that the characters in Benchleys script were still unlikable, invited the young screenwriter John Byrum to do a rewrite, but he turned down the offer.    Tony and Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Howard Sackler was in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite; since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchleys drafts, they quickly agreed.  At the suggestion of Spielberg, Brodys characterization made him afraid of water, "coming from an urban jungle to find something more terrifying off this placid island near Massachusetts." 
 The Odd Couple.  Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script, asking what the writer would change and if there was a role he would be interested in performing.  Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes, and picked the part of Meadows, the politically connected editor of the local paper. He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job. 
 Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood also made uncredited contributions.    Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material.  One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the sharks death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a "big rousing ending."    The director estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.   
 Robert Shaw, who was also a playwright.    According to the director, Milius turned Sacklers "three-quarters of a page" speech into a monologue, and that was then rewritten by Shaw.  Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Miliuss contribution.

Though Spielberg complied with a request from Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors,  he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that "somewhat anonymous" performers would help the audience "believe this was happening to people like you and me", whereas "stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes ... corrupt the story."  The director added that in his plans "the superstar was gonna be the shark".    The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody,    and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island.  Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude.  Most minor roles were played by residents of Marthas Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer. 
 The French Connection. 
 From Russia with Love. And they were right."    Shaw based his performance on fellow cast member Craig Kingsbury, a local fisherman, farmer, and legendary eccentric, who was playing fisherman Ben Gardner.  Spielberg described Kingsbury as "the purest version of who, in my mind, Quint was", and some of his offscreen utterances were incorporated into the script as lines of Gardner and Quint. 
 The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, which he had just completed. Disappointed in his performance and fearing that no one would want to hire him once Kravitz was released, he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role in Jaws. Because the film the director envisioned was so dissimilar to Benchleys novel, Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read it.    As a result of the casting, Hooper was rewritten to better suit the actor,  as well as to be more representative of Spielberg, who came to view Dreyfuss as "my alter ego". 

===Filming===
 
 Bill Butler devised new equipment to facilitate marine and underwater shooting, including a rig to keep the camera stable regardless of tide and a sealed submersible camera box.  Spielberg asked the art department to avoid red in both scenery and wardrobe, so that the blood from the attacks would be the only red element and cause a bigger shock. 
 , Marthas Vineyard, was the primary location.   |alt=Fishing cottages and boats on Menemshas harbor.]] Sun Valley, California. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by renowned mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey, best known for creating the giant squid in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location.    In early July, the platform used to tow the two side-view sharks capsized as it was being lowered to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it.    The model required 14 operators to control all of the moving parts. 

The film had a troubled shoot and went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget "was $4&nbsp;million and the picture wound up costing $9&nbsp;million";    the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks.  Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname "Flaws".   Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," he said.  As for his lack of experience: "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank."    Gottlieb said that "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer he did not have to attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water". 

Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras got soaked,  and the Orca once began to sink with the actors on board.  The prop sharks frequently malfunctioned owing to a series of problems including bad weather, pneumatic hoses taking on salt water, frames fracturing due to water resistance, corroding skin, and electrolysis. From the first water test onward, the "non-absorbent" neoprene foam that made up the sharks skin soaked up liquid, causing the sharks to balloon, and the sea-sled model frequently got entangled among forests of seaweed.   Spielberg later calculated that during the 12-hour daily work schedule, on average only four hours were actually spent filming.  Gottlieb was nearly decapitated by the boats propellers, and Dreyfuss was almost imprisoned in the steel cage.  The actors were frequently seasickness|seasick. Shaw also fled to Canada whenever he could due to tax problems,  engaged in binge drinking, and developed a grudge against Dreyfuss, who was getting rave reviews for his performance in Duddy Kravitz.  Editor Verna Fields rarely had material to work with during principal photography, as according to Spielberg "we would shoot five scenes in a good day, three in an average day, and none in a bad day." 
 
The delays proved serendipitous in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes so that the shark was only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels.  The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie,  but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack.    Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin. This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the films suspense.    As Spielberg put it years later, "The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get thriller."  In another interview, he similarly declared, "The shark not working was a godsend. It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock than like Ray Harryhausen." The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark: "The more fake the shark looked in the water, the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances." 
 Ron and Valerie Taylor in the waters off Australia, with a smaller-framed actor in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the sharks were enormous. During the Taylors shoot, a great white attacked the boat and cage. The footage of the cage attack was so stunning that Spielberg was eager to incorporate it in the film. No one had been in the cage at the time, however, and the script, following the novel, originally had the shark killing Hooper in it. The storyline was consequently altered to have Hooper escape from the cage, which allowed the footage to be used.     As production executive Bill Gilmore put it, "The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfusss character." 
 wrap until October 6, 1974, after 159 days.   Spielberg, reflecting on the protracted shoot, stated, "I thought my career as a filmmaker was over. I heard rumors ... that I would never work again because no one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule."  Spielberg himself was not present for the shooting of the final scene in which the shark explodes, as he believed that the crew were planning to throw him in the water when the scene was done.  It has since become a tradition for Spielberg to be absent when the final scene of one of his films is being shot.  Afterward, underwater scenes were shot at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer water tank in Culver City, with stuntmen Dick Warlock and Frank James Sparks as stand-ins for Dreyfuss in the scene where the shark attacks the cage,  as well as near Santa Catalina Island, California. Fields, who had completed a rough cut of the first two-thirds of the film, up until the shark hunt, finished the editing and reworked some of the material. According to Zanuck, "She actually came in and reconstructed some scenes that Steven had constructed for comedy and made them terrifying, and some scenes he shot to be terrifying and made them comedy scenes."    The ship used for the Orca was brought to Los Angeles so the sound effects team could record sounds for both the ship and the underwater scenes.

 Mysterious Island, it suggests human respiration. He further argues that the scores strongest motif is actually "the split, the rupture"—when it dramatically cuts off, as after Chrissies death.  The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme,  which is exploited toward the films climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction. 
 Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score,     and Varèse Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.

However, the scene from Moby-Dick could not be licensed from the films star, Gregory Peck, its copyright holder.  Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingways The Old Man and the Sea: "Jaws is ... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway."   
 supernatural horror based on the sharks depiction of a nearly Satanic menace. 

Critics such as Neil Sinyard have noticed similarities to Henrik Ibsens play An Enemy of the People.    Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to Jaws as "Moby-Dick meets Enemy of the People."     The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside towns medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in Jaws by Brodys conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a "deft combination of Watergate and Ibsens play". 

===Scholarly criticism===
Jaws has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the films ideological meanings to the then-recent Watergate scandal. He argues that Brody represents the "white male middle class—  not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film", who restores public order "with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency".  Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine Jaws as a signal example of the film as "industrial product" that sells on the basis of "the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of Jaws is to be the most profitable movie)". 

Andrew Britton contrasts the film to the novels post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hoopers survival, the sharks explosive death) help make it "a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence." He suggests that the experience of the film is "inconceivable" without the mass audiences jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.  In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that "individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change".    Peter Biskind argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the towns venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by New Hollywood filmmakers of the era—involving Us vs. Them, hip counterculture figures vs. "The Man"—the overarching conflict in Jaws does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position. 

Whereas Britton states that the film avoids the novels theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,  Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. "Authority must be restored," he writes, "but not by Quint". The seamans "working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening ... irrational and out of control". Hooper, meanwhile, is "associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.  Britton sees the film more as concerned with the "vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them", which in turn helps generate a "pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to   stability and cultural continuity". 

Fredric Jamesons Marxist analysis highlights the polysemy of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read—from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very "polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently natural ones ... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence."  He views Quints demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, New Deal America and Brody and Hoopers partnership as an "allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations ... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it." 

Neil Gabler analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody). The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film. 

==Release==

===Promotion===
Universal spent $1.8 million promoting Jaws, including an unprecedented $700,000 on national television spot advertising.       The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the films opening two days later.  Beyond that, in the description of film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" for the pictures marketing.  As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film.  The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the movie.  The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer.    The poster was based on the paperbacks cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel.  The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that "no matter what we did, it didnt look scary enough". Seiniger ultimately decided that "you had to actually go underneath the shark so you could see his teeth." 
 game in which the player had to use a hook to fish out items from the sharks mouth before the jaws closed.   

===Theatrical run=== Long Beach, exploitation side James Bond series.       Still, the typical major studio film release at the time involved opening at a few big-city theaters, which allowed for a series of premieres. Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country, capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response. The outsized success of The Godfather in 1972 had sparked a trend toward wider releases, but even that film had debuted in just five theaters, before going wide in its second weekend. 

On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the remainder in Canada.    The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movies then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time.    (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures had done something similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout (1975 film)|Breakout, though that films prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.)   Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release.    Building on the films success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950.  Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.

===Box office performance===
Jaws opened with a $7 million weekend    and recouped its production costs in two weeks.  In just 78 days it overtook The Godfather as the highest-grossing film at the North American box office,  sailing past that pictures earnings of $86 million  to become the first film to reach $100 million in rentals.  Its initial release ultimately brought in $123.1 million in rentals.  Theatrical re-releases in 1976 and 1979 brought its total rentals to $133.4 million.   

The picture entered overseas release in December 1975,  and its international business mirrored its domestic performance. It broke records in Singapore,  New Zealand, Japan,  Spain,  and Mexico.   By 1977, Jaws was the highest-grossing international release with worldwide rentals of $193 million, equating to about $400 million of gross revenue;    it supplanted The Godfather, which had earned $145 million in rentals.

===Critical response===
Jaws received mostly positive reviews upon release.     magazine, Judith Crist described the film as "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" and complimented its acting and "extraordinary technical achievements".  Rex Reed praised the "nerve-frying" action scenes and concluded that "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department". 

The film was not without its detractors.   said that if not for Spielbergs deftly suspenseful direction, "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature."  Halliwells Film Guide claimed "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster."

==Legacy==
  at Universal Studios Florida]] major Hollywood studios.  According to Peter Biskind, Jaws "diminish  the importance of print reviews, making it virtually impossible for a film to build slowly, finding its audience by dint of mere quality. ... Moreover, Jaws whet corporate appetites for big profits quickly, which is to say, studios wanted every film to be Jaws."    Scholar Thomas Schatz writes that it "recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit, and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well. The film brought an emphatic end to Hollywoods five-year recession, while ushering in an era of high-cost, high-tech, high-speed thrillers."   
 auteur films increasingly disregarded in favor of profitable big-budget pictures.     The New Hollywood era was defined by the relative autonomy filmmakers were able to attain within the major studio system; in Biskinds description, "Spielberg was the Trojan horse through which the studios began to reassert their power." 

The film had broader cultural repercussions, as well. Similar to the way the pivotal scene in 1960s Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho made showers a new source of anxiety, Jaws led many viewers to fear going into the ocean.       Reduced beach attendance in 1975 was attributed to it,    as well as an increased number of reported shark sightings.  It is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior,    and for producing the so-called "Jaws effect", which allegedly inspired "legions of fishermen   piled into boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark-fishing tournaments."  Benchley stated that he would not have written the original novel had he known what sharks are really like in the wild.  Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks should be protected. 

Jaws set the template for many subsequent horror films, to the extent that the script for  ,  ,    which inspired a plagiarism lawsuit by Universal and was even marketed in some countries as a part of the Jaws franchise;    . 

Marthas Vineyard celebrated the films 30th anniversary in 2005 with a "JawsFest" festival,  which had second edition in 2012.    An independent group of fans produced the feature-length documentary The Shark is Still Working, featuring interviews with the films cast and crew. Narrated by Roy Scheider and dedicated to Peter Benchley, who died in 2006, it debuted at the 2009 Los Angeles United Film Festival.

A second LaserDisc was released in 1992,  before a third and final version came out under MCA/Universal Home Videos Signature Collection imprint in 1995. This release was an elaborate boxset that included deleted scenes and outtakes, a new two-hour documentary on the making of the film directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, a copy of the novel Jaws, and a CD of John Williamss soundtrack. 

MCA Home Video first released Jaws on VHS in 1980.   For the films 20th anniversary in 1995, MCA Universal Home Video issued a new Collectors Edition tape featuring a making-of retrospective.  This release sold 800,000 units in North America.    Another, final VHS release, marking the films 25th anniversary in 2000, came with a companion tape containing a documentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a trailer. 

Jaws was first released on DVD in 2000 for the films 25th anniversary, accompanied by a massive publicity campaign.  It featured a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (an edited version of the one featured on the 1995 LaserDisc release), with interviews with Spielberg, Scheider, Dreyfuss, Benchley, and other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, production photos, and storyboards.  The DVD shipped one million copies in just one month.  In June 2005, a 30th-anniversary edition was released at the JawsFest festival in Marthas Vineyard.    The new DVD had many extras seen in previous home video releases, including the full two-hour Bouzereau documentary, and a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of Jaws in 1974.    On the second JawsFest in August 2012, the Blu-ray Disc of Jaws was released,  with over four hours of extras, including The Shark Is Still Working.  The Blu-ray release was part of the celebrations of Universals 100th anniversary, and debuted at fourth place in the charts, with over 362,000 units sold. 

===Sequels===
Jaws spawned three sequels, none of which approached the success of the original. Their combined domestic grosses amount to barely half of the first films.  In October 1975, Spielberg declared to a film festival audience that "making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick".  Nonetheless, he did consider taking on the first sequel when its original director, John D. Hancock, was fired a few days into the shoot; ultimately, his obligations to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which he was working on with Dreyfuss, made it impossible.  Jaws 2 (1978) was eventually directed by Jeannot Szwarc; Scheider, Gary, Hamilton, and Jeffrey Kramer (who portrayed Deputy Hendricks) reprised their roles. It is generally regarded as the best of the sequels.
