Red Rock West is a 1993 neo-noir film directed by John Dahl. It was written by Dahl and his brother Rick, and shot in Montana and Willcox, Arizona. The film was well received at the prestigious Toronto Film Festival, but deemed a cable and direct-to-video product by Columbia Tri-Star, which owned the North American rights. When Bill Banning, the owner of a San Francisco movie theater and a huge fan of the film, arranged for a theatrical release, the film gained a "buzz" and toured the U.S.  as an art film|art-house hit.

==Plot==
Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work.

A local bar owner named Wayne (J. T. Walsh) mistakes him for a hit man, "Lyle from Dallas," whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash--"half now, half later"—and Michael doesnt correct him, taking the money.

Michael then visits Waynes wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town, but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper). Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her.

The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be bank robbers from another state, and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Waynes neck. Michael and Lyle fight with Lyle ending up being impaled on a gravestone. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead. 

Michael and Suzanne escape onto a nearby train, but when Suzanne tries to betray Michael, he throws the money out of the speeding train and then throws Suzanne off to be arrested by the arriving Police alongside a wounded Wayne. Michaels train continues its journey into a new town.

Test screenings for the film were not strong and Peter Graves, an independent consultant who headed the marketing department at Polygram said, "The film doesnt fall neatly into any marketable category. A western film noir isnt something people can immediately spark to."  One of the films producers suggested early on that the film be submitted to the Sundance Film Festival and was told by the studio that it wasnt a festival film.  Columbia sold Red Rock West to cable and it was shown seven times on HBO in the fall of 1993. 
 Roxie Cinema and Roxie Releasing in San Francisco saw Red Rock West in Toronto and thought that there might be an American theatrical audience for the film. It took him until January 1994 to find out who owned the rights.  The film had already played on HBO at this point and was due to come out on video in February.  Banning started showing Red Rock West at the Roxie Cinema on January 28, 1994 where it broke box office records before expanding to eight theaters in the city.  It then opened in Los Angeles and New York City.

==Music==
The soundtrack for the film features a number of country music performers, including Johnny Cash, Shania Twain, Toby Keith, The Kentucky Headhunters, and Sammy Kershaw. Dwight Yoakam wrote the films closing credits song "A Thousand Miles From Nowhere" when the film was being made and while the musician made his film acting debut in the film. The song went on to become a Top 10 country hit. {{cite news
