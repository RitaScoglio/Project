Harper then travels to New York City, where his best friend Lance (Morris Chestnut|Chestnut) is getting married to a young lady named Mia (Monica Calhoun|Calhoun), who is also an old friend by Harpers, and where Jordan (Nia Long|Long), Harpers old what-could-have-been female friend, has obtained an advanced copy of his book and has been passing it around their inner circle of friends. Due to its autobiographical nature, Harper never intended for any of them to read "Unfinished Business" prior to the wedding, but they do and eventually this wretched version of his novel makes its way to the groom. To the disgust of Quentin (Terrence Howard|Howard), Harper goes to great lengths to prevent Lance from completing his read of "Unfinished Business", but on the night of the bachelor party, Lance does just that. He is able in infer from the book that Harper slept with Mia while they were all in college. After he hostilely confronts Harper, Lance calls off the wedding.

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 72% positive rating based on reviews by 71 critics, with the sites consensus stating "With a strong cast and a host of well-defined characters, The Best Man is an intelligent, funny romantic comedy that marks an impressive debut for writer/director Malcolm D. Lee."  The film has earned a B+ average from users at the Yahoo! Movies site. 

 
Made on a relatively small budget of nine million dollars, the film went on to make over $34,000,000, nearly four times as much as it cost to produce the picture, by the end of its theatrical run. 

 
The film received numerous awards and accolades.  . Jason Clark in his Allmovie review even stated that although Taye Diggs does well in his first true starring role, Howard "commands the screen with such abandon that one secretly wishes the film could have been all about his oddly captivating character".
