 who was only 26 during the filming. According to Sinatra biographers George Jacobs and William Stadiem, Crosby kept his distance from Sinatra during the production and remained strictly professional when Sinatra desired companionship, and that it "killed" Sinatra to think that Crosby considered himself a higher class singer. They state that Sinatra was fascinated with Grace Kelly like many of her previous co-stars and that he would have loved to have had an affair with her but feared rejection and embarrassment in front of Crosby.

===Critical reception===
  and Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]] The Philadelphia Story, a previous adaptation of the same play starring Cary Grant in the Crosby part, Katharine Hepburn in the Kelly role, and James Stewart in an Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar-winning turn as the reporter played in the remake by Sinatra. Variety noted: "Fortified with a strong Cole Porter score, film is a pleasant romp for cast toppers Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Their impact is almost equally consistent. Although Sinatra has the top pop tune opportunities, the crooner makes his specialties stand up and out on showmanship and delivery, and Kelly impresses as a femme lead." 

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times described it as "flimsy as a gossip-columnists word," missing "the snap and the crackle that its un-musical predecessor had."  According to Time (magazine)|Time, in spite of its "Whos Who cast" the film is "simply not top-drawer"; a "good deal of the screenplay seems as dated today as the idle rich...  lacks the gawky animal energy that Katharine Hepburn brought to the 1939 play and the 1941 movie,   saunters through the part rather sleepily, without much of the old Bing zing  Sinatra plays the reporter like a dead-end kid with a typewriter."

 Allied Artists, told the press, "This just proves what weve known all alongâ€”that the Bowery Boys series couldnt have lasted this long if not for the fine writers." The joking in the press aside, Ullman and Bernds sent a telegram to the Academy Award Board of Governors, acknowledging the error and requesting their names be removed from the final ballot. While the request was granted, their nomination does stand on the official record.
