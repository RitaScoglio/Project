==Plot==
Emotionally withdrawn Joel Barish and unrestrained free spirit Clementine Kruczynski strike up a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk, New York. They are almost immediately drawn to each other despite their radically different personalities.

Although they do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are, in fact, former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a fight, Clementine hires the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all of her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this, Joel is devastated and decides to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps.
 in reverse. Upon seeing happier times of love with Clementine from earlier in their relationship, he struggles to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her. Despite his efforts, the memories are slowly erased, with the last memory of Clementine telling him, "Meet me in Montauk."

In separate but related story arcs occurring during Joels memory erasure, the employees of Lacuna are revealed to be more than peripheral characters. Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, is dating Clementine while viewing Joels memories, and copying aspects of their relationship in order to seduce her. Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, is dating the other memory-erasing technician, Stan. As it turns out, Mary had an affair with Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor who heads the company—a relationship which she agreed to have erased from her memory when it was discovered by his wife. Once Mary learns this, she quits her job, confronts Stan about his knowledge of her relationship with Howard (which he denies knowing about), steals the companys records, and sends them out to all the companys clients.

Joel and Clementine come upon their Lacuna records shortly after re-encountering each other on the train. They react with shock and bewilderment, given that they have no clear memory of having known each other, let alone having had a relationship and having had their memories erased. Joel beckons Clementine to start over; Clementine initially resists, pointing out it could go the same way. Joel accepts this, and they decide to attempt a relationship anyway, starting their life together anew.

==Literary references==
The title is taken from the poem Eloisa to Abelard by Alexander Pope, the story of a tragic love affair, where forgetfulness became the heroines only comfort:
 
How happy is the blameless vestals lot! 
The world forgetting, by the world forgot. 
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! 
Each prayr accepted, and each wish resignd;
 
Lacuna Inc., the fictional firm in the film, derives its name from the Latin " " which means a gap or missing part; lacunar amnesia is a gap in ones memory about a specific event.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was met with overwhelming acclaim, earning a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 93%, making it the second most acclaimed Jim Carrey film, after The Truman Show. Winslets and Carreys performances were generally praised. Roger Ebert commented, "Despite jumping through the deliberately disorienting hoops of its story, Eternal Sunshine has an emotional center, and thats what makes it work."  Ebert later included the film in his "Great Movies" series.  Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film for being "cerebral, formally and conceptually complicated, dense with literary allusions and as unabashedly romantic as any movie you’ll ever see." 
 Time Out summed up their review by saying, "the formidable Gondry/Kaufman/Carrey axis works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped inside ones own addled mind, and in allegorising the self-preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart." 

In 2006, in issue 201 of Empire (film magazine)|Empire, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was voted #83 in their 201 Greatest Movies of All Time poll as voted for by readers. That same year, Winslets performance as Clementine was included in Premiere magazines 100 Greatest Performances of All Time at #81. Claudia Puig, reviewer in USA Today said about her performance that "Winslet is wonderful as a free spirit whose hair color changes along with her moods. She hasnt had such a meaty role in a while, and she plays it just right." 

Carol Vernallis points out that Gondrys experience in directing music videos contributed to the films mise-en-scène and sound design. Vernallis describes some threads of the visual, aural and musical motifs throughout the film, and how some motifs can work in counterpoint. 
 Time Out New York ranked the film as the third-best of the decade:
 In the past, both director Michel Gondrys kindergarten arts-and-crafts aesthetic and Charlie Kaufmans Möbius-striptease scripts have come off as insufferably twee and gimmicky. So why does this existential meta-rom-com always leave us teary-eyed and genuinely moved?... he duo finally finds the right combination of high-concept and humanity here, taking the what-if idea of a company that lobotomizes the lovelorn into territory thats funny, painful, poetic and unsettlingly weird. {{cite journal

Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "Only the bizarre and byzantine brain of Charlie Kaufman could turn this 2004 story about erasing all memories of love into one of the most romantic movies of the decade."  Slant Magazine placed the film at number 87 on their list of the best films of the 2000s.  Paste Magazine named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000-2009), ranking it at number 5. 
 No Country for Old Men. The article states, "Its the rare film that shows us who we are now and who were likely, for better or worse, forever to be." 

It has been calculated to be the 11th most critically acclaimed film of the 2000s by virtue of its number of appearances on prominent films of the decade lists. 

In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked the film at #24 on its list of "101 Greatest Screenplays".
