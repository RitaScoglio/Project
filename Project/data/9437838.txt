}} 2000 Bollywood romantic drama film. It was the first of seven films in which currently married couple Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai starred together. The film is a remake of the 1995 Hollywood film A Walk in the Clouds.

== Plot ==
Sahiba is an intelligent, shy, and sensitive girl attending college a long way from home. She belongs to a typical Rajput family in which tradition requires that a girl give her consent to marry the man chosen by her family. Being a girl of contemporary times, Sahiba refuses to submit to age-old traditions. To avoid an arranged marriage, she lies that she is already married, which angers her father Yogi Grewal.

The fake husband is a handsome army captain, Karan. The two meet after Karan saves Sahiba from a group of men who are trying to kill her; Sahiba explains that she witnessed a murder, and the murderer sent his men after her. Karan decides to escort her safely home. Once home, the family mistakes Karan for Sahibas presumed husband, and Karan and Sahiba try but fail to tell the truth. Sahibas family take a great liking to Karan. Sahibas father, however, does not. At first, Karan is anxious to leave and go meet his friend Nisha, who he has fallen in love with but has not seen for a year. However, being an orphan, Karan soon gets carried away by the love and affection Sahibas family showers him with. Meanwhile, Sahiba falls in love with Karan. Following a misunderstanding in which the family celebrates Sahibas and Karans pregnancy (which did not occur), Karan decides that he should walk out. Before he can, a distressed Sahiba tells Karan that she loves him and begs him not to leave. He leaves anyway.

Upon meeting Nisha, he discovers that she has already married and had never taken him for more than a friend. Yogi, who had finally taken a liking to Karan after learning of the "pregnancy," is angry that Karan left and even more angry when Sahiba tells him that she and Karan were never married. Karan is overcome with grief and guilt for having left Sahiba for Nisha when Nisha did not love him. In his shock, Karan also discovers that he has fallen in love with Sahiba but had been too focused on Nisha to realize it. He decides to go back to Sahibas house and apologize. Upon entering, Yogi berates him and after revealing that he has arranged Sahibas engagement to another man, tells Karan to never come back.

Sahiba is horrified to find out that the man she is engaged to had murdered a girl at Sahibas college - the very murder she had witnessed. She explains this to her father, but he does not believe her; the young man in question, Vicky, happens to be the son of a family friend, Rai Singhal. Rai reveals his true colors when Yogi overhears him telling his son that they will use Sahiba to inherit her fathers money, then get rid of her. Karan, who had been reunited with Sahiba by her uncle Raunaq, and had been told who Vicky was, arrives at the scene and a brutal fight begins. It ends with Yogi and Karan being captured and trapped in Singhals warehouse, which Singhal and his henchmen have set on fire in order to ensure that Vicky and Sahibas wedding will not be disrupted. Karan and Yogi struggle to escape the fire.

The wedding takes place. Sahiba is so overcome with sorrow and stress that she swallows poison. Before the wedding is complete, Yogi and Karan arrive and beat down Singhal, Vicky, and their henchmen. Before everyone can celebrate, though, Sahiba collapses. They rush her to the hospital; Karan refuses to leave her bedside while shes unconscious. Soon she wakes up, and the doctors inform the family that she will live. Yogi declares that Karan and Sahiba are meant for each other. The last scene shows the family ushering a pregnant Sahiba out of the house and into a car. Karan quiets everyone down, shouts that its going to be a girl, and lifts Sahiba up and carries her away.
