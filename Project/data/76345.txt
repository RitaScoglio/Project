==Plot==
John Shaft, a private detective, is informed that some gangsters are looking for him. Police Lt. Vic Androzzi meets Shaft and unsuccessfully tries to get information from him on the two gangsters.  After Androzzi leaves, Shaft spots one of the men waiting for him in his office building. He commandeers the first gangster, forcing him into his office where the second gangster is waiting.  After a quick fight, Shaft dodges one of them who goes out the window, while the other surrenders and reveals to him that Bumpy, the leader of an uptown gang, wanted to meet Shaft and knock him out at his office.

At the police station, Shaft lies to Lt. Androzzi and his superior about the fight, by saying that his friend was in an "accident".  He is allowed to return to the streets for 48 hours.  Shaft arranges a meeting with Bumpy, the leader of these gangsters, in his office. It turns out Bumpys daughter has been kidnapped, and Shaft is asked to enable her safe return.

After tracking down Ben Buford as Bumpy suggested, Shaft is told by Vic after the shooting that Shaft himself, and not Ben, was the target, and that tensions brewing between the uptown hoods belonging to Bumpy Jonas and the downtown Mafiosi have culminated in a couple of murders.   but the perception is black against white to the general public, with the possibility of an escalation into full-blown race war on the streets of the city.  He also shows Shaft some pictures of two of the Mafia men who just arrived in New York.  Vic begs Shaft to explain whats going on, though Vic already knew Bumpy was looking for Shaft.

Streetwise, Shaft surmises that mobsters are watching his pad from a local bar.  Shaft pretends to be a barkeep and calls the police to have the mobsters arrested.  Shaft later goes to the police station to set a meeting to find where Bumpys daughter is being held captive.
 bugged and he is supposed to bring him in for questioning, but instead leaves. Ben and Shaft go to the apartment where Marcy Jonas is being held to make sure shes alive. Once there, a gunfight ensues during which two hoods get killed and Shaft takes a bullet in the shoulder.

Shaft goes home and receives medical attention from a doctor working underground with him  Shaft tells Ben to round up his men and meet him at the hotel where Marcy has been taken, to prepare to get her back.  He also calls Bumpy to tell him his daughter is fine and he is going to need some taxicabs to meet him at the hotel for the getaway.

Shafts plan resembles a military commando-style operation. Bens men all dress as hotel workers  to avoid arousing suspicion.  Shaft and one of Bens men go to the roof and prepare to enter the room where Marcy is being held captive.  Shafts plan is to cause a distraction with an explosive thrown through the window of Marcys room while Ben and his men come down the hall and deal with the Mafia men as they leave their rooms.

The rescue plan is successful. Marcy is spirited out of the hotel into one of the waiting taxicabs.  As the others get away in the remaining cabs, Shaft walks to a phone booth to call Vic.

===Critical reception===
 
Shaft was well received by film critics and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1971.     It currently holds a 88% "Fresh" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. 
 private eye BBCi retrospective, Michael Thomson noted " he film was hammered at the time for not being a full exposé of the black urban experience, and for being just a black version of a 40s Hollywood gumshoe thriller, yet Shaft certainly has a black sensibility ... and, even now, it seems radical to have a movie in which almost all the actors are black. However, the films violence, to which many objected at the time, will not cause much shock-horror in todays audiences. The attraction to them will be the stylish conversation and attitudes, as well as Richard Roundtree, who lends Shaft the right amount of charisma, swagger and untouchability."
