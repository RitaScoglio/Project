==Plot== drover and sheep shearer|shearer, roving the sparsely-populated back country with his wife Ida (Kerr) and son Sean (Anderson).  They are Swagman|sundowners, constantly moving, pitching their tent whenever the sun goes down. Ida and Sean want to settle down, but Paddy has wanderlust and never wants to stay in one place for long. While passing through the bush the family meet refined Englishman Rupert Venneker (Ustinov) and hire him to help drive a large herd of sheep to the town of Menindee Lakes|Cawndilla. Along the way, they survive a dangerous brush fire.

Mrs. Firth, who runs the pub in Cawndilla, takes a liking to Rupert. He takes to spending nights with her, but, like Paddy, he has no desire to be tied down.
 station shearing sheep; she serves as the cook, Rupert as a wool roller, and Sean as a tar boy. Ida enjoys the company of another woman, their employers lonely wife, Jean Halstead. When fellow shearer Bluey Browns pregnant wife Liz shows up unannounced, she sees the young woman through her first birth.

Ida is saving the money the family earns for a farm that they stayed at for a night on the sheep drive. Even though Paddy has agreed to participate in a shearing contest against someone from a rival group, he decides to leave six weeks into the shearing season. Ida persuades him to stay. He loses the contest to an old veteran.

Paddy wins a lot of money and a race horse playing Two-up. Owning such an animal has been his longstanding dream. They name him Sundowner and enter him, with Sean as his jockey, at local races on their travels after the shearing is done. Sean and Sundowner win their first race.

Ida finally convinces a still reluctant Paddy to buy the farm she and Sean have their hearts set on. However, he loses everything Ida has saved for the down payment in a single night of playing Two-up. By way of apology, he tells her that he has found a buyer for Sundowner if he wins the next race. The money would recoup their down payment. However, though Sundowner does win, he is disqualified for interference and the deal falls through. Nevertheless, Paddys deep remorse heals the breach with Ida, and they resolve to save enough money to buy a farm one day.

==Production== The Shiralee The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  Gary Cooper was hired to play Paddy Carmody, but had to leave due to poor health.

Filming began in 1959.  Zinnemann spent 12 weeks filming scenery and sheep herding before the cast arrived in October. The weather made location filming difficult, fluctuating from hot and humid to cold and rainy. This delayed production by several weeks and caused some irritation among the cast and crew. Mitchum was constantly harassed by fans and eventually had to move onto a boat to avoid them. Filming eventually wrapped on 17 December 1959.  A significant number of Australian actors appeared in the supporting cast. 
 Ray Austin was the stunt coordinator. Nicolas Roeg, who would later direct films such as Walkabout (film)|Walkabout, was a second unit camera operator. 

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther called the film an "especially appropriate entertainment for the Christmas holidays"; according to Crowther: 
 What is nice about these people and valid about this film, is that they have an abundance of freshness, openness and vitality. The action scenes are dynamic&mdash;the scenes of driving sheep, shearing them, racing horses at a genuine "bush country" track and simply living happily in the great sky-covered outdoors. And the scenes of human involvements—those between the husband and the wife, of a woman having a baby, of a footloose housewife looking at a stove&mdash;are deeply and poignantly revealing of how good and sensitive people can be. 
 film of 1961 in Australia.
