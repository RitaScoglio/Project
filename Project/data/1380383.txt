}} animated comedy film produced by Reginald Hudlin and Hyperion Pictures, directed by Bruce W. Smith, and released on July 31, 1992 by Paramount Pictures.

The first animated feature to feature an entirely African-American main cast,  the film is based upon comedian Robin Harris "Bébés Kids" stand-up comedy act. It features the voices of Faizon Love (in his film debut), Vanessa Bell Calloway, Marques Houston, Nell Carter, and Tone Lōc. Tom Everett, Rich Little, and Louie Anderson also lend their voices.

==Plot==
The film is based on a Stand-up comedy|stand-up routine of Robin Harris that is shown in a brief live-action segment at the beginning of the film.

The story of the film begins with an animated version of Harris woefully recounting his troubles to a blind bartender. He traces his problems all the way back to Jamika, an attractive woman who he met at a funeral. Outside the premises, Robin approaches Jamika and asks her out. Jamika picks up her mild-mannered son, Leon, from the babysitter and invites Robin to come along with her to an amusement park named Fun World, to which Robin agrees. The next day, Jamika introduces Robin to the children of her friend Bébé: Kahlil, LaShawn, and Pee-Wee. The group travels to Fun World, but are confronted by security before they can enter and are warned that they are being watched. Upon entering the park, the kids are set loose and promptly wreak havoc. Robins disastrous outing is further disrupted by a chance encounter with his obnoxious ex-wife, Dorthea.

After going on a couple of rides with the kids, Robin and Jamika let the kids go off on their own again as they attempt to enjoy a ride through the Tunnel of Love, where Jamika commends Robin for his endurance. While Robin and Jamika spend time together on their own, Leon tries to fit in with Bébés Kids but is unsuccessful. The kids then resume their trouble until they are caught by the security. However, they escape from the securitys trap and convince a bunch of other kids to spread the chaos. Meanwhile, Dorthea and her food-loving friend, Vivian, attempt to sabotage the growing relationship between Robin and Jamika but are thwarted by Robins mother insults. Elsewhere, in an abandoned building, Leon and Bébés Kids are captured by robot versions of the Terminator (character)|Terminator, Abraham Lincoln, a bear, and Richard Nixon and are put on trial. The "Terminator" acts as the judge who decides whether the kids are worth sending to the electric chair, while "Lincoln" acts as the kids defense attorney and "Nixon" as the Prosecution|prosecutor. The kids win their freedom through the power of rap, then celebrate their victory by stealing a pirate ship and crashing it into an ocean liner.
 Las Vegas, where Bébés Kids are recognized, and everyone runs away screaming. Pee-Wee pulls a plug that lights the entire city causing a blackout.

==Background==

===Original stand-up version===
In the original act, Robins prospective girlfriend asks him to take her and her son to Disneyland, but when he agrees she shows up with four kids.

As it turns out, Bébés kids are extremely rambunctious, misbehaved, ill-tempered, and flat-out bad. They terrorize park staff, cut off Donald Ducks feet, try to steal Robins 8-track tape|8-track/radio while hes listening to it, and make a general menace of themselves. Their reputation is so bad that even the police refuse to mess with them.

In the second act, the kids and his girlfriend pick up Robin from a bar and make him take them to Las Vegas. Pee-Wee picks up a power cord and the power goes out. 

===Animated film version===
The film made a few changes to the original story, reducing the number of Bébés kids from four to three (with the fourth depicted as Jamikas son instead) and moving the location from Disneyland to a generic amusement park named "Fun World," which is completely demolished by the kids antics.

Also, the film was heavily toned down in content to make it more appropriate for family viewing, although it still got a PG-13 rating for mild language and rude humor.
