==Accuracy== PMO bureaucrats commented on the general accuracy of the film with one major exception. Most characters in the film refer to Trudeau as "Mr. Prime Minister." This is improper Canadian government Protocol (politics)|protocol; the prime minister is simply referred to as "Prime Minister", although it is not uncommon for the Prime Minister to be addressed by the former as well as the latter. It is notable that actor R. H. Thomson refused to use the scripted address and ad-libbed instead.
