===Critical response===
Despite the fact that the film was made on a small budget, most reviews find the Casablanca (film)|Casablanca-like film entertaining.

When the film was released, the staff at Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine praised the film, writing, "Beginning is a bit too cryptic for quick understanding, but when plotline   does take shape, the story builds and holds attention. Joseph H. Lewis direction spins it along expertly, neatly pacing the suspenseful sequences." 

Time Out Film Guide praises director Lewis. "A tight little script and economically etched characters provide a strong foundation, but it is Lewis evocative visuals that really turn this into a poverty row gem." 

Some critics were a bit tougher in their review. Dennis Schwartz, gave the film a mixed review, writing, "Joseph H. Lewis (Gun Crazy/The Big Combo) does his best to make this tightly but uninspiring clich√©d film noir work. But even though he adds zest and style by his solid visual directing effort, this low-budget Casablanca wannabe still lacks force. Though this is one of the much praised poverty row directors poorer films, it still is an interesting watch due to the strange effects of the visuals and the surreal atmospheric location shots."
