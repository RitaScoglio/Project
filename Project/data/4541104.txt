}} Afzal Khan and Shaan (actor)|Shaan.

==Synopsis== Shaan and Shaan grows up in a cave due to his father being killed. His father was an Imam  who died in Moosa hands when a bunch of pandits/ came and attacked his Mosque. Saima comes along with her father who dies as well when some evil goons attack and she is taken hostage by Shamoon (Shafqat Cheema) for her exterior. What will Moosa do about this?

==Plot== Abid Ali. The Imam completes his prayer and emerges from the distance as pigeons and doves flutter about in a mad frenzy.

Meanwhile we are shown that across the way there is a temple where instead of doves of peace, there is a python by  large group of snarling, drooling old men in orange robes, with funky hairstyles who are cringing at the sound of the sermons from the nearby priest. So enraged are they by this sound and the Maulvi who is responsible for it that they hatch an evil scheme in collusion with the local godless firangi goras (white men - who worship only money) to bring about the end to the sound once and for all.

As the villains try to gun down the lecturing Imam their guns suddenly malfunction by divine intervention and when the ghastly Hindus decide to fire some heavy artillery and rocket launchers at the mosque (it appears divine intervention only disables rifles and pistols but not rocket launchers) the super-human maulvi appears magically leaping in the way of the projectiles, thwarting any attempt at desecrating the mosque. Then, while the background "audience" turns from Peace mode to crusade mode, the Maulvi mumbles a few pious utterances and launches his "tabees" (holy beads) into the air to see it transform in mid air into a holy Sword. He dramatically catches the falling blade and proceeds to hack to death the entire lot of goons who had dared to try to attack the mosque. As The imam finally caves in as his blimpish child Moosa, "sorry Moosa" the maulvi says in slow motion to the death scene, his eyes burning with the fire of vengeance.

Moosa grows up in a cave somewhere, having turned his back on his religion due to the disillusionment that he felt when his father was murdered. He has instead taken to living alone in some distant caves with his horse Sheru as company. Moosa (Shaan (actor)|Shaan) has turned into a cold hearted mercenary but all that is soon set to change with Saimas arrival. 

She shows up, dressed to kill with her father. He clearly had his own reasons for bringing his daughter to this place but when the goons start making moves on her he turns defensive and starts throwing moralizing lectures for this he gets shot by one of the goons. Shamoon (Shafqat Cheema) sporting his usual bizarre "get up" with flowing pony tail and reptilian accessories becomes obsessed by Saimas voluptuousness, Shamoon imprisons Saima in the lair. However in keeping with the films utterly warped manner Saima chooses to stab herself to death rather than to compromise her Izzat (Honor)|"izzat" (honour) . Shamoon has her stitched up in the nick of time, yet she remains merely a captive pet for her tormentor, waiting for the first opportunity to flee. Saima is rescued from Shamoons clutches one night by Moosa and whisked away to freedom, but just when she is beginning to take a fancy to her rescuer its revealed that all he intended to do was use her as part of a transaction or agreement. Saima is stunned when Moosa gives her over to another set of captors .Saima begs him not to do this, but he continues to walk away, stone faced and impassive. As Moosa is about to mount onto his horse and ride off into the distance, Saima comes up with a brainwave; she takes to covering her head with a scarf (in dramatic slow-motion) and starts reciting the words (with added echo effect) of the Quran in a last-ditch effort to get through to the stubborn Moosa. When Saima reaches a crescendo with the retort of "Kya tum Moosa nahin ho" (Are you not Moosa?) her words finally seem to hit the right spot and suddenly Moosa assumes the role that his father the saintly priest had always dreamed of.

Moosa forcefully bludgeons his way through the fully armed opposition and rescues again and makes away with Saima to the safety of the forest where they are joined by his childhood chum Jan(Rembo). Love blossoms and Saima and Moosa get married and build their dream home away from the troubles of the world but Shamoons henchmen are constantly searching every inch of the forest in order to recover Saima and destroy Moosa and it is a matter of time before they discover the mountainside home. Meanwhile Saima produces a child-thing and forces her husband to bury his weapons and to take to praying for solace.

One fateful day while the child and father are away hunting, Shamoons horrible henchmen show up. There follows the usual bloodbath and mayhem as child and dad return to begin their fight. In one of the more hysterical scenes of the movie we have Moosa performing his prayers when a goon with a huge machine gun arrives firing shot after shot at Moosa, but these giant bullets float in The Matrix|Matrix-like slow motion towards our hero and each time by divine intervention they somehow fail to hit their target. In a moment of sublime ridiculousness Moosa in fact catches the last bullet in mid air and tosses it aside disdainfully before striding out, (angels in full battle cry by now) to purge the land of all evil.
