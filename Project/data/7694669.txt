 Jigsaw Killers the last Lieutenant Daniel Rigg being put through a series of tests in order to try and let go of his obsession with saving everyone, whilst at the same time attempting to save his partner.

==Plot== John Kramers Art and Trevor awaken chained at the neck to a winch. Trevors eyes and Arts mouth are sewn shut, making communication impossible. In a blind panic, Trevor activates the winch and attacks Art. Art kills Trevor during the struggle, and takes a key from Trevors collar to free himself.
 Allison Kerrys Lieutenant Daniel Peter Strahm Lindsey Perez, Detective Eric his wife is leaving to be with her mother, and declines her plea for him to accompany her.

That night, Rigg and Hoffman are attacked by pig-masked figures. Rigg awakens in his bathroom and learns that Eric Matthews is alive and has ninety minutes to save himself, with Mark Hoffmans life at stake as well. In the meantime, Rigg must undergo his own tests in order to face his obsession and "truly learn how to save a life". His first test is in his living room, where  , Johns ex-wife, and she is brought to the station for questioning.
 Ivan Landsness, and place him in a prearranged trap in one of the rooms. After finding photo and video evidence that Ivan is a serial rapist, an enraged Rigg forces Ivan into the trap and leaves after handing him two controllers. Ivans test requires that he blind both eyes with blades, but he only succeeds in blinding one eye before the timer expires and the trap dismembers him.
 Cecil Adams, who slammed the door into her stomach while fleeing, causing her to miscarry. The agents are called to the motel, where they learn that they are now targets and that the room was rented out to Art Blank, who vanished two weeks prior. The man overseeing the current game is revealed to be Art when he prevents Matthews from jumping and hands him a gun.
 Morgan and Rex, a woman and her abusive husband, in a harness. They were impaled together by rods, which passed through vital circulatory points in Rexs body, but non-vital points of Morgans. By the time Rigg arrives, Morgan has removed all but one rod and passed out from shock, her husband long since dead. When she wakes up Rigg gives her the key to her harness, and tells her she must save herself. He then finds the location of his final test and leaves, pulling the fire alarm on his way out. The agents learn at the scene that all three dead victims were represented in court by Art, who was also Jills lawyer. They find Jigsaws puppet in another room, where a cryptic message is played for Perez before the puppets face explodes, sending shrapnel into her face and neck. After she is hospitalized, Strahm returns to the interrogation room and furiously interrogates Jill, now convinced Art is the accomplice. She reveals that Johns depression following the miscarriage ended their marriage as well as his partnership with Art, and that after surviving his suicide attempt he began his work testing others. His first victim, Cecil, was to push his face through several knives to release his razor blade arm and leg restraints. The trap collapsed, but Cecil died anyway when he lunged at John and fell into a tangle of razor wire.
 Jeff Denlon, his daughter is. Meanwhile, Art pulls out a small device and explains to Matthews and Hoffman that he can use it to release all three of them when the timer expires. If he tries to do so before then, a pair of pincers will sever his spine. Unaware of this, Rigg arrives and breaks into the room with one second to spare, just as Matthews shoots him, releasing two overhead ice blocks that swing down and crush Matthews head, killing him. A mortally wounded Rigg shoots and kills Art, believing he is responsible for the game, and learns from Arts tape recorder that he failed by interfering: Matthews would have lived if Rigg had not gotten involved. Hoffman, the real accomplice, releases himself from the chair and leaves Rigg to die, before sealing Strahm in the sickroom and leaving the plant. The scene then cuts to Johns autopsy, which took place after the events of the film.

===Reviews=== jumped the Nightmare on Friday the 13th movies eventually did."  Peter Hartlaub from The San Francisco Chronicle called it "the Syriana of slasher films, so complicated and circuitous that your only hope of understanding everything is to eat lots of fish the night before and then watch each of the previous films, in order, right before you enter the theater."  James Berardinelli wrote that "Saw IV functions as a drawn-out, tedious epilogue to a series that began with an energetic bang three years ago with Saw, then progressively lost momentum, coherence, and intelligence with each successive annual installment. Saw IV is nothing short of a money-grab. Despite a couple of loose ends (that are tied up unsatisfactorily here), Saw III finished the story." 

A less negative review came from Scott Weinberg from Fearnet, who said that while it "is almost certainly the weakest of the series where stuff like plot, logic, and chills are concerned... theres still more than enough here to keep the fans intrigued, entertained, and squirming in their seats" and added that the "Saw-makers are to be commended for actually putting forth this sort of effort. I grew up in an era that offered little more than quick-cash, stand-alone horror sequels like   and   â€” so the fact that these producers actually give a damn about narrative continuity (right down to the smallest detail) is fairly impressive."  Horror.com said that "with Saw IV, the pieces have all come together and   the best of the lot."  Jamie Russell from the BBC called it "deeply unsettling; just like a horror movie should be."  Chris Hewitt from St. Paul Pioneer Press claimed that "Saw IV is a fluid film, as neatly constructed as the deadly puzzles Jigsaw creates to snare his victims." Film School Rejects said that "One of the things that is most intriguing to me about the Saw movies is how much I actually have enjoyed them" and claimed that "As far as fourth installments in a series, Saw IV is quite impressive." Linda Cook from Quad-City Times gave it a positive review also and said "The twists and turns are deadly, the lessons are taught once again, and we have the perfect setup for Saw V."
