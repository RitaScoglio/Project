==Plot==
Clay Driscoll, a young coach from Louisana with dreams of being the head coach of a successful boys basketball team, is hired by an Oklahoma superintendent to coach basketball. Clay immediately finds himself head-to-head with Ellis Brawley, great-great grandson of the towns founder, owner of the bank, and head of the school board. Brawley has hired another man to coach the schools boys basketball team, and has relegated newcomer Driscoll to the unenviable job of coaching the girls team. Early 1960s Oklahoma is in the midst of a drought, and the school and town are facing economic distress. High school sports are an integral part of the towns fabric and pride, but girls sports are an afterthought and receive little attention. The girls team is more akin to a gym class than a basketball program. Clay is crushed by the news that the job he came for has gone to “someone more qualified”, and he sees no future in coaching the girls. 

With his future uncertain, Driscoll begins his task of coaching the girls team with little understanding of his players. Saying he only knows how to coach one way, he addresses his girls with the same discipline and determination he would with a boys team, but is bewildered at times by their rigid interpretation of his direction. He is often at a loss to deal with their play and their reactions to his coaching. With the support, encouragement and insight of his wife Jean, he is able to understand the girls he is coaching and reach them. Unbeknowst to Driscoll, his drive and commitmment to win is infectious. The girls accept what he asks of them, and they become committed to working hard to be as good as they can be. With the first year behind him and an offer to assist a boys team at another school, Clay decides to stay on and coach the Lady Cyclones. The following year his team shows a marked improvement, and they become a tough team to beat. However Driscoll and his girls basketball program are challenged at every step by Brawley, who is threatened by Driscoll and is willing to use the school board to undercut him. Driscoll and Jean fight the system and work to heal a wound in their own marriage. The community rallies behind Driscoll and the girls as they make a playoff run for the State Championship.

==Critical reception==
Entertainment Tonight | Entertainment Tonights film critic Leonard Maltin gave it three stars and wrote "Sincere heartland story rises above its familiar sports-underdog formula.  Donovan and Mathis (as his supportive wife) are first rate." 

Robert Koehler, the film critic for Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine gave the film a mixed review. He noted the number of basketball films being released at that time, and predicted: "Even with ties to the true story of high school hoops coach Jim Keith and his unlikely triumph with a 1960s Oklahoma high school girls squad, the hackneyed, overlong Believe in Me is much too similar to a recent flood of inspirational basketball pics to distinguish it. Carefully -- perhaps too much so -- crafted by writer-director Robert Collector as a tale of overcoming tall odds, pic will send out minor ripples in a large ocean of similar midrange indie projects and will have a hard time scoring in any commercial niche."
