==Plot==
Max (Sigourney Weaver) and Page Conners (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are a mother-daughter con artist team. When the film opens, the Conners are settling a con on Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner and small-time crook. The con, which the Conners have played a number of times before on other men, involves Max marrying Dean, passing out on their wedding night to avoid actually consummating the marriage, and then Page (posing as Deans secretary) luring Dean into a compromising position to justify Maxs immediate divorce and hefty settlement. The con is a success.
 IRS agent Palm Beach (the con would result in enough money to pay off the I.R.S. and set up Page to work on her own). For their target, they choose widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a tobacco baron who is addicted to his own product.
 Jason Lee), whom Page meets without her mothers knowledge while attempting to go after a target she pointed out earlier (a doctor who inherited money from an uncle; Max rejected him on the grounds that he was a "mommas boy" as he still lived with his mother). Page learns that Jack is worth $3 million, having inherited the bar, and decides to target him for a side con. Page ends up developing genuine feelings for Jack, but Max, who has been hurt many times before, tells her to break it off; Page reluctantly ends the relationship.

Tensy proposes to Max ahead of schedule, but before they can get married, he passes out and dies while trying to consummate the relationship, because of a lifetime of smoking. While Max and Page are deciding what to do with the body, Dean arrives, having tracked Max down in order to propose to her again. Dean figures out that Max and Page played a ruse on him, and threatens to expose them to the authorities. Max offers to return Deans divorce settlement money if hell help them make Tensys death look like an accident. Max reveals to Page that the money wasnt really taken by the IRS and the agent had in fact been Maxs mentor, Barbara, in a ruse to prevent Page from leaving. But when Max, Page and Dean go to the bank, the money really has gone, liquidated in an act of betrayal by Barbara.

In order to help Max, Page decides to accept Jacks offer of marriage, planning to work it as a regular con. Page insists that Jack will not cheat on her, but is heartbroken when during the wedding night she breaks into her mothers room and finds him in a compromising position with Max. After the divorce settlement is paid, Dean confronts Max about the ethics of their con, pointing out that even a "goody-goody" like Jack is only human. Max reveals that Jack actually turned her down and that she had to drug him in order put him in the position where Page found them, while claiming that Jack would have gone on to hurt Page eventually by cheating. Dean counters that Max has no right to keep Page from the man she loves and who loves her back just because of what might happen.

Chastened, Max tells Page the truth, admitting that her own efforts to protect her daughter from pain have only hurt her in other ways, recognising that Page has to make her own decisions and mistakes. Page returns to Jack, giving him back the bar hed had to sell to pay the settlement, and tells him her real name. Max and Dean also get together, Dean having admitted that he still misses Max even after what she put him through. The final shot of the film is of Dean &mdash; using the name Stanley &mdash; romancing Barbara, with Max watching them via binoculars, implying that Max and Dean are now working together to get Maxs money back from Barbara.

==Production==
 
The film had been in the works for quite a long time. Originally, Ang Lee was set to direct with Anjelica Huston and Alicia Silverstone playing the roles of "Max" and "Page". However, due to the long pre-production stage, both actresses had to bow out of the film due to scheduling conflicts. In 1999, it was then announced that Anjelica Huston and Cameron Diaz were set to play the two leading roles, with Doug Liman directing but then Liman backed out of the project, creating quite a long time frame to find a new director. Huston and Diaz both had to bow out as well. Cher became attached and brought in David Mirkin to direct and rewrite the script. Jennifer Aniston also became attached at this time. Cher then dropped out to do a world tour for her unexpected #1 hit album Believe (Cher album)|Believe and the mother/daughter roles went to Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt. R&B singers Whitney Houston and Brandy Norwood were briefly considered for the leading mother/daughter roles. Norwoods touring schedules did not allow her to commit to the film and Houstons drug battle prevented her from working at the time.
