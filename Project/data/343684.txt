== Plot ==
 David Warner) visits John Trent (Sam Neill), a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and asks Trent to recount his story:

After exposing an insurance fraud|arson-fraud scam, Trent, an insurance investigator, has lunch with a colleague who preps him on his next assignment, investigating a claim made by New York-based Arcane Publishing. During their conversation, Trent is attacked by a man wielding an axe who is shot dead by a police officer before he can harm Trent.
 horror novelist Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), and recovering the manuscript for Canes final novel. He assigns Canes editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), to accompany him.

Linda explains the stories are known to cause disorientation, memory loss, and paranoia in "less stable readers." Trent remains skeptical, convinced that the disappearance is merely an elaborate publicity stunt. Trent notices a series of red lines on Canes books covers that, when aligned properly, form the outline of New Hampshire and mark a location alluded to be Hobbs End, the fictional setting for many of Canes works.

As they set out to find the town, Linda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late-night drive, inexplicably arriving at Hobbs End in daylight. Trent and Linda search the small town and begin encountering people and landmarks described as fictional in Canes novels. Trent believes it all to be staged, but Linda disagrees. She admits to Trent that Arcane Publishings claim was indeed a fraudulent stunt to promote Canes book, but the time distortion and exact replica of Hobbs End were never part of the plan.

Linda heads to a church to confront Cane, and is exposed to his final novel, In The Mouth of Madness, which drives her insane. A man approaches Trent in a bar and warns him to leave, then commits suicide. Outside the bar, a mob of monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon him. Trent attempts to drive away from Hobbs End but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town. After crashing his car, Trent awakens inside the church, where Cane explains that the publics belief in his stories have freed an ancient race of monstrous beings that will reclaim the Earth. Cane reveals that Trent himself is merely one of his characters who must follow Canes plot and return the manuscript of In The Mouth of Madness to Arcane Publishing, ushering the end of humanity.
 film adaptation in post production. Trent is arrested after he murders a reader of the newly released novel.

After Trent finishes telling his story, Dr. Wrenn judges it a meaningless hallucination. Trent wakes the following day to find the asylum abandoned. He departs as a radio announces that the world has been overrun with monstrous creatures, and that outbreaks of suicide and mass murder are commonplace. Trent goes to see the In the Mouth of Madness film and discovers that he is the main character in the film. As he watches his previous actions play out on screen, Trent begins laughing hysterically before breaking down crying.

== Production ==
 
Michael De Luca wrote the script in the late 1980s and one of the first directors he offered it to was John Carpenter,  who initially passed on the project.  New Line Cinema later announced production in 1989 with director Tony Randel attached to direct.     Later Mary Lambert was also attached to direct.   A few years later, Carpenter signed on as director in December 1992 and filming took place from August to October 1993.

  asylum with Old Ones Pickman family). As read on-screen, Sutter Canes writings even incorporate direct passages from his work.  Sutter Canes novels have similar titles to H.P. Lovecraft stories : The Whisperer of the Dark (The Whisperer in Darkness), The Thing in the Basement (Thing on the Doorstep), Haunter out of Time (The Haunter of the Dark/The Shadow Out of Time) etc.

The film can also be seen as a reference to Stephen King, who, like Lovecraft, also writes horror fiction set in New England hamlets.   King is mentioned towards the beginning of the movie; it is suggested that Canes work is more frightening than Kings and that he outsells King.

== Release and reception ==
 

In the Mouth of Madness was released on December 1994 in Italy and then released on February 3, 1995 in the US. It grossed $3,441,807 the first weekend and garnered $8,946,600 total in revenue during its run.    It was a financial disappointment, but it did earn enough to cover the films budget.

The film received mixed critical reaction, with 14 positive reviews out of 29 tallied by Rotten Tomatoes for a score of 48%.  It ranked 10th by Cahiers du cinéma. 

In their book  , Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: "No film reviewed in this book is so strongly divisive as In the Mouth of Madness. This is a film people either love or hate – there seems to be no in-between. The films weakness is the generic rock soundtrack composed and performed by director John Carpenter, and the disjointed script that apparently left the actors as confused as the plot. The films strength is its Lovecraftian themes and the concept that the writer, Sutter Cane, is changing reality through his writings." 

A Blu-ray Disc release by New Line Cinema was released on October 15, 2013.
