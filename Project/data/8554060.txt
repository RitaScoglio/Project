}} 1913 silent tale of the same name by Nikolai Gogol. Unlike most of Starevichs films, it is mainly live-action.

== Plot ==
The plot is, on the whole, close to Gogols classic tale.

The action is set in a Cossack stanitsa. inebriated Cossacks cant find their way to a shinok (tavern) and decide to go home. One by one, they each come to visit Soloha, who hides each one (starting from the demon) in bags so that none of them see each other.

  Metalsmith (P. caroling company. Vakula, who is left only with the bag containing the demon, goes to Patsyuk, a Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer, to ask him how to find a demon - only with the help of a demon can he hope to get Tsarinas shoes.

The Patsyuk answers that a person should not search for a demon if he has a demon behind his back. Vakula takes it as some kind of a murky wise say, but indeed eventually finds the demon in the bag and forces him to take him to St. Petersburg. There, Prince Potemkin takes him for an ambassador of the Zaporozhian Cossacks and gives him Tsarinas shoes. The demon takes Vakula home and Vakula lets him go. Oksana agrees to marry Vakula.

==Significance==
* The first time that an adaptation of The Night Before Christmas was filmed which was true to the letter and spirit of the original. galushkis at Patsyuks place, and in the scene where the demon shrinks and hides in Vakulas pocket.

==Critical reaction==
From the journal "Kino-theatre and life" («Кино-театр и жизнь», 1913, № 2):
 "The Night Before Christmas" (after Gogol) is a very well written and acted cinema piece; however, not without some deficiencies in the scenes of crowds. Of all artists, who by-and-large performed well, it is impossible not to distinguish the makeup and acting of Mr. Mozzhukhin in the role of the demon. The fantastic sections of Solohas flight on a broom and Vakulas on the demon are not carried off well, but the spectacular trick of the demons shrinking was skillfully done. This picture will have success in Russia as a live illustration to the work of literature well- known to all the Russian public. 

From the journal "Cinematography news" («Вестник кинематографии», 1913, № 24):
 Some scenes - such as, e.g., the scene at Solohas, meeting the Stanitsa Head fetched out of the bag by Chub (a Cossack), Patsyuks dinner and many others - shine with distinctively Gogolian humour and play over the incessant laughter of the public... The film is made excellently, including the minute details which create the reality of the Ukrainian life.
