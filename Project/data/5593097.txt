Texasville is a 1990 American drama film directed by Peter Bogdanovich. It is a sequel to The Last Picture Show, and based on the novel Texasville by Larry McMurtry.

Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Cloris Leachman, Timothy Bottoms, Randy Quaid and Eileen Brennan reprise their roles from the 1971 film. Texasville is in color, while The Last Picture Show was filmed in black and white. The film got mostly mixed reviews and did not do well at the box office.

==Plot==
In 1984, 33 years after the events depicted in  The Last Picture Show, 50-year-old Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) is a wealthy tycoon of a near bankrupt oil company. His relationship with his family isnt prospering either. His wife, Karla (Annie Potts), believes that Duane is cheating on her and his son, Dickie (William McNamara), seems to be following in his fathers libidinous footsteps.

Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) works as Duanes secretary; and despondent Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid), now a businessman, seems a prime candidate for a business crisis or a heart attack or both.

Sonny Crawfords (Timothy Bottoms) increasingly erratic behavior causes Duane concern over Sonnys mental health.

Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) has traveled the world and experienced its pleasures. A painful tragedy brings her back to her hometown and once again into Duanes life.
