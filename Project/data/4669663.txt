==Plot==
The film follows two 12-year-old boys; Romeo and his best friend Gavin. Gavin has a serious spinal problem for which he has to undergo surgery. The story follows them as they undergo a tumultuous period in their childhood. After saving them from a beating, Morell befriends the two boys and takes a liking to Romeos older sister, Ladine Brass. However, when Gavin plays a practical joke on Morell to make him look foolish in front of Ladine, things turn sour for the pair. In retaliation, Morell attempts to drive a wedge between the two best friends in order to keep them apart thus ensuring he stays close to Romeo and Ladine. But when Ladine rejects Morells advances he becomes increasingly violent towards Romeo, Gavin, and all around them.
