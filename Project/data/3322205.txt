Pooja Dharamchand (Pooja Bhatt) is the daughter of a rich Mumbai shipping tycoon, Seth Dharamchand (Anupam Kher). She is head-over-heels in love with movie star Deepak Kumar (Sameer Chitre), but her father strongly disapproves of their courtship. One night, Pooja escapes from her fathers yacht and hops onto a bus to Bangalore to be with Deepak, who is shooting for a film there. Meanwhile, Seth Dharamchand, realizing his daughter has run away, dispatches private detectives to locate her.

Aboard the bus, Pooja meets Raghu Jetley (Aamir Khan), a loud-mouth newspaperman, who has just lost his job. He offers to help her in exchange for an exclusive story on her, which would revive his flagging career. Pooja is forced to agree to his demands, as he threatens to let her father know of her whereabouts should she not comply. After the bus breaks down, Raghu and Pooja go through various adventures together and find themselves falling in love with one another. Raghu desires to marry Pooja, but knows that financially he is in no shape to do so. He simply wanted a story on her life and never wanted to win her heart. Pooja also falls for Raghu and she decides to go with him, but a misunderstanding leads her to believe that Raghu was just looking for a story and not her love.
