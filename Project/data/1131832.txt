==Plot== Bunsen and Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker) also come to Scrooges offices collecting money in the spirit of the season to provide a Christmas dinner for the poor. Scrooge rebuffs his nephew and complains that it is not worth looking after the poor, as their deaths will decrease the surplus population. Fred is shocked at his uncles uncharitable and cold nature, but repeats his invitation, makes his own donation, and departs. Bean Bunny shows up asking for a penny to hear his song, but Scrooge throws a wreath at him.
 Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf) who have been condemned to shackles in the afterlife as punishment for the horrible deeds they committed in life. However, they warn him that he will share the same fate, only worse, if he does not change his ways, and foretell the arrival of three spirits throughout the night.
 Jessica Fox), a childlike specter who takes Scrooge on a journey back through time to his youth. He recalls his early school days, during which he focused on his studies under the Schoolmaster (Sam Eagle). At a later life working at a rubber chicken factory called Fozziwig and Ma Ltd. owned by Fozziwig (Fozzie Bear) where he attends Fozziwigs party (with music provided by Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem). Then Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle (Meredith Braun), with whom he would later fall in love and become engaged to. Eventually, Belle ends their relationship as she knows, despite Scrooges protests that he would marry her as soon as he feels he has enough money to provide for them, he will most likely never have enough.
 Tiny Tim (Robin the Frog) who has an illness. When Scrooge asks if Tiny Tim will live, the Ghost of Christmas Present states that he wont survive to next Christmas as the Ghost of Christmas Present begins to expire.
 businessmen are undertaker steal fence named epiphany that convinces Scrooge to change his ways, and makes him vow to celebrate with his fellow man.

He returns to his bedroom on Christmas Day (the narrators have also returned as well), and goes about the town spreading good deeds and charity. He enlists the help of Bean Bunny and the two travel around the town gathering items for a Christmas feast and giving gifts to characters who had previously been wronged by Scrooge, as well as gifts to Fred and a visit to the retirement home where Fozziwig and the Schoolmaster currently reside. Arriving finally at the Cratchits home, Scrooge makes a false show of his old meanness, pretending to reprimand Bob for not being at work that morning, despite having reluctantly granted him leave the previous day. To the amazement and delight of Bob and his family, Scrooge then jovially announces that he is going to raise Bobs salary and pay for their houses mortgage. He also plans a feast for the family, and learns to adopt the spirit of Christmas throughout the year as he and the Cratchits are joined in the feast with the rest of the town.

==Production==
The Muppet Christmas Carol was one of the ideas by Jim Henson shortly after the Muppets joined Disney and was directed by Jim Hensons son Brian Henson|Brian. Taking over the puppeteering role of Kermit, originally performed by Jim Henson before his death in 1990, was Steve Whitmire (Whitmire had already first performed Kermit in the 1990 CBS special The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson, aired six months after Hensons death). It was shot in Shepperton Studios, England and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 
 Richard Hunt could not perform any of the Muppets because he had contracted AIDS. He passed away 12 months before the films release.

This is the first Muppet film in which the story revolves around characters played by human beings, specifically Ebenezer Scrooge as played by Michael Caine. The rest of the cast consisted of mostly Muppet performers. Several pivotal roles—in particular, the three Christmas Spirits—were portrayed by specially-created Muppet characters. It was at one time considered that well-known Muppets would be cast in these roles (Miss Piggy, Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter, and Gonzo the Great|Gonzo, specifically) before it was decided that it would detract from the ominous effect the spirits would need to convey. Only the Ghost of Christmas Present is clearly a Muppet (albeit a giant one), while the Ghost of Christmas Past is an ethereal childlike spirit and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is a hooded robed and terrifying wraith as per tradition. The Ghost of Christmas Past effects were created by making a special puppet that was operated in a tank of water and then chroma key|green-screened into the film, to make it look like it was floating.

It is also the first Muppet film to exclude Sesame Street Muppet characters in its production (not counting Kermit).

==Release==

===Critical reception===
Disney appeared to have high expectations for the film, being their widest-released film of the holiday season and the second widest release under the   and Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disneys Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin. The film grossed a total of $27,281,507 domestically. Critical reception, however, was mostly favorable.     It currently has a 69% on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus being, "It may not be the finest version of Charles Dickens tale to grace the screen, but The Muppet Christmas Carol is funny and heartwarming, and serves as a good introduction to the story for young viewers."

===Home media=== Region 1. Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the film on DVD on November 29, 2005 in conjunction with Kermit the Frogs 50th anniversary celebration; this time the DVD contained both full-screen and widescreen presentations. The film was also released in Region 2.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released a "20th Anniversary Collectors Edition" on Blu-ray disc|Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy on November 6, 2012.  The release did not include the films extended cut or "When Love is Gone".

==="When Love Is Gone"===
"When Love Is Gone" was a song performed by the character Belle (Meredith Braun) as she laments that Scrooges love for money has replaced his love for her.  The song was cut from the original 1992 theatrical release by Jeffrey Katzenberg of Walt Disney Studios, who believed that the scene would not appeal to young children. The movie plays with an obvious, jarring edit when the film is played with the song missing. Brian Henson objected to their decision, believing that the song was integral to the plot (the concluding song, "When Love is Found", is a direct counterpoint to it), and the song was subsequently restored to the fullscreen VHS and Letterboxed Laserdisc editions. This song was also cut from the 20th Anniversary Edition of the film released on DVD (widescreen only; however, the fullscreen version has the song). The song was also not included on the Blu-ray, or the DVD disc that is packaged with the Blu-ray combo pack released in 2012, and this version of the film on the HD release features new and different music editing to disguise the jarring edit. The song is also absent from the edition of the film featured on Netflix.
