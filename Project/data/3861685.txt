==Plot==
The film starts with Huo Yuanjia fighting three Westerners: a British boxer, a Belgian lancer, and a Spanish fencer. Huo defeats all three of them and has a flashback before the next fight with a Japanese fighter Anno Tanaka.

Huo Yuanjia watches his father Huo Endi teaching students martial arts and wants to participate, but his father is concerned about his asthma and refuses to allow him to practice martial arts. Huo Yuanjia then sees his father in a leitai match with another martial artist named Zhao, who won the fight dishonourably by retaliating when Huo Endi held back what would have been a fatal blow. Huo Yuanjia feels humiliated by his fathers defeat and vows to regain his familys honour and pride. He practices martial arts secretly behind his fathers back. As the years pass, Huo Yuanjia defeats several opponents in leitai matches and becomes one of the most famous martial artists in Tianjin. However, as he becomes increasingly successful and popular, he also becomes more arrogant and ruthless towards his opponents. His late father, however, advocated the practice of showing mercy and not doing any serious physical harm to opponents.

 

When a rival martial arts master named Qin Lei injures one of his followers, Huo feels insulted and confronts Qin at the latters birthday party. The confrontation escalates into a fight between Huo and Qin, in which Huo emerges as the victor by killing Qin with a fatal blow to the chest. However, Qins godson seeks vengeance on Huo and kills Huos mother and daughter in retaliation. Guided by fury, Huo goes to Qins house, where Qins godson admits to the murders before killing himself. Later, Huo learns that it was his follower who had insulted and provoked Qin earlier, which prompted his beating.

Overwhelmed with grief and shame, Huo flees Tianjin and wanders aimlessly for many months. A dishevelled, greying wanderer, he nearly drowns in a river, but is saved by Granny Sun and her blind granddaughter Yueci. They bring him back to their village and Huo, guided by their simple acts of kindness, begins to learn the value of compassion and mercy.

In 1907, Huo returns to Tianjin and sees the changes that have taken place in his absence. He apologises to the family of Qin and reconciles with his childhood best friend, the businessman Nong Jinsun, whom he had offended earlier. He challenges the American wrestler, Hercules OBrien, who had been making headlines by defeating Chinese martial artists and calling the Chinese "weak men of the East". During their match, Huo saves OBrien from being impaled on some nails on the side of the ring (which had become exposed during the fight) and he wins the appreciation of OBrien, who names Huo the victor. Huos fame begins to spread with successive challenges with other foreign fighters. In 1909, with funding from Nong Jinsun, he founds Chin Woo Athletic Association in Shanghai.

The members of the foreign chamber of commerce fear that Huos victories might fan anti-foreign sentiments among the Chinese people and thus become a disadvantage to them. They propose a match between Huo and four foreign champions. Huo takes up the challenge, even though it is an unfair one. Before the matches, Huo meets the Japanese champion Tanaka for tea and strikes up a friendship with him.

On 14 September 1910, Huo - after quickly defeating european challengers - faces Tanaka in a titanic battle. In the first round, they fight with their weapons of choice. Huo uses a three-section staff while Tanaka uses a katana. The first round is a draw, although during the fight fighters accidentally exchanged weapons - at this point while Huo was able to handle a sword proficiently, Tanaka - unfamiliar with exotic weapon of his opponent - was clearly at a disadvantage. Honorably - Huo exchanged weapon with Tanaka. Before the next round, Huo unknowingly drinks from a  poisoned cup of tea. The poisoning is the work of the members of the foreign chamber of commerce, who are in attendance and wish to assure their victory. In the second round involving unarmed combat, Huo suddenly has difficulty breathing and begins to lose his strength. He collapses and starts coughing-up blood, the result of arsenic poisoning. Tanaka and Huos supporters immediately demand that the match be halted and postponed, but Huo replies that he wishes to continue, since he is going to die in any event. Huo is dominated by Tanaka but he does manage to deliver a blow to Tanakas chest, similar to the one he used on Qin, but this time holds back what might have been a killing blow. He then collapses, and Tanaka - being aware of what happened - declares Huo the victor as Huo dies. The final scene shows Huos spirit practising Wushu on the field as Yueci observes him with a tearful smile. Huo turns to her and smiles in return lovingly, indicating a lovers reconciliation.

==Production==

===Alternate versions===
The film was originally approximately 140 minutes long, but to fit market demand, it was cut to 105 minutes, and scenes by Michelle Yeoh and a fight between Jet Li and a Thai boxer, portrayed by Somluck Kamsing, were removed. A special release of the film in Thailand in March 2006 reinserted the scenes with Somluck (but not Michelle Yeoh), making its new running time approximately 110 minutes. In January 2007, Ronny Yus original 140-minute directors cut was given an official DVD release in Hong Kong, featuring the full Michelle Yeoh subplot as well as the fight with Somluck Kamsing.

Within the Somluck Kamsing scene, there are two different endings. In the directors cut, the fight ends after Huo Yuanjia stops the Thai boxer from falling head first. In an alternate scene, the Thai boxer continues to fight after this and Huo appears to kill him with the exterminating blow, only to see that he had resisted, in which the boxer realises this and ends the fight.

====Directors cut====
Universal released the full 140-minute directors cut on DVD in North America in July 2008.  The released DVD, however, contained 2 discs and has been reported to errantly contain both the existing US theatrical version and the existing unrated version and not the actual directors cut on either of the discs. However, many people were able to get replacement copies that had the directors cut after sending a complaint on their website.

On December 2008, Universal released the Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray version of the film, which contains the three versions (Theatrical, Unrated, and Directors Cut) in a single disc.

* Before we see Huo as a child, a scene of him is shown seeking passage on a boat, with the boatman taking a small jade jewel out of a sack as payment from Huo (shown later to be the gift that Huos daughter intended to give him when he wins his fight). This will also later be shown to be a scene of Huo wandering in despair.
* Before Huo and his friend, Nong Jinsun, as children, go to see Huos father fight, there is a scene of Huo showing Nong his fathers certificates from winning fights.
* There are scenes of Nong, as a child, copying the Huo familys wushu manual for Huo Yuanjia so he can learn.
* A scene was added of Huo Yuanjia, as a child, getting his revenge and defeating the son of master Zhao.
* After Huos minor confrontation in the streets with Qin Lei, a scene is added of Huo beating his disciples for not working hard enough.
* An extra scene of Huos family, waiting for him to come home after his competition.
* The montage of Huo wandering in despair is longer, as well as his time with the villagers.
* A scene was added of a young boy from the village, Gui, getting beaten by members of another neighbouring village, for stealing an ox (after his died). The villagers of Huos village protest to let him go, and when the man of the other village refuses, Huo offers to take Guis punishment instead. He has to let a Thai boxer beat him until an incense stick burns out. Huo allows the Thai boxer to beat him until members of his village protest. Huo defends himself from the Thai boxer, but does not fight back. When the Thai boxer is about to hit his head on the ground, Huo saves him, and the Thai boxer bows in respect, and agrees to let Gui and the other villagers go.
* In his time with the villagers, Huo has a talk with two village boys about wushu, and makes them explain why they want to learn it.
* When Huo returns home, the black-and-white footage of battle shown at the beginning of the theatrical version is now shown right before Huos return to Tianjin, with subtitles explaining that after the Qing Dynasty, foreign armies invaded China, and made Tianjin a semi-colony. Also added was a scene of Huo giving master Zhao, whom he defeated earlier in the beginning of the film, his copy of the Huo familys wushu manual. He later comes to Jingwu school and joins.
* After the main credits, Ms. Yang is walking away from the meeting, with a reporter asking her if she thinks she will succeed. She responds saying that she had done her best, and that is what is important. When the reporter asks, "Is it enough?", she smiles and walks away.

==Controversy==
The descendants of Huo Yuanjia were so upset by how their ancestor was portrayed in Fearless, as well as by the historical inaccuracies in the film, that they launched a lawsuit against Jet Li and the films producers and distributors in March 2006. Huo Shoujin, an 81-year-old grandson of Huo Yuanjia, stated he was unhappy that the movie showed Huo Yuanjia causing "trouble", which led to the deaths of his mother and daughter.  Huo Shoujin also denounced the filmmakers for depicting his grandfather as a violent fighter.  In December 2006, a court in Beijing dismissed the case, saying Fearless was an exaggerated and fictitious portrait of Huo Yuanjia but it "contained no defamatory or libelous depictions". 

==Soundtrack==
