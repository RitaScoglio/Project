==Production== Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, in a splashy musical comedy specializing in costumes so purposely skimpy that it garnered a condemnation by the Catholic Legion of Decency. The outrageous outfits were designed by Howard Hughes and the craftsmen at RKO to display Russells physique to best advantage. Russells singing, dancing, and comedic skills are also much in evidence. The film was considered scandalous at the time.

==Controversy==
Producer Howard Hughes was no stranger to controversy, especially when it came to Jane Russell.  His focus on Janes cleavage in The Outlaw ran afoul of The Production Code in 1941. The film was held up until 1943 before it was finally given a limited release.
The French Line had its own set of controversies.  Janes ample bosom literally popped out of the screen in 3-D. To stress the point Howard used the tagline "J.R. in 3D.  Itll knock both your eyes out!" as part of the advertising campaign. He also added the raunchy song and dance number "Lookin for Trouble" performed by Jane in a revealing one-piece outfit with three strategically placed cutouts.

The Catholic National Legion of Decency condemned the film and called for a boycott.  The Breen Office refused to give it a Production Code seal of approval.  Howard defied both by releasing the film without the seal. After the initial run he made substantial cuts to the offending scene, then re-released the film flat (without the 3D process).  Advertising changed the tagline to  "THAT Picture!  THAT Dance! -- youve heard so much about!"  The publicity surrounding the film guaranteed a success for both versions.

The uncensored dance sequence can be seen at  . This version appeared in the 3D release of the film prior to the drastic cuts made to appease the censors.

==The Critics Speak==
*  had no kind words to say about the film. He found it full of "Smoking room humor" and felt "To say any more about the cheapness and obviousness of this R. K. O. film would be but to give it more attention. And that it most certainly does not deserve." Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire.
*  called it "a rather mild, gabby, fashion parade in 3-D".
*  called the film "Loud, garish and trashy".

==3-D Films==
*The French Line was filmed in RKOs own 3-D process which they titled "Future Dimension".
*Bwana Devil - 1952 is often credited as the first 3-D film.
*Recent advances in 3-D films including    and   are opening a new era of 3-D filmmaking. List of 3D films.
