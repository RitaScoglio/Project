 Gregory Smith, Sarah Buxton. It was re-released on DVD August 21, 2007.

==Plot synopsis== Gregory Smith). Danny is a gifted, spirited athlete with something to prove. Worldly, old man Langer has turned his back on proving anything at all.

Langer and Danny seem an unlikely pair, but their relationship soon turns from young caregiver/caretaker to student/mentor to comrades on a quest to free themselves individually from life’s inequities and inevitabilities.

It’s post World War II. Danny’s father, Earl (David Strathairn), did not serve in the military and is considered a coward. Danny excels to overcome his father’s reputation while Earl is actually more a man than the town knows.
