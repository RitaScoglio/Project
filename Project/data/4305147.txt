Pure is a 2002 British film directed by Gillies MacKinnon. It starred Molly Parker, Harry Eden, David Wenham and Keira Knightley.

==Plot==
Following the death of her husband, 10-year-old Pauls mother Mel (Parker) comes to rely on an old friend, Lenny (Wenham), who is also a pimp and drug dealer. Soon Paul (Eden) must take care of both his mother and his younger brother. When Mels friend and fellow user dies, Paul must confront the fear that has been gathering in the pit of his stomach: having lost his father, his mother too may abandon him due to her heroin addiction. Even with his limitations as a child, he takes action to stop this from happening.  As this is happening, Paul befriends a pregnant Louise (Knightley), an older girl who is also a drug addict.

Most of the film was shot on location in east London with West Ham Uniteds Boleyn Ground (Upton Park) featuring prominently. As Paul is a West Ham supporter the teams anthem "Im Forever Blowing Bubbles" is a key part of the films soundtrack.
