==Plot== American war French singer, Lisa Garret (played by Maurey). They married and had a son, Jean. 
 Nazis for participating in the French Resistance and that his small son went missing during a bombing raid.

The above information was learned by the audience in a flashback, which is narrated by Wainwright. The war is now over and the grieving widower has returned to Paris to find his lost little boy. His best friend is Pierre Verdier (played by Dauphin).

Wainwright has been told that his son is living in an orphanage. He finds a sad and confused boy (played by Fourcade), who does bear a resemblance to Lisa, and Wainwright believes he might be his son. The Mother Superior (played by Dorziat) insists that the boy is his, but Wainwright is skeptical and sets out to test him. He begins to form an emotional attachment to the boy, but eventually, when the boy fails the test, Wainwright realizes that the child has been fed information in order to help him pass the test.  He confronts the nun, who confesses to having tried to help the boy because of her determination to see that the orphans are placed in good homes and have happy lives.

Though Wainwright and the boy have formed a bond, he cannot get over his grief until he speaks to a friend who advises him to face up to his wifes death.  While out and about, he has seen a stuffed toy identical to one that Wainwright had won at a carnival for Lisa, and which was named "Binky", and has bought it and sent it to the orphanage. The movie ends as Wainwright returns to the orphanage, having realized that he needs the boy he no longer sees as his son.  Jean, seeing the stuffed dog, hugs it and calls it "Binky", thus revealing that he is Wainwrights true son.
