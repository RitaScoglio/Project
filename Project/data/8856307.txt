Ōgon Bat
 
 
  is a Japanese superhero created by writer Ichiro Suzuki and illustrator Takeo Nagamatsu in 1930. Ōgon Bat is considered to be the first Japanese superhero.  Originally debuting in kamishibai (paper theater), Ogon Bat is considered a precursor to later superhero characters such as the Japanese Kamishibai character Prince of Gamma (debuted early 1930s) and the American comic book characters Superman (debuted 1938) and Batman (debuted 1939). 
==Character history==
 
Ōgon Bat made his debut in a kamishibai, a traveling show in which a sequence of pictures is narrated by a storyteller.  The character was popular enough to survive the decline of kamishibai following World War II and was eventually translated into manga and anime form.

A live-action movie, Ôgon Bat: Matenrô no Kaijin, was released in 1950, followed by another in 1966, simply titled Ôgon Batto, and starring Sonny Chiba. A 52-episode anime series was produced the following year, followed by another film, Ôgon Batto ga Yattekuru in 1972.

==Character overview== Egyptian sarcophagus to be awakened in the future to fight the forces of evil. Ōgon Bat has an evil counterpart known as Kurayami Bat (暗闇バット Dark Bat).

In modern times, Ōgon Bats sarcophagus is discovered by Prof. Yamatone and his daughter Marie in a tomb in modern Egypt. When Yamatones family is threatened by Mazo (マゾ), Dr. Nazōs main henchman, Marie starts to cry and beg for help. Her tears fall on Ōgon Bats body and reanimate him. From then on, he appears whenever Marie asks for his help.

His main antagonist is Dr. Erich Nazō (ナゾー), the leader of a crime syndicate bent on world domination who wears a black costume and mask with bat-like ears.
