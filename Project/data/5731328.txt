 Ali Haji). Luck follows RV and he is soon proclaimed the number one race car driver in the USA.

Tragedy strikes when RV is involved in an accident whilst racing and he is hospitalised for a few months. When he gets out, he heads straight to the track to race again but soon learns that hes scared of going fast because he doesnt want to crash and get hurt again. Every race he joins, he ends up in last place. His manager fires RV and finds someone else. RV tells Harry that he doesnt need him, he can find some other manager easily.

A year has gone by and neither RV nor Shonaa have jobs. They try their best to find work but no one will hire them because they dont have degrees. RV and Shonaa are unable to pay their loans and bills so everything they own in their house is sold. Princess and Champ worry that theyre becoming poor; RV says theyre actually on a reality show, Dont Worry, Be Happy. With about $2,000 left, RV and family leave their big house and find a less expensive one.

They move into a one-bedroom apartment, and the children become worried again. RV and Shonaa tell them this is all part of the game and the kids believe them. They still go to their favorite school while their parents try to find jobs.

A few days later, Shonaa gets a job as a piano player and RV becomes a taxi driver.

One night when RV and Shonaa start arguing, Princess overhears them and learns that they actually are in trouble with money. She then plans to save up the money she and Champ use for lunch. The kids dont eat, and Champ gets starved. He takes food from the garbage without his sister knowing and eats it outside of school on a bench. He keeps eating from the garbage while Princess keeps saving up money. Princess makes Champ promise not to tell their parents, knowing theyll get mad.

RV gets a customer who needs to get to the airport soon. He takes this chance as to test his racing skills. RV starts off doing great until he gets flashback on his accident. He then learns that he could probably never race again because of being scared of getting hurt.

Champ gets a piece of glass inside his stomach from eating something. RV, Shona, and Princess run to the hospital where Princess tells her parents the plan she made Champ follow. The doctor tell RV and Shonaa that they need $65,000. The couple has no idea how they are going to get the money and only have two days to get it. RV decides to enter a race for his sons sake. He meets his old nemesis and he starts remembering the flashbacks. But that doesnt stop him. He wins, while apparently killing his nemesis by pushing him off the track. In the end the family is living a happy and fun life.
