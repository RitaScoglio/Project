 1975 German road movie directed by Wim Wenders. This was the second part of Wenders "Road Movie Trilogy" which included Alice in the Cities (1974) and Kings of the Road (1976). The Wrong Move stars Rüdiger Vogler and Hanna Schygulla and notably was the film debut of Nastassja Kinski, who later played one of the leading roles in Wenders film Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas (1984), as well as appearing in his Faraway, So Close (1993). Kinski was thirteen years old at the time of filming.

The film is largely plot-less, with long carefully composed shots characteristic of Wenders work. The story follows the wanderings of an aspiring young writer, Wilhelm Meister (Rüdiger Vogler), who undertakes a journey from his hometown Glückstadt to Bonn, leaving behind his oppressive mother. Travelling from place to place  about West Germany, Meister gathers an odd cast of friends, and winds up alone on the Zugspitze. The mountain symbolized the distance he has put between himself from his fellow man. Nevertheless, he remains dedicated to becoming a writer. His thoughts are occasionally presented in voice-over. The road movie is a rough adaption of Goethes Wilhelm Meisters Apprenticeship – generally considered to be the first Bildungsroman ("novel of formation"). Cinematography by long-time Wenders collaborator Robby Müller.
