"Creepozoids was shot in 15 days in a warehouse in Los Angeles. I think the budget was something like 150k. It was a difficult shoot because of all the FX and monster sequences. Lotsa slime and very ambitious. Linnea Quigley starred in it and we had a great time working together. It was my first feature shot in 35mm. It was theatrically released and a hit on video."

Critical reception for the film has been mostly negative.
