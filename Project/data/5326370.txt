 Ben Lewis) in Chicago, but he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder complicated by the extreme guilt he feels about the Iraqi familys deaths. Little does Ted know that the terror has only just begun. He starts having visions of a burned man who wants him to right a wrong.

As Ted begins to lose his grip on both his sanity and his family, he seeks medical support for his post-traumatic stress disorder, but his financial situation does not allow him to pay for a treatment, and the government denies him. Ted enlists the aid of an equally unhinged psychic named Jake Witzky (Zachary Bennett) to help him understand his terrifying and relentless dreams. Jake encourages Ted to figure out what the burned man wants.

Maxs girlfriend Sammi (Tatiana Maslany) and their friend Luke (Shawn Roberts) get killed in a car crash that injures Max. This leads to a series of messages from the spirit haunting Ted, which reveals itself as the spirit of Farzan (Vik Sahay), an Arab-American college student who was beaten up and then set on fire. Farzan wants Ted to find his killers—whose identities shock Ted to the very core.

Sammi and Luke were devastated and extremely angry about the deaths of their fathers in Iraq. Max was angry about what happened to Ted in Iraq. That resulted in them becoming furious at Arab people. Farzan asked them for a jack so he could fix a flat tire one day, and they took that fury out on him by brutally killing him.

After a lot of thought, a heartbroken Ted turns Max in, against Mollys wishes. Max is locked up for a period of time, and Ted visits him.

==Reception==
Reviews for the film were predominantly negative, with Bloody Disgustings Ryan Daley writing that "It goes without saying that any Stir of Echoes sequel made without Koepp’s involvement is sure to turn out to be a real hack job, and this shoe definitely fits Homecoming."  Horror.com also panned the film, citing the films repetition and lack of suspense as some of the reasons the film disappointed.  Shock Till You Drops Jeff Allard criticized the film, stating "this sequel fails to show the same instincts for the genre, leaving it as just an echo of its far more accomplished predecessor."
