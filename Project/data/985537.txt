}} Gary Nelson King Solomons Mines.

The role of Allan Quatermain is reprised by Richard Chamberlain as is that of Jesse Huston by Sharon Stone, who was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Awards for "Worst Actress" for this role. The movie also starred James Earl Jones as Umslopogaas, Henry Silva as Agon, Aileen Marson as Queen Nyleptha, Cassandra Peterson as Queen Sorais and Chamberlains then real-life partner Martin Rabbett as Robeson Quatermain.
 Indiana Jones film series, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold was loosely based, mostly, on the book sequel of Haggards King Solomons Mines, entitled simply Allan Quatermain. In that book, which depicts Quatermains last adventure (although its just the second in the series of novels), the character and his associates go searching for a lost white tribe in Africa, and end up involved in a war between the rival queens of the kingdom. An opulent set was constructed for the movie just outside Victoria Falls.

==Plot==

After surviving their expedition to King Solomons Mines, Allan and Jesse have settled down in colonial Africa. They are engaged to be married and Jesse plans that they will travel to America for the wedding. But Allan is restless.

A man chased by two strange masked men emerges from the jungle, and is recognised as one of Quatermains friends. He is delirious and is cared for by Jesse and Allan, but at night, his pursuers return and kill him.

Before he died, he told Allan that his brother, supposedly lost, is alive, and that they have found the legendary Lost City of Gold. Quatermain immediately starts preparing for an expedition to find his lost brother. Jesse is furious and stalks off, but then realises how important this is to Allan.

Allan and Jesse are assisted by Umslopogaas, a fearless warrior, to put together an expedition. Swarma, a spiritual guru, and five Askari warriors, accompany them. The group crosses the Sahara desert; two Askari are lost when Swarma trips a trap that opens a pit under the road to the city. Another member of the party is lost when savage Esbowe warriors attack the group. Many spears get thrown at Quatermain and his friends, but Umslopogaas deflects most of them by with his giant axe.

Quatermain and his friends indeed discover the city. The inhabitants, both black and white, are friendly, and Allan meets his brother Robeson, seemingly in good health and at peace in the society. The city boasts two queens - white and black - but the real leader is an evil High Priest, Agon, feared by all.

Allan raises the population against Agon, who musters an army to recover the city by force. Allan realises that they can make all the weapons they need out of gold, which is mined by the population. The final battle ends when, atop the temple, during a lightning storm, the gold (in liquid form) flows off the side of the structure and pours over the attacking horde, turning Agons army into gold statues.

==Music==

The movie features just over half an hour of original music written by Michael Linn; for financial reasons, the producers reused material composed by Jerry Goldsmith for the first movie (although Linns score does use Goldsmiths main theme), supplemented with music composed for other productions from Cannon Films. 
 Making the Grade (Basil Poledouris), Doin Time on Planet Earth (Dana Kaproff) and The Seven Magnificent Gladiators (Dov Seltzer); in 2009 it was issued on its own album by La-La Land Records. Cues in italic contain material composed by Jerry Goldsmith.

==Reception==
According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received two positive and one negative review.      

==Controversy==
Based on a 19th-century novel that, though progressive for its time, reflected some racist attitudes, the film itself has been criticized for conveying some of these same racist themes. The book Africans and the Politics of Popular Culture provides a harsh critique saying it reached "levels of racism unachieved since the 1930s."  Though the film has been portrayed as a comedy and a satire not all critics have been satisfied that the racist themes are excused under this pretense.

==Releases==
MGM released the film on DVD on February 10, 2004.
