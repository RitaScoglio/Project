The Breaking Point is a 1950 American film noir directed by Michael Curtiz and the second film adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novel To Have and Have Not.   It stars John Garfield (in his second to last film role) and Patricia Neal.

==Plot==
Garfield plays Harry Morgan, a penniless fishing hire proprietor whose business is on the skids and whose family is feeling the economic pinch. He begins to work with a shady lawyer, Duncan (Wallace Ford), who persuades him to run illegal immigrants into California. Harry also begins a flirtation with Leona Charles (Patricia Neal).  When his plan with Duncan goes wrong, Harry comes even more under the influence of the lawyer, who blackmails him into helping the escape of a gang of crooks, who pull a racetrack heist, by using his fishing boat to get away from authorities.  Harry convinces himself that his illegal activities will financially help his family.  His wife, Lucy (Phyllis Thaxter), suspects Harry is breaking the law and urges him to stop for the sake of the family.  Harry refuses and walks out.  As Harry waits for Duncan and the crooks on his boat, Harrys partner, Wesley Park (Juano Hernandez), arrives.  Not wanting Wesley around when the crooks arrive, Harry tries to send him on an errand.  The crooks arrive before Wesley leaves, and kill him.  Harry is horrified, but is forced at gunpoint to transport the crooks out to open sea without drawing the attention of the Coast Guard.  Harry also learns that Duncan was killed during the escape from the heist.  Wesleys body is dumped overboard along with Harrys only firearm.  Harry uses a ploy to access a gun and kills all the crooks in a dramatic shoot out.  Harry, however, is critically wounded.  Authorities find his boat the next day and tow it to port.  Lucy rushes to Harrys side and tries to convince Harry to allow his arm to be amputated to save his life.  Harry reaffirms his love for Lucy and is taken to the hospital.  In the final scene, Wesleys son, who was briefly introduced earlier in the film, stands alone on the dock looking around for his father.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Bosley Crowther, the film critic at The New York Times, lauded the film when it was first released.  He wrote, "Warner Brothers, which already has taken one feeble swing and a cut at Ernest Hemingways memorable story of a tough guy, To Have and Have Not, finally has got hold of that fable and socked it for a four-base hit in a film called The Breaking Point, which came to the Strand yesterday. All of the character, color and cynicism of Mr. Hemingways lean and hungry tale are wrapped up in this realistic picture, and John Garfield is tops in the principal role ... Some solid production and photography along the coast and in actual harbors for small boats round out a film which is gripping and pictorially genuine." 

==Third film== To Have and Have Not novel and stars Audie Murphy in the Bogart/Garfield role and Everett Sloane in Walter Brennans part as the alcoholic sidekick, although Sloanes interpretation was less overtly comedic than Brennans.
