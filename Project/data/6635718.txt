Second half is OK."  Sify movies stated "Lakshmi Narasimha, the police story is being appreciated for its story, presentation and heroism of Balakrishna, the hero. It has taken a fantastic opening all over and is expected to be a long distance winner". 

==Controversy==
Balakrishna was involved in a shooting controversy. The incident took place on June 3, 2004 around 20:50 hrs at his residence in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad. The actor has fired shots at the producer B.Suresh and his associate, Satyanarayana Chowdhary. Later both the wounded were admitted into Apollo hospital.  The circumstances under which the case was handled led to much controversy as purported by the Human Right Forum (HRF). The HRF has questioned the authenticity of people who handled the case, and the circumstances under which the actor was shielded from police by giving refuge in the CARE Hospital with out any justifiable cause. 

The two victims have given statements before the magistrate alleging that actor has fired shots at them during their treatment in the hospital but soon they were retracted and made volte-face of their earlier statements.  The actor was arrested later on June 6 at around 3:30 AM and produced before fifth Metropolitan Magistrate. A show cause notice was also served on Bala Krishnas wife Smt. Vasundhara Devi (married: 1982) as the weapon used was licensed under her name and she could not give sufficient protection to her licensed weapon. But later the actor was granted bail. 

Balakrishna had lodged a complaint in February, 2011 with the Central Crime Station (CCS) police alleging that he was being defamed publicly on a website, www.ihatebalayya.com
