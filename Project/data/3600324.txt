Happy Times ( ) is a  ; the story appears in English translation in the collection of the same title translated by Howard Goldblatt. Though the story and the film share a common opening, they begin to diverge almost immediately.

==Plot==

In the city of Dalian, an old and laid-off factory worker (played by Zhao Benshan) seeks to marry an obese and divorced middle-aged woman (played by Dong Lifan), who he hopes will bring him warmth and comfort in life. So he sets out desperately to find a way to make money for the rich wedding he has promised to present. The hapless man and his friend (played by Fu Biao) decide to renovate a broken bus on top of a hill that is popular for romantic couples. He turns this bus into a small dwelling he names "Happy Times Hotel," which he will rent to willing couples visiting the hill.

As he brags about his newly opened "hotel" and how much money he is making, he finds himself entrusted with the care of the womans emaciated, blind stepdaughter Wu Ying (played by Dong Jie), who is unwanted in the house. Not willing to expose his scheme and ruin his attempt to get married, the man enlists the help of his retired co-workers, who agree to do all they can to make the lonely girl happy at her new job as a masseuse in the "hotel."

As the story unfolds, a touching friendship between the childless man and the dejected, orphaned girl under his care develops, leading to a moving and surprising conclusion.
