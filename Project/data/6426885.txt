==Plot==
  
Cheung (Andy Lau) is given four weeks to live. As he eats at a diner, Inspector Ho Sheung-Sang (Lau Ching-Wan), a police negotiator, has been called to the scene of a bank robbery standoff thats being bungled by his inept boss, Wong Kai-Fat (Benz Hui). Listening to a negotiation between Wong and the robbers, Ho feels that the robbers are professionals and goes in the negotiate with the robbers. After goading the robbers, a man amongst the hostages stands up and shoots the robbers dead. Inspector Ho recognizes his sniffling as the robber talking to Wong before he went in. As the police rush in, Inspector Ho leaves the crime scene to grab some breakfast.

Cheung has taken an interest in Ho, who he discovers was a former member Special Duties Unit|SDU. He then stages his own robbery to get in contact with him. He scares away the personnel of a finance company and takes the manager hostage. Cheung is met with another negotiator and Wong. When Ho finally appears, Cheung proposes to play a three-day long game. Cheung shoots the manager and Ho and the police give chase until Cheung stalls them enough to make an escape with a bomb, which turns out to be fake.

Cheung makes his escape by posing as SDU and a cop. Ho meets with Cheung after posing as a taxi driver. Amazed at Hos ploy, hell admit defeat at the game if Ho can take him to the police station before three days are over. Cheung then pulls a gun a starts shooting out the window to test Hos reaction. When Ho slams the brakes, Cheung flees and jumps aboard to mini-bus. When stopped at a police road block, Cheung avoids them. Having seen his gun, she cooperates. Leaving the road block, he gets off.

Meanwhile, a man known only as Baldy (Waise Lee) is having a diamond that he had stolen appraised by the old man who was taking pictures of Ho earlier. The two Americans who stole the diamond for him ask for more money. Baldy pulls out his gun and points it at the old man, who confirms its authenticity. Baldy then kills the two Americans and takes the diamond. Ho returns to the finance company for further questioning, and sees Baldy entering the office space next door. He tries to get in, but it stopped by one of Baldys men.

As Cheung watches a video feed of the vault at Baldys office, he puts a screw inside a box. As he takes a drink, he coughs out blood, meaning his condition is worsening with internal bleeding. Ho tries to reason why Cheung held up the finance company and not the jewelry or antique stores in the building and why Cheung chose him for his game. As he leaves for the day, Ho receives a Cheungs package. He meets up with his friend, the Head of Interpol, whos given him information on Baldy, whos wanted for possession of explosives, and one Peter Cheung, the old man who took pictures of him and appraised the diamond. Peter Cheung was Baldys boss until Baldy kicked him out.

More focused on the case, he skips having dinner with her to break into Baldys office. When trying to get in, hes turned away by security, whos told by Wong that hes not on the case. Ho sneaks in anyway as Cheung watches him on video feeds. Using a packet of dairy creamer he took from security, Ho enters the finance company and finds the grate that Cheungs screw comes from. Going through the vents, he finds men that Baldy had to keep an eye on the diamond and Cheungs video equipment, which Cheung uses to give away Hos entrance. Ho tries to escape, but Cheung calls him and leads him to an emergency door that turns out to be a dead end. Ho tries to pick the lock on the emergency door, which is opened by the guy who he encountered earlier when he tried to get into the office.

Knowing that Baldy will come down to get the diamond out of there, Cheung reveals a car identical to Baldys. Cheung takes the diamond, and Ho and Baldys men give chase. As both Ho and Cheung get fired on by Baldys men, the two are amazed at each others resilience. They work together to get out of the predicament, but Ho realizes that now hes the one with a gun and Cheung is the one driving. Cheung reiterates that if Ho can get him to the police station, he wins. However, Cheung drives the car into a wall. After the collision, both men try to get the diamond. Cheung walks away with it, but not before dropping his painkilling pills.

Wong, who thinks the pills are Hos, tries to talk to him. Hos Interpol friend comes and brings him more information on Peter Cheung, who died a year ago, and a photo of Cheung, his son. Cheung, who has been masquerading as his father, sends Baldy proof that he has the diamond and will give it back for $20 million HK. Ho meets with Cheung at the diner, asking why hes still playing with him even though hes got the diamond and has avenged his father. Ho gives him a minute to give him a good reason not to arrest him now. Cheung wants to have Ho arrest Baldy, but realizes that Ho isnt doing this for fame or a promotion. Cheung then taunts Ho, saying that hes beating Ho in their little game. Ho lets him leave so they can finish their game.

Cheung takes a bus, where he meets the woman from earlier again. The bus is pulled over by the police, and the woman invites Cheung over like before. She takes him to a restaurant, but he leaves when he starts coughing up blood.

Cheung has set the place to make the exchange for the diamond at a bowling alley, which is being staked out by Ho, Wong and the police. Ho bumps into the same henchman hes been running into, who still doesnt recognize him. Cheung has Ho make the exchange for him, but Baldy has Cheung, whos disguised as a woman, get the money. Ho tries to get Wong to check in on the money exchange, but Wong doesnt get the message. Cheung, whos taken out Baldys man and the cop while getting the money, takes off his disguise and makes the exchange himself, telling Ho that the "woman" is conning him. Baldy takes Cheungs bag, which holds a bowling ball, and throws it on the floor in rage, revealing diamonds inside. The police move in and arrest Baldy for stealing the diamonds from the finance company next door.

Cheung leaves the scene with the diamond and the money. Ho catches up with Cheung, finally arrests him and prepares to take him to the police station. Cheung reveals another "bomb" and pulls out another detonator like the one before. Ho calls him on his bluff and presses the detonator, which starts a timer on the bomb. Cheung, who knows hes going to die soon, wishes that he not die in a jail cell, so Ho stops and gets out of the car. The timer reaches zero, which starts up the car and Cheung escapes again. When Wong berates Ho for letting Cheung get away again, Ho simply ignores him and goes to grab something to eat. Cheung drives away, smiling.

Ho reads in the newspaper that someone using his name donated $20 million HK to a childrens cancer foundation. He hops on a bus and meets the woman Cheung kept running into wearing the diamond. Ho admires the diamond, though she brushes it off as something cheap. He asks who gave it to her, and she says she hasnt seen him in a while. Ho tells her to hold on to it.
