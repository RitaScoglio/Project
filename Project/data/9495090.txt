==Issues of trademark and copyright infringement== Michael Lucas trademark and copyright infringement against the La Dolce Vita mark.   International Media Films owns the rights to Fellinis La Dolce Vita.    The suit seeks unspecified damages and to stop sales of Michael Lucas La Dolce Vita Parts 1 & 2.  In May 2007, a Manhattan federal judge rejected the request to enjoin the sales of Lucas film, primarily on the grounds of "inexcusable delay" on the plaintiffs part. The judge noted that there were serious issues raised regarding trademark infringement or tarnishment, but also wrote that it "seems extremely unlikely that a hapless purchaser seeking to buy Fellini’s film will inadvertently stumble across Michael Lucas’s La Dolce Vita”, which would be an important element in proving IMFs case. 

Lucas won the lawsuit in April 2010 in a summary judgment by Judge John George Koeltl, who dismissed IMFs claims of copyright infringement, since many porn films have parodied mainstream films.
