==Production==
Producer Greg Smith said he wanted to make the film because he had always been a fan of John Buchans books and wanted to do a version of The 39 Steps which was "true to the period in which the novel was set, just prior to the Great War, when Europe was one huge powderkeg and nobody knew what a world war was." A New Film Version of The 39 Steps: Opening This Week The 39 Steps
By JUDY KLEMESRUD. New York Times (1923-Current file)   27 April 1980: D8 

Smith claimed "the Hitchcock version was about 20 percent Buchan and 80 percent Hitchcock. Our goal was to turn it around and make the film 80 percent Buchan and 20 percent invention." 

Smith says he chose Sharp to direct "because hes one of Britains best action adventure directors and he was familiar with the period." 
 Jesus of Nazareth.

The script did add a romantic interest for Hannay, played by Karen Dotrice. "You cant make a movie without women," said Smith. "You cant go through life without women." 

The film added a new climax with Hannay climbing on to Big Ben. Smith:
 In the book, the 39 steps lead down to a beach and filmically there is not much you can do with that. Today, audiences demand more of a grandstand finish. That was the major liberty we took - the ending. People can say, Youre not being true to the ending, as they stay away by the millions...   because it was an analogy we were working for - Europe was a time bomb in 1914. And we figured that the centre of European politics would undoubtedly have been the House of Commons. So we thought, Why not finish the film in the political seat of Britain?  
The film was the first in a series of films financed by Tony Williams at the Rank Organisation which was (temporarily as it turned out) increasing its film production in the late 70s.   accessed 16 April 2014 

"You have to go back in time to tell a story that doesnt have to face 70s problems," said Williams in 1978. "What people are nostalgic for isnt necessarily any particular period, but the happier values that are missing today." The lucrative case for believing in yesterday
The Guardian (1959-2003)   18 December 1978: 11. 

Williams defended the idea of adapting a previously adapted novel:
 The old films suffer technically against todays. The pace of modern films is much faster. The style of acting is different. Those old actors were marvelous, but if you consult the man in the street, hes more interested in seeing a current artist than someone whos been dead for years.  

A replica of Big Ben was built on Pinewood Studios. The idea of Hannay dangling from the hands of Big Ben came in part from a stunt performed by Harold Lloyd in the silent comedy classic Safety Last (1923). The privately owned Severn Valley Railway loaned the film a steam engine, together with authentic rolling stock and a section of track, for shooting. 

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack album was released on United Artists Records. In addition to cues from the film, Ed Welch composed The Thirty Nine Steps Concerto, an extended piece for piano and orchestra in a vein similar to Richard Addinsells Warsaw Concerto. Christopher Headington was the soloist, with the Rank Studio Orchestra conducted by the composer. It has not yet reappeared on CD.

==Release==
The film was popular at the box office.

Greg Smith said that John Buchans John Buchan, 2nd Baron Tweedsmuir|son, Lord Tweedsmuir, was pleased the film used more of his fathers book, and that he thought his father would have liked the Big Ben ending.
