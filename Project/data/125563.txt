Jailhouse Rock is a 1957 American musical drama film directed by Richard Thorpe and starring Elvis Presley, Judy Tyler, and Mickey Shaughnessy. Distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and dramatized by Guy Trosper from a story written by Nedrick Young, the film is about a young man sentenced to prison for manslaughter who is mentored in music by his prison cellmate who realizes his musical abilities. After his release from jail, while looking for a job as a club singer, the young man meets a musical promoter who helps him launch his career. As he develops his musical abilities and becomes a star, his self-centered personality begins to affect his relationships.

In April, Leiber and Stoller were called for a meeting in New York City to show the progress of the repertoire. The writers, who had not produced any material, toured the city and were confronted in a hotel room by Jean Aberbach, who locked them into their hotel room by blocking the hotel room door with a sofa until they wrote the material. Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, with an additional session at the MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics.

It peaked at number 3 on the Variety box office chart, and reached number 14 in the years box office totals, grossing $4 million. Jailhouse Rock earned mixed reviews, with most of the negative reception directed towards Presleys persona. In 2004, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

== Plot ==
Construction worker Vince Everett (Elvis Presley) accidentally kills a drunken and belligerent man in a bar-room brawl. He is sentenced to between one and ten years in the state penitentiary for manslaughter. His new cellmate, a washed-up country and western singer Hunk Houghton (Mickey Shaughnessy), starts teaching Vince to play the guitar after hearing Vince sing and strum Hunks guitar. Hunk convinces Vince to participate in an upcoming inmate show, which is broadcast on nationwide television. Vince receives numerous fan letters as a result, but Hunk ensures they are not delivered to Vince. Hunk then convinces Vince to sign a contract to become equal partners in his act. During an inmate riot in the mess hall, a guard shoves Vince, who retaliates by striking the guard. The warden orders Vince lashed with a whip. Hunk attempts to bribe the guards to drop the punishment, but without success.

Peggy follows Vince and persuades him to record a demo so that he can listen to himself. Vince records "Dont Leave Me Now (Elvis Presley song)|Dont Leave Me Now", which Peggy takes to Geneva Records. Unimpressed, the manager agrees to play the tape for his boss in New York. The next day, Peggy informs Vince that the song has been sold. She then takes him to a party at her parents home, but Vince leaves after he offends a guest he mistakenly believes is belittling him. (The guests were talking about progressive jazz, a genre that Vince hates as much as Presley hated jazz, which he could not understand, in real life.) Angry and offended, Peggy confronts Vince, who kisses her brutally, explaining, "Its just the beast in me."

 Jailhouse Rock".  Brett Farmer places the "orgasmic gyrations" of the dance sequence within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a "spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image";  it has often been cited as Presleys greatest moment on screen.   Alex Romero, who created moves inspired by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, choreographed the sequence. Presley was not convinced by Romeros initial choreography, so Romero played some music and asked Presley to dance, using his own moves to choreograph the final sequence.  Impressed with the dance sequence, Kelly himself applauded one of the rehearsals during a visit to the set.

===Critical reception===
 "|200px|thumb|right]]
Despite the success in the box office, Jailhouse Rock earned mixed reviews from critics. It was looked upon as scandalous once it was released because it portrayed Vince Everett as an anti-heroic character,   presented a convict as a hero, used the word "hell" as a profanity, and included a scene showing Presley in bed with co-star Tyler.  The Parent-Teacher Association described the movie as "a hackneyed, blown-up tale with cheap human values."  The New York Times criticized Guy Trosper for writing a screenplay where the secondary characters whom Mickey Shaughnessey and Judy Tyler acted out were "forced to hang on to the heros flying mane and ego for the entire picture." Cue magazine called the film "  unpleasant, mediocre and tasteless drama." 
 Loving You to "dangerously near being repulsive." 
 The Schenectady Gazette wrote that "its dear Elvis that gets the soft focus camera and the arty photography." Boyca remarked upon the low production costs of the film, and said that Presley was "in top singing and personality form."  The Gadsden Times said, "Elvis Presley not only proves himself as a dramatic actor&nbsp;...&nbsp; but also reveals his versatility by dancing on the screen for the first time. The movie&nbsp;...&nbsp;also contains Elvis unique style of singing." 
Look (American magazine)|Look favored the movie, describing the reception of an audience in a Los Angeles theater that "registered, loud and often, its approval of what may accurately be described as the stars first big dramatic singing role." 

Author Thomas Doherty wrote in his 2002 book Teenagers and Teenpics: The Juvenalization of American Movies in the 1950s: "In Jailhouse Rock, the treatment of rock n roll music, both as narrative content and as cinematic performance is knowing and respectful&nbsp;...&nbsp;The elaborate choreography for the title tune, the long takes and uninterrupted screen time given to the other numbers, and the musical pacing—the rock n roll builds in quality and intensity—all show an indigenous appreciation of Presleys rock n Roll."  Critic Hal Erickson of AllRovi wrote that the film "is a perfect balance of song and story from beginning to end".  Mark Deming, also a critic for AllRovi, wrote that Jailhouse Rock it was "one of   few vehicles which really caught his raw, sexy energy and sneering charisma on film." 

===Accolades=== ASCAP Award Jailhouse Rock".  In 2004, Jailhouse Rock was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, as it was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."  The film is famous for the dance sequence (also choreographed by Presley) in which Presley sings the title track while on stage, cavorting with other "inmates" through a set which resembles a block of jail cells. The sequence is widely acknowledged as the most memorable musical scene in Presleys 30 narrative movies, and is credited by music historians as the prototype for the modern music video.   Jailhouse Rock ranked 495th on Empire (film magazine)|Empire s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.  The review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an overall 79% "Fresh" approval rating based on 14 reviews, with a rating average of 6.9 out of 10.
