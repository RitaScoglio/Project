==Plot==
Five friends go to New Orleans Mardi Gras. On their way home, they get into a car accident and realize they have hit a man. Before anyone can call for help, an ambulance arrives. They are taken to a strange hospital where their injuries can be examined.

The plot centers on Mercy Hospital where inhumane experiments are being done on the living patients by an insane staff. The "experiments" are brutal, often killing the victim. In one set piece, the internal organs of a patient are hung like a garland over the autopsy table. The experiments are designed to save the head doctors wife, who has a terminal disease.

==Reception==
Critical reception for Autopsy has been mostly positive.   Fearnet commented that the film took a while to get started, but that "once Autopsy gets moving with its strange sense of humor and its admirable devotion to old-fashioned, over-the-top, Fango-friendly gore-gasms ... I have no problem calling it a weekend rental for the horror fans whove seen it all."  Dread Central and HorrorNews.net both gave mostly positive reviews,  and Dread Central stated that although the film "does have its fair share of pitfalls" it was overall "a living, breathing nightmare of a movie thats as sadistic as it is surreal."  In contrast, DVD Talk gave a more mixed review, writing that "Director Adam Gierasch shows some talent with a few sick set pieces and bursts of aggression, but some comatose performances, predictable jumps and a slightly aimless final third keep this in stable condition."
