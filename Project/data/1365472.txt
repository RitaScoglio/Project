Written on the Wind  is a 1956 American drama film directed by Douglas Sirk and starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone.
 Robert Wilders 1945 novel of the same name, a thinly disguised account of the real-life scandal involving torch singer Libby Holman and her husband, tobacco heir Zachary Smith Reynolds. Zuckerman shifted the locale from North Carolina to Texas, made the source of the family wealth oil rather than tobacco, and changed all the character names.

==Plot== alcoholic playboy baron Jasper Robert Keith). Spoiled by their inherited wealth and crippled by their personal demons, neither is able to sustain a personal relationship.

Problems ensue after Kyles impulsive marriage to New York City executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), who becomes a steadying influence to his life through the first few months after they meet. Kyle resumes drinking after being unsuccessful in fathering a baby. He turns against his childhood friend, Marylees long-time infatuation, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), a geologist for the oil company. Kyles anger and depression grow after the death of his father, who admires Mitch but is disgusted with the behavior of his two heirs.

Mitch is secretly in love with Lucy. He keeps these feelings private until Kyle, having been diagnosed with a low sperm count, physically assaults Lucy when she announces her pregnancy, wrongly assuming it to be the result of adultery with Mitch. Lucys fall results in a miscarriage. Mitch vows to leave town with her as soon as shes well enough to travel. On his return, a drunken Kyle recovers a hidden pistol and intends to shoot Mitch. Marylee struggles with her brother for the weapon, but it accidentally fires, killing him.

Repeatedly spurned by the man she claims to love, a spiteful Marylee threatens to implicate Mitch in Kyles death. At the inquest, she first testifies that he killed her sibling. But she tearfully redeems herself at the last second by admitting the truth. Mitch and Lucy depart, leaving Marylee to mourn the death of her brother and run the company alone.

This was the sixth of eight films Douglas Sirk made with Rock Hudson, and the most successful. Sirk reunited key cast members Rock Hudson, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone two years later in 1958 for The Tarnished Angels, his black-and-white epic about early aviators based upon William Faulkners novel Pylon (novel)|Pylon.

This title was one of the very few "flat wide screen" (FWS) titles to be printed "direct to matrix" by Technicolor, a process which was usually reserved for Technicolors "captive" processes, including Cinerama, Technirama, Techniscope, Todd-AO, VistaVision and a few other so-called "wide gauge" processes, and by which this specially-ordered 35mm printing process it was intended to maintain the highest possible print quality, as well as protecting the negative. Other notable examples of such FWS printing by Technicolor includes Giant (1956 film)|Giant. Universal must have expected this title to be a blockbuster, as was Giant, released just two months earlier, otherwise it would not have gone to the great expense of ordering "direct to matrix" Technicolor prints.

In the case of this title, the Criterion DVD has the motor and changeover cues erased, with the exception of a few reels in which these cues are still intact. These cues are the "legacy" Technicolor "serrated" kind, generally abandoned after 1955, but without the highlighting usually found thereupon. By the date of this title, most Technicolor cues had been changed to smaller round cues, which accommodated the significantly higher magnification which was required for FWS projection.

==Critical reception==
 ]] Freudian hysteria." 

In his review in the New York Times, Bosley Crowther said, "The trouble with this romantic picture . . . is that nothing really happens, the complications within the characters are never clear and the sloppy, self-pitying fellow at the center of the whole thing is a bore." 

TV Guide describes the film as "the ultimate in lush melodrama," "Douglas Sirks finest directorial effort," and "one of the most notable critiques of the American family ever made."
