== Plot ==
In 1748, England is infested with highwaymen, such as Will Plunkett, a London-based criminal working with a partner. However, very soon into the film his partner Rob is killed by Thief Taker General Chance, and Plunkett finds himself on the run from the local Policing in the United Kingdom#History|constabulary.

This incident was witnessed by Captain James Macleane, who was being taken to a debtors prison. He also sees Plunketts partner swallow a ruby, which he sees as his ticket out of debt, and, after narrowly escaping discovery by Chance, he goes to the cemetery and tries to exhume the body and retrieve the ruby.

Unknown to him, Plunkett is also waiting there, and he forces Macleane to give the ruby to him. He then also swallows it, as they are both found by Chances men. They go together to Newgate Prison, and Plunkett realises that, because of Macleanes social rank (he is a member of the gentry class), he can give the ruby to Macleane and he can use his influence to buy them both out of prison. This, despite protests from Macleane, starts a partnership which could be very successful, where they use Macleanes title to get to know the rich, and Plunketts brains and planning to rob them later on. However, this all goes haywire when Macleane falls for the beautiful Lady Rebecca and lets their secret slip.
 America are spoiled by Macleanes uncontrollable spending, and Plunkett leaves him to the gallows. However, Plunkett comes back at the very last minute to save his friend, and all three leave for British America|America. At the very end Plunkett gets his own back on Chance as he shoots him in the head in the sewer.
