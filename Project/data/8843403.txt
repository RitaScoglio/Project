==Plot==
Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) is an eight-year-old boy who dislikes school and fails every test or exam. He finds all subjects difficult, and is belittled by his teachers and classmates. But Ishaans internal world is rich with wonders that he is unable to convey to others, magical lands filled with colour and animated animals. He is an artist whose talent is unrecognised.

Ishaans father, Nandkishore Awasthi (Vipin Sharma), is a successful executive who expects his children to excel. His mother, housewife Maya Awasthi (Tisca Chopra), is frustrated by her inability to educate her son. Ishaans elder brother, Yohaan (Sachet Engineer), is an exemplary scholar and athlete, which Ishaan is frequently reminded of.
 physically disabled developmental disabilities, Nikumbhs teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaans work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia. On his day off, Nikumbh visits Ishaans parents and asks if he can see more of their sons work. He is stunned by the sophistication of one of Ishaans paintings, and tells his parents that Ishaan is a bright child who processes information differently from other children in his class, but Ishaans father is suspicious that the explanation is simply an excuse for his sons poor performance. Nikumbh demands that he read some Japanese text on a box and berates him when he cannot, giving him a glimpse into Ishaans experience of school. Nikumbh describes dyslexia to them and explains that it is not a sign of low intelligence. He tells them he can provide extra tutoring that will help Ishaan, highlighting the boys artistic ability evident in his many paintings and other creative works.
 list of remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.

Towards the end of the school year Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaans portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the schools permanent art teacher. When Ishaans parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaans father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan is getting into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh. The film ends with a freeze frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.

===Development===
The husband and wife team of Amole Gupte and Deepa Bhatia developed the story that would eventually become Taare Zameen Par as a way of understanding why some children cannot conform to a conventional educational system. Their initial work began as a short story that evolved into a screenplay over seven years. Deepa Bhatia later stated in an interview with The Hindu that her original inspiration was not dyslexia but rather the childhood of Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who performed poorly in school. Her goal was thus to explore the story of "a child who did not fit into the school stream." She referenced a specific moment in Kurosawas biography where he began to excel after meeting an attentive art teacher, and noted that this scene "became the inspiration for how a teacher could transform the life of a student". {{cite web

In developing the character of a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the childrens identities in the final version of the script. 

 

Khan and Gupte first met in college. Khan has said that he admired Guptes abilities as an actor, writer, and painter. Three years before the films release Gupte brought Khan to the project as a producer and actor. Gupte himself was to direct, {{cite web
|url=http://www.taarezameenpar.com/ |title=Directors Note: Official website for Taare Zameen Par |accessdate= 11 April 2008 }}  but the first weeks dailies were a great disappointment to Khan, who "lost faith in Amol and his capability of translating on screen what he had so beautifully written on paper".    Khan was on the verge of withdrawing his participation in the film because of these "creative differences",   but Gupte kept him onboard by stepping down as director. Had it been necessary to hire a third party, production would have been postponed for 6–8&nbsp;months as the new director prepared for the film. Keen to keep Safary as Ishaan—the actor might have aged too much for the part had production been delayed—Khan took over the role of director.  Taare Zameen Par was Khans first experience in the dual role of actor and director. He has admitted that the transition was challenging, stating that while he had always wanted to direct a film, it was unknown territory for him.    Gupte remained on set, "guiding   and, at times, even correcting  ". 

===Title and translation===
Initially the film was to retain the short storys title of "High Jump", because of Ishaans inability to achieve the high jump in gym class. This subplot—filmed but later cut—tied into the original ending for the movie. In this rendition, a "ghost image" separates from Ishaan after the art competition and runs to the sports field; the film would end on a freeze frame of Ishaan successfully making the leap. Khan, however, was unhappy with that proposed ending and convinced Gupte to rewrite it.

With the working title no longer relevant,    Khan, Gupte, and Bhatia discussed several alternatives,  eventually deciding on Taare Zameen Par. Possible translations of this title include Stars on the Ground  and Stars on Earth.  According to Khan:

 
Taare Zameen Par is a film about children and it is a film which celebrates the abilities of children. Taare Zameen Par is a title which denotes that aspect. It is a title with a very positive feel to it. All the kids are special and wonderful. They are like stars on earth. This particular aspect gave birth to the title. {{cite web

===Filming=== blocking the camera movement. 
 terrarium were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tanks water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film. Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary. Event occurs at approximately 2:45  The films next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the "absolutely petrified" Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor.  Ishaans nightmare—he becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowd—was filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set. To work around the train set pieces immobility, production placed the camera on a moving trolley to create the illusion of a departing train. For the sequences related from the mothers point of view—shot from behind the actress—Chopra stood on a trolley next to a recreated section of the trains door. 

All the school sequences were filmed on location. The production team searched for a Mumbai school with an "oppressive" feel to establish the "heaviness of being in a metropolitan school",  and eventually chose  .    As the school is situated along a main road filming took place on weekends, to minimise the background noise, but an early scene in which Ishaan is sent out of the classroom was filmed on the day of the Mumbai Marathon. The production staff placed acrylic sheets invisible to the naked eye on the classroom windows to mask the sounds of nearby crowds and helicopters.  New Era High School served as Ishaans boarding school. The change of setting was a "breath of fresh air" for the production crew, who moved from Ishaans small house in Chembur to the "vast, beautiful environs" of Panchgani. 

Production relied on stock footage for the brief scene of a bird feeding its babies. Khan carefully selected a clip to his liking, but learned three weeks before the films release that the footage was not available in the proper format. With three days to replace it or else risk delaying the release, Khan made do with what he could find. He says that he "cringes" every time he sees it. 

===Children===
Real schoolchildren participated throughout the movies filming. Khan credited them with the films success, and was reportedly very popular with them.  Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and went to great lengths to attend to them.  The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming.  New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and cooperation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school.  Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaans classmates gave up their vacation to participate. Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary. Event occurs at approximately 1:11:30  To fill out the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in.  A total of 1,500&nbsp;children were used for wide-shots of the films art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400&nbsp;students. 

New to acting, the children often made errors such as staring into the camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principals speech, but recognised that this would be a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to "bore the hell out of  ", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally.  A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and the childrens responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3–4&nbsp;days hearing the dialogue the childrens reactions were "jaded". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions.  The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was   deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in. 

Khan found it important that the audience connect the film to real children, and had Pandey travel throughout India filming documentary-style footage of children from all walks of life. Those visuals were integrated into the end credits.

}}  Khan gave claymation artist Dhimant Vyas free rein over the various elements.  The storyboarding took one and a half months and the shooting required 15&nbsp;days.  The "3 into 9" sequence, in which Ishaan delves into his imagination to solve a math problem, was originally conceived as a 3D animation. Halfway through its creation, however, Khan felt it was not turning out as he had envisioned it. Khan scrapped the project and hired Vaibhav Kumaresh, who hand-drew the scene as a 2D animation. 

Artist Samir Mondal composed Ishaan and Nikumbhs art-fair watercolour paintings. He held a workshop with the schoolchildren, and incorporated elements from their artwork into Ishaans.  Mondal also instructed Khan on a painters typical mannerisms and movements.  Gupte created the rest of Ishaans artwork and Assistant Art Director Veer Nanavati drew Ishaans flipbook.  The art departments designs for Ishaans school notebooks disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead wrote it himself. 

===Musical sequences=== speed ramping and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style.  The twilight scenes of "Maa" were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample—they planned to replace him with another singer—but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.

Ishaans truancy scene—he leaves school one day after realising that his mother has not signed his failed math test—originally coincided with the song "Kholo Kholo," but Khan did not believe it worked well for the situation. In his opinion, the accompanying song should focus on what a child wants—to be free—and be told from the first-person perspective instead of "Kholo Kholo s second person. When Khan took over as director, he opted to use "Mera Jahan"—a song written by Gupte—and moved "Kholo Kholo" to the art fair. Viewers of test screenings were divided over the truancy scene. Half thoroughly enjoyed it but the rest complained that it was too long, did not make sense, and merely showed "touristy" visuals of Mumbai. Khan nevertheless kept the scene, because he "connected deeply" with it and felt that it established Ishaans world.

}}  The chalkboard writings transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and "end the song on a high note." 

In writing the song "Taare Zameen Par," lyricist Prasoon Joshi followed the theme of "however much you talk about children, its not enough." Every line throughout the song describes children, and only one repeats: "Kho Naa Jaaye Yeh / Taare Zameen Par" ("Let us not lose these / Little stars on earth").  The song is mostly set to the annual day performance by the developmentally disabled children of Tulips School. Actual students from Tulips School and Saraswati Mandir participated, and were filmed over a period of five days.  The sequence originally featured numerous dance performances, but was trimmed down when test audiences found it too long.  A song accompanying the scene in which Ishaans mother is watching home videos of her son was also cut, and replaced with background music after test audiences expressed their opposition to yet another song.

Timing and other aspects are usually planned when scoring a film, but Khan chose to take a more improvised approach. Instead of using a studio, he and the trio Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy recorded it at Khans home in Panchgani, to clear their heads and not be in the mindset of the city. As they watched the film, Khan pointed out when he wanted music to begin and of what type. Ehsaan Noorani noted that this strategy allowed the score to have a "spontaneity to it." 

Different styles of background music were used to convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes.  The music of the opening scene—the recurring "Ishaans Theme," which represents the characters peace of mind—overpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after he snaps back to reality.  But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaans family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his sons dilemma. The almost seven-minute long scene scarcely used any background music, to slow the pace and make it seem more realistic.

Taare Zameen Par received several positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha suggests that the film is "a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions."    Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." {{cite web

However, there were some criticisms. Jhas only objection to the film was Nikumbhs "sanctimonious lecture" to Ishaans "rather theatrically-played" father. Jha found this a jarring "deviation from the delectable delicacy" of the films tone.  Although she applauded the film overall and recommended "a mandatory viewing for all schools and all parents", Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India believed the second half was "a bit repetitive," the script needed "taut editing," and Ishaans trauma "  a shade too prolonged and the treatment simplistic." {{cite news

===Scholarly response===
In his article "Taare Zameen Par and dyslexic savants" featured in the Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology, Ambar Chakravarty noted the general accuracy of Ishaans dyslexia. Though Chakravarty was puzzled by Ishaans trouble in simple arithmetic—a trait of dyscalculia rather than dyslexia—he reasoned it was meant to "enhance the image of   helplessness and disability". Labeling Ishaan an example of "dyslexic savant syndrome", he especially praised the growth of Ishaans artistic talents after receiving help and support from Nikumbh, and deemed it the "most important (and joyous) neurocognitive phenomenon" of the film. This improvement highlights cosmetic neurology, a "major and therapeutically important issue" in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology. {{Cite journal

Likewise, in their article "Wake up call from Stars on the Ground" for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna wrote that the film "deserves to be vastly appreciated as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life". They also felt it blended "modern professional knowledge" with a "humane approach" in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the "present age where everyone is in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading to a state of mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to perform. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of achievement and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" The film depicts how "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a "naive oversimplification" in the film. With India "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they "easily   under artistic license". {{Cite journal

===Public response===
The film raised awareness of the issue of dyslexia, and prompted more open discussions among parents, schools, activists, and policymakers.
Anjuli Bawa, a parent-activist and founder of Action Dyslexia Delhi, said that the number of parents who visit her office increased tenfold in the months following the films release.  Many began taking a more proactive approach by contacting her after noticing problems, rather than using her as a last resort. Gupte himself received "many painful letters and phone calls" from Indian parents. He noted, "Fathers weep on the phone and say they saw the film and realized that they have been wrong in the way they treated their children. This is catharsis." 

These reactions have also brought about a change in policies. The film, only ten days after its debut, influenced the Central Board of Secondary Education to provide extra time to special children—including the visually impaired, physically challenged and dyslexic—during exams. In 2008, Mumbais civic body also opened 12&nbsp;classrooms for autistic students. In Chandigarh, the education administration started a course to educate teachers on how to deal with children with learning disabilities. 

===Accolades===
 
 Filmfare Best Film Award for 2008,    as well as the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.    Khans directorial role and Safarys performance were recognized at the 2008 Zee Cine Awards,  2008 Filmfare Awards,  and 4th Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards.

}}  The music is mainly composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics by Prasoon Joshi. However, "Mera Jahan" was scored by Shailendra Barve and written by Gupte,  with the latter also composing "Ishaans Theme."   &nbsp;    Joshi received the National Film Award for Best Lyrics, and Shankar Mahadevan won the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for "Maa." 

Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama praised the variety of genres present in the soundtrack and the lack of remixes. He gave it an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it a "zero compromise album" that "stays true to the films spirit".  Planet Bollywoods Atta Khan rated it 9 out of 10, noting that the soundtrack "unquestionably lives up to all expectations". He felt that it maintained an "all round polished nature" and "is destined to become a classic". Although he, too, enjoyed the musical variety, he believed the composers overused the guitar and synthesizers.  Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the soundtrack a score of 3 out of 5, commenting, "Taare Zameen Par isnt your regular soundtrack about fluttering hearts and sleepless nights. What makes these delicate and whimsical creations special is their underlying innocence."
