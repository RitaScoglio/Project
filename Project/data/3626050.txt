}} fantasy adventure illustrated book Zathura by Chris Van Allsburg, author of Jumanji (film)|Jumanji. The film stars Josh Hutcherson, Jonah Bobo, Dax Shepard, Kristen Stewart, and Tim Robbins.

The film was shot in Los Angeles and Culver City, California and was released on November 11, 2005 by Columbia Pictures.  Unlike the book, the film contains no Jumanji material and does not mention any Jumanji events. The film was however marketed as a spiritual sequel with the tagline "from the world of Jumanji comes Zathura". The film was a critical success despite being a box office bomb.

==Plot== cryonic sleep as a result of one of the cards. The brothers realize that the only way to end the game and hopefully return to Earth is to reach the end space of Zathura.
 reptilian Extraterrestrial aliens called Zorgons. Another card brings aboard a stranded astronaut (Dax Shepard) who goes about eliminating the houses heat sources (during which Walter turns down the houses heating thermostat) and setting a couch on fire and pushing it outside into space to lure the Zorgons ship away with its heat signature (since Zorgons are attracted to heat).

As the brothers tension rises, Walter accuses Danny of cheating by moving a piece prematurely, but when Walter tries to correct it, the game reacts as if Walter was cheating and ejects him out of the house into the vacuum of space, but the Astronaut rescues him. On Walters next turn, he receives a card that allows him to make a wish, and considers making a wish to make Danny go away. The Astronaut quickly warns him that he and his own brother had played the game years before, and he too had received the same card. He wished his brother away, but this caused him to be stuck in the game forever without a second player. The brothers agree to work together to finish the game quickly.

Lisa wakes from her stasis, and unaware of the current events, turns up the thermostat. This causes the Zorgons to return, anchoring their ships to the house. The four evacuate to the upper floor but realize they have left the game downstairs. Lisa falls in love with the Astronaut. Danny uses the houses dumbwaiter to sneak past the aliens and retrieve the game. Danny manages to get the game aboard one of the ships, but is caught by the Zorgons when he attempts to get back on the dumbwaiter. Walter uses the "Reprogram" card to get the self-repairing robot to attack the Zorgons, and the aliens retreat. As the brothers continue to play the game, Walter receives another wish card. He uses it to bring back the Astronauts brother, which turns out to be Danny. The Astronaut explains he is an older Walter from an alternate timeline. Danny and Walter touch their counterparts causing them to disappear.

The Zorgons return to the house with a large fleet intent on destroying it. Danny makes a final move to land on Zathura. It is revealed that Zathura is a giant black hole that sucks up the Zorgon fleet and the house.

The three children then find themselves in the house as it was before they started the game on Earth, just as their father arrives home and their mother comes to pick them up. After they leave, their bicycle, which had been orbiting their house when it was in space, falls from the sky.

==Production== CGI in the film. "...its so fun to actually shoot real spaceships or have a real robot running around on the set, or real Zorgons built by Stan Winston. It gives the actors, especially young actors, so much to work off of," he said.  Dax Shepard, who plays the astronaut in the film, said that he would not have been interested in doing the film if the effects had been "CGI based".  Actress Kristen Stewart enjoyed the on-set effects, saying that, "When we harpooned walls and ripped them out, we were really doing it. When there was a fire on set, there was really fire," and that, "The only green screen I was ever involved with was for getting sucked out into the black hole."  Miniature models were used to create the spaceships, and Favreau enjoyed going back to techniques used in many earlier films such as the original Star Wars trilogy.  However, in some shots the Zorgon ships were computer-generated, and digital effects were used in many other shots, such as to create meteors and planets, to add computer-generated legs and arms to the robot suit built by Stan Winston Studios, to digitally augment the Zorgon suits (which were constructed so that the head came out of the front of the suit where the actors chest was and the actor wore a blue screen hood over his own head), and to create an entirely computer-generated Zorgon for one shot.  According to Pete Travers, Visual Effects Supervisor on the film for Sony Pictures Imageworks, retaining the stylized "1950s sci-fi look" from Van Allsburgs book "was a very important aspect of the effects". 

Favreau discouraged the notion that the film is a sequel to the earlier Jumanji, having not particularly liked that film. Both he and author Chris Van Allsburg (who also wrote the book of the same name upon which Jumanji is based) stated that Zathura is very different from Jumanji. 

The soundtrack to the film is an original score by John Debney and is available on CD. 

==Release== The Apprentice showcasing its family appeal. It was one of the last major films to be released on VHS.

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics; it currently holds a 75% "Certified Fresh" approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Zathura richly gratifies the fantasy of children; "not just to play a board game, but to project themselves into its world."
  Desson Thomson of The Washington Post wrote that Zathura has "an appealing, childlike sense of wonder." 

===Box office=== Chicken Little. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It ended up grossing just $29,258,869,  less than half of its $65 million budget. The international box office total was $35,062,632, for a total of $64,321,501 worldwide, just under the films budget. 

The plots similarities with Jumanji (film)|Jumanji may have been its undoing, with one observer referring to it as "Jumanji in space without Robin Williams". 

==Related media==
A board game was released by Pressman Toy Corporation that replicated as much as possible the gameplay of the game in the movie. Titled Zathura: Adventure is Waiting, the game incorporated the spring-driven clockwork card delivery mechanism, the astronaut, the Zorgons, the haywire robot, and the disintegrating house in various ways.
