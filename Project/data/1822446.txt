==Plot==
Woo (Smith) is an extroverted woman living in New York City, and she has a notorious knack for turning men into mush. When Woos psychic friend Celestrial (Girlina) predicts that the man of her dreams is about to enter her life, Woo doesnt believe it is true. Celestrial, however, is convinced that Woo is destined to meet a tall, debonair Virgo. Woos cousin Claudette (Paula Jai Parker) and Claudettes boyfriend Lenny (Dave Chappelle) plan to spend the night together but find themselves entertaining Woo instead. Lenny begs his best friend Tim Jackson (Davidson) to take Woo out - even though shy, strait-laced law clerk Tim is the polar opposite of the sassy and brassy Woo. That same night, Lenny and Claudettes night goes wrong when his sick obsession with chicken drives her to be forced to dress up as a sexy but awkward "chicken ho" (he makes her cluck and walk like a chicken) but she is allergic to feathers.
 chauvinistic attitude Italian restaurant, but Woos behavior gets them thrown out. They go to a dance club, where Tim becomes the victim, punched out by Woos ex-boyfriend. Woo likes a good laugh, and when Tim discovers the theft of his flashy new car, she finds this hilarious. And so it goes, straight on till morning.

==Reception==
The film was met with very negative reviews from audiences and critics.   It currently holds a 10% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews.  Derek Armstrong at allmovie, while giving positive reviews to stars Davidson and Smiths performances, stated that the script was "formulaic", and that the film in general was "not much of a vehicle for its impish starlet."  Made on a budget of $13 million, the film only grossed $8,064,972 domestically, making it a certifiable box-office flop.  It was, however, a success when released on home video (originally VHS, and later DVD).
