  silent propaganda John Reeds book on the Revolution. 

==Plot== Provisional Government, Provisional Government, intertitles marking the dates of events.

April 1917 Vladimir Lenin returns to a railroad station packed with supporters.

July 1917 The demonstrations in Nevsky Square are fired upon by the army. The government orders the working class to be cut off from the city center, and in a dramatic sequence the bridges are raised with the bodies of the Bolsheviks still on them as the Bourgeoisie throw copies of the Bolshevik newspaper into the river.  

The Bolshevik headquarters also is destroyed by the ruling class, and the Provisional Government orders the arrest of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin, who has gone underground but continues to direct the plans for the uprising. Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky is mockingly characterized and compared to a mechanical peacock and Napoleon, before satirically being accused of aspiring to the Russian throne. 
 General Kornilov advances his troops on Saint Petersburg|Petrograd. While the government is helpless the Bolsheviks rally to the defense "for God and country." The Bolsheviks take control of the citys arsenal and General Kornilov is arrested. Leaflets spread the messages of the revolution, and workers are trained to use weapons for the "last and decisive battle." 

October 1917 The Bolshevik Committee votes to approve Vladimir Lenin|Lenins proposal to revolt.

October 24 Lenin returns to the Smolny after four months in hiding and takes control of the uprising on the eve of the 25th. A message is sent to the people declaring the Provisional Government is deposed as of October 25 at 10 AM.
 Aurora sails in as the workers take control of the bridges. The Minister of War calls troops to the aid of the deposed government, and Cossacks and the Womens Battalion#1st Petrograd Women.27s Battalion|Womens Death Battalion arrive at the Winter Palace and lounge on the Tsars billiard table. The Provisional Government drafts an appeal to the citizens attempting to reassert its legitimacy, but that evening a congress is held including delegates from all parts of the country and the Soviets are voted into power. 

With the weapons and preparations by the Military Revolutionary Committee, Bolsheviks march immediately on the Winter Palace and demand its surrender. The Provisional Government, seemingly aloof, gives no reply. The Womens Death Battalion surrenders and kills their superiors. A group of Soviets infiltrate the vast palace through the cellars and locate the government forces inside. The Cossacks surrender and join the Soviets. At the congress, the Mensheviks appeal for a bloodless end to the conflict falls on deaf ears. 

The signal is given by a shot from the Aurora and the assault begins in earnest. In an epic climactic sequence, Soviets storm the palace en masse and overwhelm the defending forces. Soldiers in the palace raid the palace for valuables, only to have their pockets turned out by the Soviets once they have surrendered. Finally, the Soviets beat down the door to the Provisional Governments chambers and arrest the government members. Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko drafts a formal statement declaring the Provisional Government deposed. Clocks around the world are shown marking the time of the revolutions success as the Soviets cheer. 

October 26 The new government sets about building a new state, passing decrees for peace and land.

==Production==
  Red Guards, witnessed by 100,000 spectators, than the original occasion, which was far less photogenic.  This scene is notable because it became the legitimate, historical depiction of the storming of the Winter Palace owing to the lack of print or film documenting the actual event, which led historians and filmmakers to use Eisensteins recreation. This illustrates October s success as a propaganda film. 

==Style==
  the Buddha, Provisional Government, is compared to a preening mechanical peafowl|peacock. 

==Soundtrack==
In 1966, Dimitri Shostakovich wrote a new soundtrack for the film, which later appeared as a tone poem October Op.131 where Shostakovichs famous Partisan theme makes an appearance.  This soundtrack is the one used on most DVD releases of the film.

==Responses==
 
  as represented in the film]]
The film was not as successful or influential in the Soviet Union as Battleship Potemkin.
Eisensteins montage experiments met with official disapproval; the authorities complained that October was unintelligible to the masses, and Eisenstein was attacked—for neither the first time nor the last—for excessive "formalism (art)|formalism".  He was also required to re-edit the work to expurgate references to Leon Trotsky, who had recently been purged by Joseph Stalin.

In spite of the films lack of popular acceptance, film historians consider it to be an immensely rich experience&mdash;a sweeping historical epic of vast scale, and a powerful testament to Eisensteins creativity and artistry.   Vsevolod Pudovkin, after viewing the film, remarked, "How I should like to make such a powerful failure."
