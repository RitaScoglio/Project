}} 1980 comedy film directed by  Ira Miller and featuring Bill Murray. The film is presented as a series of movie trailers with titles such as The Howard Huge Story, Skate-boarders from Hell and The Invasion of the Penis Snatchers. The film was shot around 1977 and only released years later in 1980, probably to capitalize on Bill Murrays success as a box office film star.

The title Loose Shoes is taken from a 1940s Cab Calloway style song & dance number, in the films final skit "Darktown After Dark"; which satirizes an infamous 1976 racial remark: 
"Ill tell you what the coloreds want. Its three things: first, a tight pussy; second, loose shoes; and third, a warm place to shit.", Gerald Fords then Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz who was forced to resign.
