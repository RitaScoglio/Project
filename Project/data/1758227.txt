If they cannot come up with the money in twelve days, Bessie will be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

==Production==
The Seattle Center, including the Seattle Center Monorail and the Space Needle, serve as backdrops for several scenes in the film. Security officers pursue Presley and the girl through the fountains at what is now the Pacific Science Center.  The hitchhiking scene with Elvis and Gary Lockwood was filmed near Camarillo, California, as were some of the flying scenes. The entire hitchhiking scene to the point where they are both picked up by Kam Tong and Vicky Tiu Cayetano in the truck is easily recognizable as 5th Street near Pleasant Valley Road on the South side of Camarillo. 
 White River Enumclaw and Buckley, Washington|Buckley, now demolished.  The view in the movie was taken at the intersection of Mud Mountain Road and Highway 410, looking southeasterly.   You can see Mount Rainier in the background, which you cant see at this angle from the Wilburton Trestle.  The Wilburton Trestle is actually bigger than the White River Trestle, at six sections high.  The trestle pictured in the movie is only four sections high at the road crossing.
