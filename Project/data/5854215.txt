Love is Colder Than Death ( ) is a 1969 German black-and-white film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, his first feature film. The cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann and the cast as an ensemble won an award at the German Film Awards in 1970.

Fassbinder features as the petty hood Franz, who at the start of the movie refuses to join the Syndicate. He then meets the handsome young thug Bruno, who has been ordered by the Syndicate to follow him, and gives him his Munich address (Heßstraße 129). Bruno eventually goes to the address but is told he has moved; he eventually locates him through Franzs girlfriend Joanna (he is her pimp, but she talks about their getting married) and discovers he is hiding out from a Turk who thinks he killed his brother. Bruno offers to solve the problem by killing the Turk, which he does at a restaurant they all three visit; as they leave, Bruno also shoots the waitress. Franz is picked up by the police for both killings, but they have no evidence, so they let him go after a day. The three of them then plan a bank robbery together, but the police show up outside the bank and Bruno is killed in a shootout; Franz and Joanna get away in a car, and after they elude pursuit she tells him she had tipped the cops off about the robbery.  He says "Nutte"   and keeps driving as the film fades to white.   

The reception was generally negative, and the film was even booed at the 19th Berlin International Film Festival in 1969.  Today, it is seen as a fine example of Fassbinders early style, with a heavy nouvelle vague influence.

The film is dedicated to "Claude Chabrol, Éric Rohmer, Straub-Huillet|Jean-Marie Straub, Linio and Cuncho".  The last two refer to the main characters in Damiano Damianis 1966 film A Bullet for the General. Ulli Lommels styling (and also the poster artwork) is inspired by Alain Delon in Le Samouraï.
