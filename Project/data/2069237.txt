==Plot==
Diana Guzman is a Brooklyn teenager whose hot temper gets her into trouble at school as she repeatedly starts fights with other students. Her frustration stems from her unhappy home life; she lives in a public housing estate with her brother Tiny and their single father, Sandro. Sandro pays for Tinys boxing training in hopes of his becoming a professional boxer, although Tiny would prefer to be an artist. After visiting Tinys gym and intervening in a spar to defend him, Diana asks the trainers to let her box, too. She is told she can train there, but not compete in actual fights. When she learns that she cannot afford coaching from Tinys trainer, Hector Soto, she asks her father for an allowance but he tells her to get a job. She resorts to stealing his money instead and returns to the gym, where Hector begins to teach her the basics of boxing.

Dianas first spar is with Adrian Sturges, whom she later meets again when Hector takes her to a professional fight. Adrian invites Diana to dinner after the fight and kisses her after walking her home. One night after a spar which gave Diana a black eye, Sandro sees Diana and Adrian together and confronts her, assuming that she is in an abusive relationship. She storms out of the apartment and spends the night with Adrian. When he asks about her parents, she reveals that her mother committed suicide several years ago. When Diana returns to her apartment, Tiny offers to give up boxing so that she can use the coaching money he gets from their father.

Diana later goes to Hectors birthday party, but leaves when she sees Adrian getting friendly with his ex-girlfriend. When Diana and Adrian spar at their next session in the gym, he is reluctant to hit her, and she leaves before he can talk to her. Dianas first amateur match is scheduled against another girl, but when her opponent pulls out she ends up fighting a man, Ray Cortez. Sandro arrives in the middle of the fight to see the match end in Rays disqualification for illegal shoving. When Diana arrives home, Sandro berates her for looking like a loser. She retaliates by beating him to the floor and accuses him of abusing her mother to the point of suicide.

After weeks of rigorous training, Diana wins another amateur fight, this time against a girl, Ricki Stiles. Although Diana has accepted Adrians apology, tensions rise between them again when they learn that they both have advanced to the finals in their division to fight each other. Adrian refuses to fight a girl and Diana struggles to convince him to view her as a legitimate opponent. He turns up for the fight on the day, however, and after an even match, Diana wins with a unanimous decision by the judges. After the fight, Adrian fears that he has lost Dianas respect, but she tells him she respects him even more for fighting her, and they reconcile.

Kusama initially sought to cast a professional actor to play Diana but felt that many of those who auditioned were overly feminized and "polished" and decided to cast an untrained actor instead.    Michelle Rodriguez, who had worked as a film extra but had never auditioned for a speaking role before, attended an open casting call for the lead.  Although Kusama described Rodriguezs audition as "a disaster", she won the role because out of 350 auditionees Kusama "could not find anyone who could come close to her in physical power".  Since Rodriguez was not a boxer, she trained at Gleasons Gym five to six days a week for four months in preparation for filming,  as did Santiago Douglas, who played Adrian.

===Critical response===
Girlfight was well received by critics upon its release. It has a score of 87% on  , based on 34 critics reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". 
 David Denby of The New Yorker called her "a powerhouse star who could go a long way",  while Variety (magazine)|Variety critic Emanuel Levy described her as "a natural performer who dominates every scene".  In a review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott characterized Rodriguez as "a powerful, extraordinarily gifted young actress ... Remember the name."  The Washington Post  Desson Howe felt that Rodriguezs performance was the most memorable aspect of the film, and that she "becomes more appealing, formidable and beautiful by the scene". 

Karyn Kusamas script and direction were also highlighted by critics. The Los Angeles Times  Kenneth Turan commended her "craft, empathy and respect" and compared her to the character of Diana, writing that Kusama "is her protagonists double in terms of drive, commitment and ability".  Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly felt that, although the plot was clichéd and unrealistic at times, Kusamas direction showed "a clear, personal filmmaking style ... and a respect for her characters weaknesses as well as their moments of athletic beauty".  James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it "a well crafted and emotionally satisfying debut" and applauding Kusamas "single-minded determination and a passion for the project". 

Roger Ebert, who gave the film three and a half out of four stars in a Chicago Sun-Times review, enjoyed that the story is "always about more than boxing" with its deeper themes "about a girl growing up in a macho society and ... discovering she has a nature probably more macho than the men around her".  On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicle  Edward Guthmann opined that Kusama "ultimately undercuts her theme of female self-reliance by having Diana fall for Adrian" and criticized the plot for "tak  too much time justifying a womans right to be in the ring – instead of celebrating her achievement".

Girlfight was one of the first boxing films to portray women in the sport.    Film studies academic Katharina Lindner has argued that Girlfight was responsible for the "influx of female protagonists into the   genre" of the 2000s, specifically the 2004 films Million Dollar Baby and Die Boxerin (alternatively titled About a Girl).
