}} French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, but not released until 1963. It was Godards first film with Anna Karina, who starred as Véronica Dreyer alongside Michel Subor (as Bruno Forestier).

==Plot== FLN (National Liberation Front of Algeria), to prove he is not a double agent. Refusal and hesitation keep him from carrying out the assassination. 

Meanwhile, he meets and falls in love with Véronica Dreyer, who helped the FLN. Bruno plans to leave with her for Brazil, but is captured and tortured by Algerian revolutionaries. 

He escapes, and agrees to kill Palivoda for the French in exchange for passage to Brazil for himself and Veronica. However, the French discover Veronicas ties to the FLN, and torture her to death.

==Themes==
The situation in Algeria and the denunciation of the use of torture by both sides are the main themes of the movie. This led to the film being banned for three years in France. 

This movie shows a typical theme of Jean-Luc Godard, developed in his later works: interrogation about the nature of cinema (Bruno Forestier in the movie: "La photographie, cest la vérité, et le cinéma, cest vingt-quatre fois la vérité par seconde" - "Photography is truth, and cinema is truth 24 times per second") and the image (the photo-shoot of Véronica).

==Release== banned in France until January 1963, because of the presence of torture scenes. This was Godards second feature film (after Breathless (1960 film)|À bout de souffle) but was released as his fourth movie. This is the first of Jean-Luc Godards movies starring Anna Karina, who became his wife soon after the filming. She would go on to become the quintessential Godard actress.
