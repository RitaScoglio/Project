 1957 United British B picture crime drama, notable mainly for being the first major film role for future filmstar Sean Connery. Connerys role is that of a minor gangster, Spike, who has a speech impediment.

==Trivia==

* During filming, Connery was encouraged by fellow members of the cast to complain to the films director, Montgomery Tully, about his characters stutter. Not realising it was a practical joke, Tully apparently himself suffered from a similar handicap, and berated the young actor by allegedly replying, "Who the f-f-fuck do you think you are, L-L-Larry Olivier?"
