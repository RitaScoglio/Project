==Plot==
This Indian romance begins with Senthil (Cheran) setting off on a journey, distributing wedding invitations for his forthcoming wedding. Along the way, he encounters various individuals from his past, who bring back memories of three women that have had an impact on his love life.

"It is quite natural for students to get autographs on the last day of their school and college life. But how many of them flip through the autograph book and rewind their memories in the later stages of their life. Autograph, a film, is one such attempt made by director Cheran to rewind the memories of his early childhood and youthful days with spotlight on his romantic escapades. Interestingly with no cinematic touches, Autograph is sure to delight one and all to recall their memories and enjoy the past."

The movie begins with Senthil, who runs an advertising agency, boarding a train to visit his native village to invite all his friends for his wedding.

The journey to his childhood days begins there. The happenings in the school, his tussle with his friends and his first love with his classmate, Kamala (Mallika (actress)|Mallika), are all pictured realistically. Senthil reaches the village and invites all including Kamala, who promises to come to the wedding, with her husband and three children.

Then, he goes to Kerala where he had his college education. His major crush at that time was Lathika (Gopika), a Malayalee girl, with whom he falls in love but later the affair proves to be short- lived as her parents marry her off to her cousin, Madhavan. On reaching Kerala to invite her, Cheran is shattered to see his lover as a widow.

Meanwhile, he is dejected at the failure of his love affair then and he comes across a trusted friend Divya (Sneha (actress)|Sneha), who instils confidence, unearths his hidden talents and teaches him the lesson that one has to go ahead in life without looking back. However, she does not reveal the tragedy that occurred in her past. But as time passes by, she reveals that her mother is a paralytic patient and that she now has to work for survival. While she and Senthil travel on a bus, she reveals that she was in love with someone and believed that he was a good man but got cheated. A poetic narration on the need for a good friend has been stressed.

Towards the end, Senthil gets married to a girl of his parents choice, Thenmozhi (Kanika (actress)|Kanika), and all the three girls, who had played a part in his life, and many college friends attend the wedding.Also he sets a very nice ending to the main story.
