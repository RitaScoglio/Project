==Plot==
Count Christian von Meruh (Udo Kier) is a witch hunter and apprentice to Lord Cumberland (Herbert Lom) in early eighteenth-century Austria. He believes strongly in his mentor and the ways of the church but loses faith when he catches Cumberland strangling a man to death for calling him impotent. Von Meruh begins to see for himself that the witch trials are nothing but a scam of the church to rob people of their land, money, and other personal belongings of value and seduce beautiful women. Eventually, the townspeople revolt, and Cumberland escapes but von Meruh is captured by the townspeople. This film contains very strong graphic torture including a womens tongue being ripped out of her head, nuns being raped, and multitudes of beatings.

==Production== Michael Armstrongs Witchfinder General.

The production was filmed during the summer of 1969 in Austria. From the beginning production was difficult, including that at least half a dozen languages were spoken on set, which caused problems for the cast and crew. Producer Adrian Hoven and director Michael Armstrong disliked each other intensely and often argued over the slightest of things. Hoven made sure a small number of the scripts were kept on set and even cut some of Armstrongs footage, so his own ideas could be inserted in the film. Because cinematographer Ernst W. Kalinke was a friend of Hovens, they would both film scenes without Armstrongs permission. It has been debated   how much of Mark of the Devil was filmed by Armstrong and what by Hoven. To give the film some historical accuracy, it was filmed in an Austrian castle where actual witchfinding interrogations had taken place. This castle also served as a museum with authentic torture tools that were used in the film.

==Reception==
 
The film was more successful at the box office than Witchfinder General and this success is often attributed to the aforementioned advertising campaign. The film has been criticized by many reviewers for being too violent to contain any message and far too exploitative whilst dealing with a serious historical subject. Other reviews praise the film for its filming locations, consisting of the mountainous Austrian countryside and stately castles.

The University of Viennas film studies conference   was held on 3–5 April 2014.

==Release== uncut on Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom and United States.  The release featured the High Rising Productions documentary film Mark of the Times and a special featurete over the distributor Hallmark Releasing with the docu Hallmark of the Devil. 

==Sequel==
Producer Hoven delivered the official sequel,  . In addition, several VHS companies sought to exploit the titles notoriety by retitling several unrelated European horror films as sequels (including films from the popular Tombs of the Blind Dead#Films in the Blind Dead series|Blind Dead series).
