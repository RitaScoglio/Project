==Reception==
Anthony Perkins was nominated for best supporting actor of the year by the National Society of Film Critics.

Paul Newman called it "the most significant film Ive ever made and the best." 
 The Balcony, The Manchurian Candidate. ... Despite its obsession with collecting evidence, and its handy school of pseudo-documentary, WUSA fights unreal battles with an unseen enemy. Lacking either the grace of art of the vitality of guerrilla theater, it can offer only the coarsest nourishmentâ€”and only to the elaborately self-deceived."
