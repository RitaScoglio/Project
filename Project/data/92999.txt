 American Hero. The film stars Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro, with Anne Heche, Denis Leary, and William H. Macy in supporting roles.
 spin doctor (De Niro) distracts the electorate from a sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood film producer (Hoffman) to construct a fake war with Albania.

The film was released one month before the outbreak of the  Lewinsky scandal and the subsequent bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan by the Clinton Administration, which prompted the media to draw comparisons between the film and reality. 

==Plot== Election Day. Conrad Brean (De Niro), a top-notch spin doctor, is brought in to take the publics attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a fake war with Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Hoffman) to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a photogenic orphan (Dunst) in Albania.
 Pentagon provide him with a soldier named Schumann (Harrelson) around whom he constructs a further narrative including t-shirts, additional patriotic songs, and faux-grassroots demonstrations of patriotism.  At each stage of the plan, Motss continually dismisses setbacks as "nothing" and compares them to past movie-making catastrophes he averted.  
 criminally insane Army prison convict before their plane crashes en route to Andrews Air Force Base.  The team survives and is rescued by a farmer, but Schumann attempts to rape the farmers daughter and the farmer kills him.  Motss then stages an elaborate military funeral, claiming that Schumann died from wounds sustained during his rescue.

While watching a political talk show Motss gets frustrated that the media are crediting the presidents win to a tired campaign slogan of "Dont change horses in mid-stream" rather than Motsss hard work. Despite previously claiming he was inspired by the challenge, Motss announces that he wants credit and will reveal his involvement, despite Breans warning that he is "playing with his life". Motss refuses to back down, so Brean reluctantly has him killed and makes it look as if he had a heart attack. The president is successfully re-elected and a news report about a violent incident in Albania is shown, but it is ambiguous whether this is a true event or simply a continuation of the fictional war.

==Writing credits==
The award of writing credits on the film became controversial at the time, due to objections by Barry Levinson. After Levinson became attached as director, David Mamet was hired to rewrite Hilary Henkins screenplay, which was loosely adapted from Larry Beinharts novel American Hero.

Given the close relationship between Levinson and Mamet, New Line Cinema asked that Mamet be given sole credit for the screenplay. However, the Writers Guild of America intervened on Henkins behalf to assure that Henkin received first-position shared screenplay credit, finding that—as the original screenwriter—Henkin had created the screenplays structure as well as much of the screen story and dialogue. 

Levinson thereafter threatened to (but did not) quit the Guild, claiming that Mamet had written all of the dialogue as well as creating the characters of Motss and Schumann, and had originated most of the scenes set in Hollywood and all of the scenes set in Nashville. Levinson attributed the numerous similarities between Henkins original version and the eventual shooting script to Henkin and Mamet working from the same novel, but the WGA disagreed in its credit arbitration ruling. 

==Music==
 

The film featured many songs created for the fictitious campaign waged by the protagonists; these songs include "Good Old Shoe", "The American Dream", and "The Men of the 303". However, none of these pieces made it onto the soundtrack CD. The CD featured only the title track (by British guitarist/vocalist Mark Knopfler) and seven of Knopflers instrumentals.

==Reception== normalized rating system, the film earned a favorable rating of 73/100 based on 22 reviews by mainstream critics.    Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars and wrote in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, "The movie is a satire that contains just enough realistic ballast to be teasingly plausible; like Dr. Strangelove, it makes you laugh, and then it makes you wonder." {{Cite news
