==Plot summary==
 
Brendan OMalley (Douglas) crosses the border into Mexico to escape justice for a murder. He arrives at the ranch of a former lover, Belle Breckenridge (Malone) and her husband, the drunkard and coward John Breckenridge (Joseph Cotten).

OMalley meets her daughter Melissa (Carol Lynley). He is immediately attracted to Missy, who reminds him of Belle when they were lovers years ago. Breckenridge, meanwhile, hires OMalley to drive his herd to Texas.

Sheriff Dana Stribling (Hudson) is pursuing OMalley. He arrives at the ranchero to serve a warrant for the murder of his brother-in-law.

Stribling does not have jurisdiction to arrest OMalley in Mexico so he also agrees to join the cattle drive to Texas. He promises to deliver OMalley to the law upon their arrival. 

During the cattle drive some former Confederates confront Breckenridge in a bar and accuse him of cowardice during a battle in the Civil War. Although Stribling and OMalley team up to try and save Breckenridges life, he is shot and killed trying to leave the bar. Stribling and OMalley respond by shooting the men who killed him, and then they bury his remains. 

Along the journey, Stribling and Belle become attracted to each other and plan to marry, and OMalley and Missy fall in love, increasing the tension between the sheriff and the outlaw.

On the eve of the showdown between the two men, Belle discloses the secret that Missy is the daughter of OMalley and their incestuous love cannot continue. At the gunfight, OMalley faces the sheriff with an unloaded gun, effectively committing suicide.
