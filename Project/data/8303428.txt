==Production== The Rape of Nanking after seeing the obituary for the books author, Iris Chang. The book inspired Leonsis to research the massacre further and eventually led to his creation of the film project.

Leonsis had expressed his desire for the film to be released theatrically, as well as on DVD, television, and Cable television|cable. He hopes to use local DVD sales as an advertising platform for businesses that want to break into the Chinese market.    He also expressed interest in making the film available for free online, saying "Well get a sponsor", "Im not worried about piracy. I want people to share the movie."   

==Release and reaction==
Nanking has received numerous positive reviews, including one from Reuters that says that the "beautifully crafted film...honors the highest calling of documentary filmmaking."  It was accepted to the Sundance Film Festival in January, 2007 and nominated for the Grand Jury Prize (Documentary); the film was awarded honors for Documentary Editing.  In 2008, this documentary was awarded the Peabody Award.  Japanese right-wing nationalist  filmmaker Satoru Mizushima called the film a "setup by China to control intelligence," and plans to release his own documentary, The Truth about Nanjing, in which the massacre is portrayed as merely political propaganda.  On his blog, Nanking producer Ted Leonsis responded by saying: "Our film isnt an anti-Japanese film. It is an anti-war film." 

In July 2007, the film premiered in Beijing and opened in Peoples Republic of China|China.  According to BBC News, it is unlikely that the film will ever be shown in Japan. 

On November 19, 2007, Nanking was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as one of 15 films on its documentary feature Oscar shortlist.  It was not retained when the list was narrowed to the final five nominations.
