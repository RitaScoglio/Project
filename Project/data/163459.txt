 crime drama NYPD officer Frank Serpico, who went undercover to expose corruption in the police force. Both Maass book and the film cover 12 years, 1960 to June 15, 1972. 

The film and principals were nominated for numerous awards, earning recognition for its score, direction, screenplay, and Pacinos performance. The film was also a commercial success.

== Plot ==
Working as a uniformed patrolman, Frank Serpico excels at every assignment. He moves on to plainclothes assignments, where he slowly discovers a hidden world of corruption and graft among his own colleagues. After witnessing cops commit violence, take payoffs, and other forms of police corruption, Serpico decides to expose what he has seen, but is harassed and threatened by his peers. His struggle leads to infighting within the police force, problems in his personal relationships, and his life being threatened. Finally, after being shot in the face during a drug bust on February 3, 1971, he testifies before the Knapp Commission, a government inquiry into NYPD police corruption between 1970 and 1972. After receiving a New York City Police Department Medal of Honor and a disability pension, Serpico resigns from the force and moves to Switzerland.

==Production==
Prior to any work on the movie, producer Martin Bregman had lunch with Peter Maas to discuss a film adaptation of his biography of Frank Serpico. Waldo Salt, a screenwriter, began to write the script which director Sidney Lumet deemed to be too long.  Another screenwriter, Norman Wexler, did the structural work followed by play lines.

Director John G. Avildsen was originally slated to direct the movie, but was removed from production due to differences with producer Bregman. Lumet took the helm as director just before filming.
 
The real-life Frank Serpico wished to be present during the filming of the movie and was initially allowed to stay, but was eventually dismissed from the set, as Lumet was worried that his presence would make the actors (particularly Pacino) self-conscious. 

The story was filmed in New York City. A total of 104 different locations in four of the five boroughs of the city (all except Staten Island) were used.  An apartment at 5-7 Minetta Street in Manhattans Greenwich Village was used as Serpicos residence, though according to the book, he lived on Perry Street during the events depicted in the film. Lewisohn Stadium, which was closed at the time of filming, was used for one scene.

As the storyline needed to show the progression of Serpicos beard and hair length, individual scenes were filmed in reverse order, with Pacinos hair being trimmed for each scene set earlier in the films timeline.
