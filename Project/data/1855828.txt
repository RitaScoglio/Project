==Plot== aboriginal players.

In an isolated South Australian fishing town, the only thing that connects the black and white communities is football. Gary Black (Nathan Phillips) and Dumby Red (Luke Carroll) are an exception; teenage best friends from different sides of the tracks. Dumby is the star of the football team and likely to become the next big Aboriginal star in the big leagues. Gary is the bookish son of hard-drinking and brutal white fisherman Bob Black (Simon Westaway). He is attracted to Dumbys beautiful sister, Clarence (Lisa Flanagan). When their team wins the premiership, Dumbys elation is short-lived. He is passed over for the best-on-ground prize. Disgruntled, Dumby and his cousin attempt to rob the bar where the celebrations were held, hoping to find the best-on-ground prize. After breaking into the bar, they meet the drunk owner, beat him into unconsciousness and proceed to the safe with the key found in his pocket. Bob, waking to find the owner unconscious with head wound, heads to the office and loads a double-barrelled shotgun. Bob sneaks up behind Dumby and fires two bullets into the figure in the darkness. Bob discovers he has killed Dumby and reloads the shotgun before Dumbys cousin, whos been hiding behind the door, jumps him and points the gun at his neck. Dumbys cousin reveals himself by removing his makeshift balaclava. He doesnt shoot Bob but fires two rounds into the ceiling and runs away into the darkness.
