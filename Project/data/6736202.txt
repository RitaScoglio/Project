 Corey Johnson, Velibor Topic  and Danny Dyer. It is written and directed by Gavin Claxton. 

==Plot==

Martin Freeman plays frustrated TV producer Chris, a self-opinionated wannabe screenwriter (with a particular dislike of British films featuring quirky secondary characters and plastic gangsters) who is forced to leave his unreliable flatmate Bob played by Velibor Topic in charge of showing a series of estate agents around the house he is trying to sell.  Worried by Bobs habit of spending all day "working" in the basement playing loud music, Chris asks his friend to listen out for the door bell and show anyone who comes calling inside.  Bob promises to do exactly that and for once, not to let him down. 
 Richard Harrington Corey Johnson.

That evening, Chris is surprised to return home and find his flatmate, four estate agents, two Jehovahs Witnesses and a terrified childrens entertainer being held hostage by a couple of characters straight out of a British gangster film.
