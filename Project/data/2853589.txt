== Critical reception == Allmovie called it an "outrageous sleazefest" and "amazingly racist". 

==Censorship==
  British theatrical release in 1981,  but a video release the following year allowed the public brief access to the film before it wound up on the video nasties list and was outlawed.  It is notable for being the only video nasty to appear on the list due to language, specifically the racism displayed by Sandersons character.
