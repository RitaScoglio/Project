Screenwriter Gilroys experience making the film inspired him to write and direct the film Once in Paris (1978), which focused on his chauffeur during the Only Game shoot. Gilroy was so fascinated by the man he cast the driver as himself.
 Lucky You (2007), which dealt with a professional gambler out to break the bank in Las Vegas. The reworking was in the adding of a female singer and the gamblers father entering a Vegas gambling convention where the story is set. The film starred Eric Bana, Drew Barrymore and Robert Duvall.

==Critical reception==
Opening in 1970 to mixed reviews and little money, this became the last film for George Stevens, leading him to retire from directing altogether.

In his March 5, 1970, review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby stated, "Assigning   to the film version of Frank D. Gilroys small, sentimental, Broadway flop is rather like trying to outfit a leaky Central Park rowboat for a celebrity cruise through the Greek islands. The result is a phenomenological disaster . . . Nothing in The Only Game in Town seems quite on the up and up. Everything, including both the humor and the pathos, is bogus."  

In an undated review, Time Out London called it "a hoarily old-fashioned romantic comedy ...   occasional moments of life injected by Taylor and Beatty."  

TV Guide said, in an undated review, "Although some of the dialog sparkles, in general,   is overly talkly and thinly plotted, a programmer dressed up in ermine."
