==Plot== medium who realizes she has an actual gift when she can hear Sam. He convinces her of the danger that Molly is in and to warn her. She is met by scepticism until she relays information that only Sam would know.
 launder the excess money from the bank accounts. Meeting a violent poltergeist, Sam convinces him to teach him how to manipulate objects physically. After learning to harness this ability, he approaches Oda Mae and advises her to withdraw the money in the fake name that Carl had set up, then give the $4 million to charity to prevent being caught. Sam tries to scare Carl away from Molly, but she lets it slip that Oda Mae was at the bank, and Carl pieces it together. Sam prevents Oda Mae from being caught by Willie by terrorizing him and sending him into oncoming traffic. Willie is killed by the traffic, and his ghost is grabbed by creatures in the shadows that drag him into the ground screaming. Returning to the apartment, Sam convinces Molly that Oda Mae is telling the truth about him by floating a penny to her.

Oda Mae allows Sam to possess her body, so he and Molly can share a slow dance, but Carl interrupts them and Molly and Oda Mae flee onto the fire escape. Carl chases the women to a loft under construction and catches Oda Mae. When Molly comes to save her, she is grabbed and held hostage. Sam disarms Carl and chases him toward a window. He throws a hook at Sam, which swings back and shatters the glass, and as Carl tries to climb through the window, it falls, fatally stabbing him through his abdomen. Carls ghost rises from his body and, as with Willie, he is grabbed by the creatures from the shadows and dragged off screaming. When Sam asks if the women are all right, Molly can hear him now. A heavenly light shines in the room, illuminating Sam, and they both see him. Realizing that it is his time to go, he and Molly share tearful goodbyes. Oda Mae tells him that he is being called home, and he thanks her for her help. Sam then walks into the light and onward to heaven.
