The Adventures of Robin Hood is a 1938 American swashbuckler film directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, and starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, and Claude Rains. Written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller, the film is about a Saxon knight who, in King Richards absence in the Holy Land during the Crusades, fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla army against Prince John and the Norman lords oppressing the Saxon commoners. The Adventures of Robin Hood was filmed in Technicolor.

In 1995, The Adventures of Robin Hood was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. 

==Plot== Richard the Ian Hunter), King of Prince John (Claude Rains) usurps the throne and proceeds to oppress the Anglo-Saxons|Saxons, raises taxes, supposedly to raise Richards ransom, but in reality to secure his own position.
 Sir Robin Lady Marian Fitzwalter (Olivia DeHavilland) that he will do all in his power to oppose John and restore Richard to the throne.  Robin then escapes, despite the attempts of Johns men.

Robin and his friend Will Scarlet (Patric Knowles) take refuge in Sherwood Forest and recruit Little John (Alan Hale, Sr.), after John trounces Robin in a bruising quarterstaff bout. Men join their growing band, the Merry Men. Robin meets and provokes the rotund Friar Tuck (Eugene Pallette) into a sword-fight. Then Robin persuades him to join his band of outlaws to provide them with spiritual guidance.  

Now known as the outlaw Robin Hood, he binds his men by an oath, to fight for a free England until King Richard returns. They are to rob the rich only to give to the poor, and to treat all women with courtesy, "rich or poor, Norman or Saxon." In a short time, Prince Johns cronies find themselves harassed and robbed.

One day, Robin and his men capture a large party of Normans transporting tax proceeds through Sherwood. Among Robins "guests" are Gisbourne, the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper), and Lady Marian. Marian is at first disdainful of Robin, but becomes convinced of his good intentions and begins to see the reality of the Norman brutality. Eventually Robin allows the humiliated Gisbourne and sheriff to depart Sherwood on foot, dressed in rags, telling them that they have Marians presence to thank for his sparing their lives.

Incensed, Prince John furiously accuses the Sheriff and Sir Guy of incompetence. The Sheriff comes up with a cunning scheme to capture Robin by announcing an archery tournament. The Sheriff is sure that Robin will be unable to resist the challenge. All goes as planned: Robin wins, is taken prisoner, and is sentenced to be hanged.

Marian helps the Merry Men to rescue Robin. Later, the outlaw sneaks into the castle to thank her. She and Robin pledge their love for each other, but Marian declines to come away with him because she believes she can help the rebellion better where she is.
 Montague Love) degraded former knight, is given the task in return for the restoration of his rank and Robins manor and estate.
 Una OConnor), has been romantically involved with Much. She sends him to warn Robin. On his way, Much encounters and kills Dickon after a desperate struggle.

Seeking Robin’s help, King Richard and his escort disguise themselves as wealthy monks and journey to Sherwood Forest. They are quickly accosted by Robin. When Richard assures him that he is traveling on the Kings business, Robin happily invites him to dine. Will finds the injured Much. Much tells Robin of Marians peril and that Richard is in England.  Robin orders a search. Certain now of Robins loyalty, Richard reveals his identity.

Robin devises a plan to sneak his men into the castle. He forces the Bishop of the Black Canons to include his men (disguised as monks) in his entourage. The plan succeeds. During the coronation, a melee breaks out. Robin and Gisbourne engage in a prolonged sword fight, ending with Gisbournes death. Robin then rescues Marian from her cell.

John begs for forgiveness, but Richard exiles him and his followers for the remainder of his lifetime (At least, until John becomes king.). He then pardons the outlaws, ennobles Robin as Baron of Locksley and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham, and orders Robin to marry the Lady Marian.

==Production==
The Adventures of Robin Hood was filmed on location in various areas of California and in Union, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. Don Beckman, the set director, built a replica of the set in Union, Washington. Today two  of five original cottages are still in use.
 Chico stood Robin Hood. Several scenes were shot at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios and the Warner Ranch in Calabasas. The archery tournament was filmed at Lower Arroyo Park   in Pasadena, California|Pasadena.

James Cagney was originally cast as Robin Hood, but walked out on his contract with Warner Bros., paving the way for Flynn,  although filming was postponed three years.   

It was produced at an estimated cost of $2 million, and was Warner Bros first color film utilizing three-strip Technicolor process.       It was an unusually extravagant production for the Warner Bros. studio, which had made a name for itself in producing socially conscious low-budget gangster films,  but their adventure movies starring Flynn had generated hefty revenue and Robin Hood was created to capitalize on this. 
 Stunt men and bit players, padded with balsa wood on metal plates, were paid $150 per arrow for being shot by professional archer Howard Hill.  Hill, although listed as the archer captain defeated by Robin, was cast as Elwen the Welshman, an archer seen shooting at Robin in his escape from Nottingham castle and, later, defeated by Robin at the archery tournament. To win, Robin splits the arrow of Philip of Arras, a captain of the guard under Gisbourne, who had struck the bullseye. An examination of the film images in slow motion led to speculation  that the arrow split may have been made of bamboo and had been previously split, the parts being held together with small rings. Buster Wiles – a stuntman and close friend of Errol Flynn – maintains that the arrow splitting stunt was carried out using an extra large arrow (for the target) and that the second arrow had a wide, flat arrowhead and was fired along a wire. Wiles discusses the scene in his autobiography, My Days With Errol Flynn.
