Despite failing to earn back its production costs, Slither received positive reviews and has become a cult film. 

==Plot== extraterrestrial parasite crashes into the town of Wheelsy, South Carolina. While frolicking in the woods with Brenda, local car dealer Grant Grant finds the parasite and is infected by it. The parasite takes over his body and absorbs his consciousness and memories.  With the alien now in control of his body, Grant begins to slowly change into a tentacled slug-like monster.

Many pets soon disappear, but Grant is not suspected. However, his wife Starla begins to question his health; he explains the initial changes in his appearance as an allergic reaction to a bee sting, saying that a doctor has already given him something for it, but Starla soon learns this is a lie. Starla contacts the police chief Bill Pardy – her childhood crush – who attempts to reassure and comfort her while not acting on his feelings.

Grant infects the lonely and neglected Brenda with hundreds of his offspring. He hides her in an isolated barn where she becomes massively obese to the point of inflating to the size of a wrecking ball as baby alien slugs grow inside her. Bill leads a small group of officers on a hunt for Grant; they find Brenda in time to see her explode, releasing hundreds of the alien slugs. Most of Bills group are infected by the slugs and become Grants Zombie (fictional)|puppets, speaking as if they were Grant and obsessed with bringing Starla home and holding her to her wedding vows.
 hive mind except Starla, Bill, mayor Jack MacReady, and a teenage girl, Kylie, who escaped a partial bonding in which she saw the slugs memories; it moves from planet to planet, eating or absorbing all life it finds there. The parasites consciousness, however, is influenced by the real Grants memories and his love for his wife, Starla.

The survivors try to escape detection and kill Grant. The townspeople attack their vehicle, capturing Starla and Jack. Bill and Kylie track Starla to her home, and find that the infected are melding into one giant creature. They must risk their lives to stop the infestation from spreading any further. Jack awakens in the houses basement, where several of the infected are eating; he tries to escape but becomes infected as well. Starla charms the monster by calling him "Grant" and telling him they can be together, but as they get close to each other, she pulls a mirror from her underwear and stabs him in the chest with the pointed handle. He slaps her with a tentacle and knocks her across the room.

Bill arrives; Jack begs to be killed, and Bill shoots him in the head. He tries to kill the monster with a grenade, but another tentacle knocks the grenade into the pool, where it detonates. The monster sends two tentacles to stab Bill and infect him; one is lodged in his abdomen, but Bill attaches the other to a small propane tank, filling Grant with gas, and Starla shoots the monster, causing it to explode, whereupon all the infected die. The three survivors walk away to find a hospital for Bill.

In a post-credits scene, a cat approaches to feed off Grants remains and is infected.

==Themes and influences==
Controversy ensued over the many similarities and plot-points shared with Fred Dekkers 1986 horror-comedy Night of the Creeps. According to journalist Steve Palopoli:

Palopoli then goes on to directly compare Slither to the aforementioned Creeps as well as Shivers_%28film%29|Shivers (1975). Gunn has stated that both Cronenbergs Shivers and his 1979 film The Brood were the two biggest influences on the story in Slither, along with the 2000 manga Uzumaki (film)|Uzumaki by Junji Ito. {{cite web | author= Elaine Lamkin| title=Slither: Writer/Director James Gunn Gets Sticky The Toxic Avenger.

==Home media== deleted and extended scenes, a blooper reel, visual effects progressions, a set tour with Fillion, and an audio commentary by Gunn and Fillion. Also included are featurettes outlining how to make edible blood, and Lloyd Kaufmans documentary discussing his day on set, and the shooting of his one line (which was eventually cut from the film). Finally, there is an added bonus entitled "Who Is Bill Pardy?" which is a joke feature made by Gunn with the sole purpose of roasting Fillion, and was shown at the films wrap party.

===Box office===
Slither was "a box office flop",    failing to recoup its  production budget     following its debut in the United States and Canada on March 31, 2006 in 1,945 theaters.  In its opening weekend, the film grossed $3,880,270 and ranked #8 at the U.S. and Canadian box office.  Slither grossed $7,802,450 in its theatrical run in the United States and Canada.  Slither also under-performed in France, grossing $236,261 from 150 screens.  The film grossed $5,032,486 as of February 6, 2008 in territories outside the United States and Canada for a worldwide gross of $12,834,936.    Its box office performance was substantially less than its total budget of $29.5 million, including marketing costs;    the production budget taking up about $15 million of the total. 

Paul Brooks, president of the films production company, Gold Circle Films, said the company was "crushingly disappointed" by the gross.    Universal distanced itself from Slither s poor box office performance, citing their distribution of the film as merely part of a deal with Gold Circle.   The Hollywood Reporter speculated that Slither s performance "might have killed off the horror-comedy genre for the near future."  Producer Paul Brooks offered this explanation about why Slither failed to catch on with filmgoers:
