==Production==
Sam Raimi and Guillermo del Toro were originally offered to direct End of Days, but both turned it down as they were busy with other projects. Marcus Nispel was set to helm the movie, but he left due to problems with both the budget and the script, and Peter Hyams immediately replaced him.

The role of Jericho Cane was originally written for Tom Cruise, but he passed as he instead chose to work on Magnolia (film)|Magnolia and Arnold Schwarzenegger was then cast. Liv Tyler was the first choice for the role of Christine York, but she backed out over contractual issues. Kate Winslet was initially set to play the character, but she dropped out and Robin Tunney signed on to replace her.

Peter Hyams later recalled:
 Jim Cameron was the kind of godfather of me doing that film, because of his relationship with Schwarzenegger. He told me I was doing it!... End Of Days was going to be Marcus Nispel, but it wasn’t working somehow, but they had Arnold and a start date, and Jim came to me and told me I had to do it. This was the first picture Arnold had made for a couple of years. I think he had a heart thing. So this was Arnold coming back. And he wanted to try to make something good, and to take some chances. I applauded that. And we had very, very good actors around him, like Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak and Rod Steiger. It was a very enjoyable experience. Half way through shooting I told Arnold I thought he should die in this movie. Of course Universal blanched at the idea, so I shot the ending both ways, and everybody agreed that the dying ending was the better one.  

Alternate ending was filmed in which Jericho resurrects after impaling himself on the sword of the statue and then leaves the church with Christine. Test audience preferred ending where Jericho dies. Even though "resurrection" ending was never released, it was used in novelization of the movie.  

==Reception==
The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an overall approval rating of 11%, based on 99 critics. On Metacritic, the film holds an average score of 33, based on 33 critics. It grossed $66,889,043 in the United States of America|U.S. and around $212,000,000 worldwide,  against a budget estimated to be between $80 million and $100 million. The film was profitable only because of its strong international numbers and DVD sales, but its final numbers were not what Universal Studios had hoped for.
Schwarzenegger received a salary of $25&nbsp;million for his lead role in the film.   

The film was nominated for three Razzie Awards including Worst Actor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Worst Supporting Actor (Gabriel Byrne) and Worst Director, and was a pre-nominee for Worst Picture, but was removed shortly before the actual awards ceremony.

The soundtrack to the film contained, for the most part, tracks by alternative metal and industrial rock bands. It also contains the first song to be released by the "new line-up" of Guns N Roses, the industrial rock track "Oh My God".  During the editing of the film, soundtrack selections were cut into the movie in a manner that none of the songs were left out, which meant overlaying songs in scenes that are typically silent in most thriller films. In several scenes we can hear a sample from the sounds library of Spectrasonics "Symphony Of Voices".
