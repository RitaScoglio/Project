 The Bad and the Beautiful", penned by David Raksin, has since become a jazz standard.

==Plot== Barry Sullivan) each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) in Paris. Movie producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) gathers them in his office and explains that Shields was calling them because he has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project.  Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem.  Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer.

As they await Shields call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields.  The backstory of their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire "Extra (acting)|extras" to attend his funeral.  Despite the industrys ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood by any means necessary. 
 poker game to film executive Pebbel, so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a $1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to be chosen as director.  The films success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel comes to work for him there.  Amiel, once independent of Shields, goes on to become an Academy Award for Best Director|Oscar-winning director in his own right.
 contract with his studio.  Rather than take her to court, Shields releases his rights to her, freeing her to go to another studio, which makes a fortune from her as she becomes a top Hollywood star.

Finally, Bartlow is a contented professor at a small college who has written a bestselling book, for which Shields has purchased the film adaptation rights. Shields wants Bartlow himself to write the films script. Bartlow is not interested, but his shallow Southern belle wife, Rosemary (Gloria Grahame) is, so he agrees to do it for her sake. They go to Hollywood, where Shields is annoyed to find that her constant distractions are keeping her husband from his work. He gets his suave actor friend Victor "Gaucho" Ribera (Gilbert Roland) to keep her occupied. Freed from interruption, Bartlow is able to make excellent progress on the script. Rosemary, however, runs off with Gaucho and they are killed in a plane crash. When the script is completed, Shields has the distraught Bartlow remain in Hollywood to help with the production as Shields takes over directing duties himself.  A first-time director, Shields botches the job, which leads to his bankruptcy.  Then Shields lets slip a casual remark that reveals his complicity in Rosemarys affair with Gaucho, so Bartlow walks out on him.  Now able to view his late wife more objectively, Bartlow goes on to write a novel based upon her (something Shields had previously encouraged him to do) and wins a Pulitzer Prize for it.

==Relation to real-life personalities== Cat People is clearly the inspiration behind an early Shields-Amiel film (Doom of the Cat Men).  The Georgia Lorrison character is the daughter of a "Great Profile" actor like John Barrymore (Diana Barrymores career was in fact launched the same year as her fathers death), but it can also be argued that Lorrison includes elements of Minnellis ex-wife Judy Garland.  Gilbert Rolands Gaucho may almost be seen as self-parody, as he had recently starred in a series of Cisco Kid pictures, though the characters name, Ribera, would seem to give a nod also to famed Hollywood seducer Porfirio Rubirosa. The director Henry Whitfield (Leo G. Carroll) is a "difficult" director modeled on Alfred Hitchcock, and his assistant Miss March (Kathleen Freeman) is modeled on Hitchcocks wife Alma Reville.  The James Lee Bartlow character may have been inspired by Paul Eliot Green,  the University of North Carolina academic-turned-screenwriter of The Cabin in the Cotton.
