== Plot ==
The film centers around the three children of Arthur (E. G. Marshall), a corporate attorney, and Eve (Geraldine Page), an interior decorator. Renata (Diane Keaton) is a poet whose husband Frederick, a struggling writer, feels eclipsed by her success. Flyn (Kristin Griffith) is a vain actress who is away most of the time filming; the low quality of her films is an object of ridicule behind her back. Joey (Mary Beth Hurt), who is in a relationship with Mike (Sam Waterston), cannot settle on a career, and resents her mother for favoring Renata, while Renata resents their fathers concern over Joeys lack of direction.

One morning, Arthur unexpectedly announces that he wants a separation from his wife and would like to live alone. Eve, who is clinically depressed and mentally unstable, attempts suicide. The shock of these two events causes a rift between the sisters. Arthur returns from a trip to Greece with Pearl (Maureen Stapleton), a high-spirited and more "normal" woman, whom he intends to marry. His daughters are disturbed that Arthur would disregard Eves suicide attempt and find another woman, whom Joey refers to as "vulgarian".

Arthur and Pearl marry at their summer home, with Renata, Joey and Flyn in attendance. Later in the evening, Joey lashes out at Pearl when she accidentally breaks one of Eves vases. In the middle of the night,  Frederick drunkenly attempts to rape Flyn. Meanwhile, Joey finds Eve in the house, and somberly explains how much she has given up for her mother, and how disdainfully she is treated. Eve walks out onto the beach and into the surf. Joey, Mike and Pearl attempt unsuccessfully to save her, but Joey almost drowns. In a twist of fate, Pearl saves her life.

===Critical response===
Interiors received a positive response from critics.  It currently has a 77% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 6.8/10. 

Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film "beautiful" and complimented Gordon Willis on his "use of cool colors that suggest civilizations precarious control of natural forces", but noted: 
:My problem with Interiors is that although I admire the performances and isolated moments, as well as the techniques and the sheer, headlong courage of this great, comic, film-making philosopher, I havent any real idea what the film is up to. Its almost as if Mr. Allen had set out to make someone elses movie, say a film in the manner of Mr. Bergman, without having any grasp of the material, or first-hand, gut feelings about the characters. They seem like other peoples characters, known only through other peoples art.

Richard Schickel of Time (magazine)|Time wrote that the films "desperate sobriety ... robs it of energy and passion"; Allens "style is Bergmanesque, but his material is Joseph Mankiewicz|Mankiewiczian, and the discontinuity is fatal. Doubtless this was a necessary movie for Allen, but it is both unnecessary and a minor embarrassment for his well-wishers." 
 Bergman and traditions and influences? Yes, and correctly. Allen, whose comedies have been among the cheerful tonics of recent years, is astonishingly assured in his first drama."   
 Easthampton White Waspiness obtaining to it all." 

===Woody Allens response===
Allens own fears about the films reception are recounted in a biography of Allen by Eric Lax, where he quotes Ralph Rosenblum, the films Film editing|editor:   
:He   managed to rescue Interiors, much to his credit. He was against the wall. I think he was afraid. He was testy, he was slightly short-tempered. He was fearful. He thought he had a real bomb. But he managed to pull it out with his own work. The day the reviews came out, he said to me, Well, we pulled this one out by the short hairs, didnt we?
 Edge of Night."

== In popular culture ==
Author, NPR commentator and political satirist Sarah Vowell mentions Interiors in her book Assassination Vacation during a comedic tangent about Maureen Stapleton playing Emma Goldman in the film Reds (film)|Reds: "And remember Stapleton in that Woody Allen movie, Interiors? Geraldine Page is all beige this and bland that so her husband divorces her and hooks up with noisy, klutzy Maureen Stapleton, who laughs too loud and smashes pottery and wears a blood-red dress to symbolize that she is Alive, capital A. Wait. I lost my train of thought. Where was I?"

The song "Death of an Interior Decorator", from the Death Cab for Cutie album Transatlanticism, is said to be about the film. It meantions the three children, the wedding and the breaking of the vase. 

Musician Blake Mills has named the film as one of his favorites.
