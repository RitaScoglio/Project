Harding is set on putting a club called "House of Thwax" run by Mistress Tanya Cheex out of business, and is sure that Peters secretly videotaped evidence of the clubs activities will do the trick.

==Reviews==
"Witty and kitsch". Among The Top 10 BDSM Movies. The Guardian, Anna Smith. 10th February 2015. 

"Turner makes Sharon Stone look like a mother superior, fiendish cameos from Tom Bell, Ricky Tomlinson etc. ... put on your mask and enjoy the party. This ballsy British independent deserves respect". Empire Magazine, Jake Hamilton

"A mesh of glamour and hilarity ... slick, with an excellent cast ... great dialogue". Dillie Tante The Independent on Sunday

*"The film boasts excellent costumes, good acting and is a great vision of what goes on in a good fetish club. Highly recommended!" Secret Magazine, February 2003

"Enjoyably offbeat" The Times April 27, 2004 (TV preview)

"a kind of high-tech, fast-paced, Moulin Rouge for the
fetish world...no wonder it was banned in Ireland" Curve Magazine

""Original setting ...sumptuous styling ... treat yourself and enjoy" i-D Magazine 1997
*"...the club scenes all look fabulous: intelligent use of colour and light." Erotic Review, December 2002

*"Those who actively participate in the S&M lifestyle may enjoy the lighthearted look at the underground fetish scene, but anyone looking for much more than an offbeat sex comedy is going to be woefully disappointed. Preaching to the Perverted lives up to its name by not being able to appeal to anyone but perverts." Qwipsters Movie Reviews, December 2003
