French Cancan is a 1954 French musical film written and directed by Jean Renoir and starring Jean Gabin and María Félix.  Le Carosse d’or had celebrated the 18th century Italian commedia dell’arte, this work is a homage to the Parisian Café chantant|café-concert of the 19th century with its popular singers and dancers. Visually, the film evokes the paintings of Degas and the Impressionism|Impressionists, including his own father Pierre-Auguste Renoir.  It also marked his return to France and to French cinema after an exile that began in 1940. 

==Plot==
Set in 1890s Paris, Henri Danglard is the owner of a cafe, which features his mistress, Lola, as a belly dancer. Losing money, Henri finds himself in Montmartre and finds that the old-fashioned can-can is still being performed there. Inspired, Henri comes up with a new business scheme that aims to revive the can-can, featuring a new dancer, Nini, a laundress he meets by chance.

==Critical reception== Degas sketch." Whilst Truffaut did not consider it as important a film as Rules of the Game or The Golden Coach, he nevertheless praised it as an example of Renoir "as vigorous and youthful as ever."  This affirmative response was not shared by Bernard Chardère however, writing in Positif (magazine)|Positif, who criticised the music, the sets, even the final cancan scene. "The phoniness of the rue Lepic, with its vegetable carts and piles of artificial stones is painful to look at. The actors act. The audience gets bored. The dance rehearsals are Degas all right, but the kind that appears on Post Office calendars."
