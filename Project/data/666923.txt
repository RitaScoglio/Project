 Jurassic Park, dinosaurs have secretly survived and been allowed to roam free on a deserted island off of Central Americas Pacific Coast. In the time between the two films, John Hammond loses control of his company, InGen, to his nephew, Peter Ludlow. Ludlow assembles a team to bring the animals back to the mainland to bring in revenue and restore the company. Hammond sees a chance to redeem himself for his past mistakes and sends an expedition led by Ian Malcolm (Jurassic Park character)|Dr. Ian Malcolm to reach the island before InGens team can get there. The two groups confront each other in the face of extreme danger and must team up for their own survival.

After the original books release and the first films success, Crichton was pressured by fans and Spielberg himself for a sequel novel. After the book was published in 1995, production began on a film sequel. The Lost World s plot and imagery is substantially darker than the previous film. Despite mixed reviews, it was a box office success, grossing $618 million worldwide.

==Plot== Jurassic Park, a wealthy family is on a boat cruise near Isla Sorna off of Central Americas Pacific coast. The daughter (Camilla Belle) wanders off and is attacked by a pack of Compsognathus. She is then saved by her family who have heard her screams. The incident allows Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), the unscrupulous nephew of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), to gain control of InGen. Hammond contacts Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), whose publication of the incident at Jurassic Park destroyed his academic reputation, to his home. He explains that Isla Sorna (also known as "Site B") is the island where the dinosaurs were engineered and nurtured before being moved to Isla Nublar, Jurassic Parks location. He also explains that after the park was shut down, a hurricane destroyed the containment facilities on Isla Sorna, and the dinosaurs have been living free in the wild ever since. Hammond requests Malcolm to join a team that will travel to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a way of rallying public support to prevent Ludlow from exploiting the site. Ian initially declines but, after learning that his girlfriend—paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore)—is part of the team and is already on the island, agrees to go.

Ian meets the other two members of the team: equipment specialist and engineer Eddie Carr ( . He decides to capture it by luring it to the cries of its injured offspring. That night, Ians team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to San Diego as the main attraction of a newly proposed theme park. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs, wreaking havoc upon the camp.

During the commotion, Nick frees the infant T. rex and takes it to the trailer so Sarah can mend its broken leg. Ian, Kelly, and Eddie secure themselves in a "high hide", a lift Eddie built to keep them safe above the trees. Fearing that the infants parents might be searching for it, Ian rushes to the trailer to warn them. As soon as he arrives, two adult T. rex emerge from the woods and threaten Ian, Sarah, and Nick. They decide to release the infant, but after a few minutes the adult T. rex return and attack the trailer, pushing it over the edge of a nearby cliff with Ian, Sarah and Nick trapped inside. Eddie tries to pull the trailer back over the edge with his SUV, but is devoured by the two T. rex, sending the trailer and Eddies SUV plummeting down the cliff. Ian, Sarah and Nick survive and are found by Kelly and the InGen team. With both groups communications equipment and vehicles destroyed in the attacks, they team up to reach the old InGen compounds radio station on foot. During the trip, Dieter Stark (Peter Stormare), Rolands second-in-command, is killed by a flock of Compsognathus after getting separated from the group during a rest.

The next night, the two T. rex come across the groups camp, having followed the scent of the infants blood on Sarahs jacket. One of the hunters notices them and screams, causing everyone to flee in panic. The female T. rex chases the group, while Roland stays behind and manages to tranquilize the male. The hunters disband into the thick trees and pass through a field of tall grass, where a troop of Velociraptors attack the hapless survivors. Ian, separated earlier from the group, reunites with Nick, Sarah and Kelly, and they continue on toward the compound. Nick finds the communications room and calls for rescue. After barely escaping a trio of Velociraptors, a helicopter finally arrives and whisks them off the island. From the air, they spot the unconscious male T. rex being prepared for transport.

A freighter carries the T. rex back to the mainland, but crashes into the dock at breakneck speed. Ludlow and several guards investigate and find that the crew has somehow been butchered. A guard opens the cargo hold, accidentally releasing the T. rex, which escapes into the city and goes on a rampage. Realizing the T. rex is likely searching for its infant, Ian and Sarah learn from Ludlow that the infant was captured and is in a secure InGen building. They rush to retrieve the infant and use it to lure the adult back to the ship. Ludlow tries to intervene but is trapped and cornered in the cargo hold by the adult T. rex and killed by the young T. rex. Before the adult can escape from the cargo hold, Sarah tranquilizes it while Ian closes the hold.

Ian, Sarah and Kelly watch on live television as the ship carrying the adult and infant T. rex is escorted back to Isla Sorna. John Hammond explains in an interview that the American and Costa Rican governments have agreed to declare the island a nature preserve. He ends the interview by saying "life will find a way", paraphrasing what Malcolm told him in the first film. The two adult T. rex and their baby are shown to have been returned safely.

==Production== Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park in 1993. Steven Spielberg held discussions with David Koepp and Crichton to discuss possible ideas for a sequel film, and requested Crichton to write a sequel novel.   Joe Johnston offered to direct the film, but the job ultimately went to Spielberg. 

  used in the film]]
A production team was assembled in spring 1995, as Crichton was finishing the novel while Spielberg and Koepp were developing ideas for the screenplay. Production designer Rick Carter traveled to the Caribbean, Central America and New Zealand to scout possible locations for filming, before settling on the redwood forests of Eureka, California.   

Filming began on September 5, 1996, at Fern Canyon, a part of Californias Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Filming continued for two weeks in other state parks and on private land in northern California. The films opening scenes were shot in Kauai, Hawaii. Throughout the fall of 1996, filming continued on stages at Universal Studios Hollywood.    The Site B workers village was constructed there and left intact after filming to become a part of the theme park tour.  Filming concluded ahead of schedule on December 11, 1996.  Filming at New Zealands Fiordland National Park was originally planned to take place over five days in December.   Plans to shoot there were scrapped for unknown reasons.

Although the ending takes place in San Diego, only one sequence is actually shot there, where the InGen helicopter flies over the wharf and banks towards the city. The other sequences were all shot in Burbank, California. 
 1925 film Sir Arthur The Lost World. 

Many elements from the original novel that were not ultimately used in the first film were instead used in The Lost World.  The opening sequence of a vacationing familys young daughter being attacked by a group of Compsognathus was very similar to the novels opening scene, and Dieter Starks death is also analogous to John Hammonds compy-related death in the novel. Also, Nick, Sarah, Kelly, and Burke being trapped behind a waterfall by one of the T. rexes was ultimately taken from the novel, where Tim and Lex are trapped behind a man-made waterfall with the T. rex attempting to eat them, and Roland Tembo shoots the T. rex with tranquilizer in the same way that Robert Muldoon did in the novel.
 Jack Horner, part of the waterfall scene was written in as a favor for him by Spielberg. Burke greatly resembles Horners rival Robert Bakker. In real life, Bakker argues for a predatory Tyrannosaurus while Horner views it as primarily a scavenger. So Spielberg wrote Burke into this part to have him killed by the T. rex as a favor for Horner. After the film came out, Bakker, who recognized himself in Burke and loved it, actually sent Horner a message saying "See, I told you T. rex was a hunter!".

===Critical response===

Another aggregator Metacritic gives the film a weighted average rating of 59/100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews." 

  saw improved character development over the original, saying, "It seemed such a mistake in Jurassic Park to sideline early on its most interesting character, the brilliant, free-thinking and outspoken theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) with a broken leg, but in its most inspired stroke, The Lost World brings back Malcolm and places him front and center," calling it "a pleasure to watch such wily pros as Goldblum and Attenborough spar with each other with wit and assurance."  The dinosaurs were even more developed as characters, with Stephen Holden of the New York Times saying, "The Lost World, unlike Jurassic Park, humanizes its monsters in a way that E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T. would understand."  Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B grade; he remarked, "Mr. T-Rex was cool in the first Spielberg flick, sure, but it wasnt until   San Diego that things got crazy-cool. Its the old tree falling in the woods conundrum: Unless your giant monster is causing massive property damage, can you really call it a giant monster?" 

Spielberg confessed that during production he became increasingly disenchanted with the film, admitting, "I beat myself up... growing more and more impatient with myself... It made me wistful about doing a talking picture, because sometimes I got the feeling I was just making this big silent-roar movie... I found myself saying, Is that all there is? Its not enough for me."
