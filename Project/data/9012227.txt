Mean Guns is a 1997 action film starring Ice-T, Christopher Lambert, Michael Halsey, Deborah Van Valkenburgh, and Hunter Doughty; directed by Albert Pyun.

==Plot summary==
Vincent Moon (Ice-T) represents a crime syndicate that just built a maximum security prison which is scheduled to open the next day. Rather than killing them individually, the crime syndicate brings together 100 people who have in some way wronged the syndicate, provides them with weapons, and gives them a choice: fight or die. The assassins are given six hours to eliminate the competition, and told that the last three will walk away with 10 million dollars. Various agreements and alliances are made as the killers battle for survival and the money.

== References to Other Media ==
Christopher Lambert plays a highly skilled killer attempting to eliminate all the others and make off with a prize, effectively the same high-concept as underlay his famous oft-reprised role as Connor MacLeod in the Highlander (franchise)|Highlander movies.

The soundtrack to the film is composed heavily of songs by Perez Prado, who is a favorite artist of Ice Ts character in the film.
 Stephen J. Friedman, who pioneered the production of independent films in Hollywood.
