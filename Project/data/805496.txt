}} Walt Disney Animated Classics, it is loosely based on the first two books in The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander, a series of five novels which in turn is based on Welsh mythology.

Set in the mythical land of Prydain during the dark ages, the film centers on the evil Horned King who hopes to secure an ancient magical cauldron and rule the world with its aid. He is opposed by a young pig keeper named Taran (character)|Taran, Princess Eilonwy, the bard Fflewddur Fflam, and a wild creature named Gurgi who seek to prevent him from ruling the world by destroying it.
 Richard Rich, Disney animated PG rating Dolby stereo Sleeping Beauty Buena Vista Distribution on July 24, 1985 to mixed critical reviews and was a box office bomb. Disney released the film for the first time on home video in 1998.

== Plot ==
 
 Taran is an "assistant pig-keeper" on the small farm of Caer Dallben, home of Dallben the Enchanter. Dallben learns that the Horned King is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which is capable of creating an invincible army of undead warriors, the “Cauldron Born”. Dallben fears the Horned King may try and steal his pig Hen Wen, which has oracular powers, and use her to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Tarans daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by the Horned Kings forces.
 catacombs beneath the castle, Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king, where he arms himself with the kings sword. It contains magic that allows him to effectively fight the Horned Kings minions and so to fulfill his dream of heroism. Along with a third captive, the comical, middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape the castle and are soon reunited with Gurgi.
 Doli is three witches—the grasping Orddu, who acts as leader; the greedy Orgoch; and the more benevolent Orwen, who falls in love with Fflewddur at first sight. Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Tarans sword, and he agrees, although he knows that to yield it will cost his chance for heroism. Before vanishing, the witches reveal that the cauldron remains indestructible, and that its power can be broken only by someone who climbs in under his own free will, which is likely to kill him. Taran feels foolish for aspiring to destroy the cauldron alone, but his companions show their belief in him. Suddenly, the glorious reverie is broken when the Horned Kings soldiers interrupt, having finally reached the marshes all by themselves. They seize the cauldron and everyone but Gurgi, and take their prisoners back to the castle. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world.

Gurgi manages to free the captives and Taran decides to cast himself into the cauldron, but Gurgi stops him and jumps into the cauldron himself. The undead army collapses. When the Horned King spots Taran at large, he infers the turn of events and throws the youth toward the cauldron; however, the cauldrons magic is out of control. It consumes the Horned King in a tunnel of fire and blood, as well as destroying the castle, using up all its powers forever. The three witches come to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. Taran has finally realized Gurgis true friendship, however, and he persuades them to revive the wild thing in exchange for the cauldron, giving up his magical sword permanently. Fflewddur challenges the reluctant witches to prove their powers by the revival, and they honor the request, restoring Gurgi to life. The four friends then journey back to Caer Dallben where Dallben and Doli watch them in a vision created by Hen Wen, and Dallben finally praises Taran for his heroism despite the fact that he prefers to be a Pig Boy.

For The Black Cauldron, a new way to transfer drawings to cels was invented, called the APT process. But as the APT-transferred line art would fade off of the cels over time, most or all of the film was done using the xerographic process which had been in place at Disney since the late 1950s.   

The Black Cauldron is notable for being Disneys first animated feature film to incorporate the use of computer generated imagery in its animation for bubbles, a boat, a floating orb of light, and the cauldron itself.  Although The Black Cauldron was released a year before The Great Mouse Detective, both movies were in production simultaneously for some time, and the computer graphics for the latter was done first. When producer Joe Hale heard about what was being done, the possibilities made him excited and he made the crew from The Great Mouse Detective project create some computer animation for his own movie. For others effects, animator Don Paul used live action footage of dry ice mists to create the steam and smoke coming out of the cauldron.

===Revision and editing===
Shortly before the films release to theaters, newly appointed Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered several scenes from The Black Cauldron be cut, due to both its length and the fear that the graphic nature of them would alienate children and family audiences.  Since animated films were typically edited in storyboard form using Leica reels (later known as Storyboard#Animatics|animatics: storyboards shot sequentially and set to temporary audio tracks), producer Joe Hale objected to Katzenbergs demands. Katzenberg responded by having the film brought into an edit bay and editing the film himself.   

Told what Katzenberg was doing by Hale, Disney CEO Michael Eisner called Katzenberg in the editing room and convinced him to stop. Though he did as Eisner insisted, Katzenberg demanded the film be revised, and delayed its scheduled Christmas 1984 release to July 1985 so that the film could be reworked. 
 Taran and Taran killing his foes with his sword while escaping The Horned Kings castle with Eilonwy by his side. Another scene cut featured a henchman of The Horned King being dissolved by the mist of the cauldron itself.

=== Composition ===
Unlike most other Disney animated films, the film contained no songs. At the time, Bernstein just came off the success of his Academy Award-nominated score for the 1983 film Trading Places as well as the score for the 1984 film Ghostbusters. Like in the latter of the two, The Black Cauldron saw the use of the ghostly ondes Martenot to build upon the dark mood of Prydain.   

=== Original release ===
Because of the films last minute revisions, much of Bernsteins score was cut and unused.  In its minority, the score was re-recorded for the album original release by Varèse Sarabande in 1985, with the composer conducting the Utah Symphony Orchestra. The album soon fell out of print and many of the films tracks did not resurface until a bootleg copy entitled "Taran" was supplied to soundtrack specialty outlets in 1986.

The summer theatrical release of The Black Cauldron partnered with the 30th anniversary of Disneyland which ran throughout 1985.

=== Box office performance ===
The Black Cauldron was finally released in North America on July 24, 1985.  The film was also screened at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. 
   While it both was the most expensive animated film ever made at the time and tied with Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra and Heavens Gate (film)|Heavens Gate as the most expensive film (unadjusted) made at the time, costing $44 million to produce,  the film was a box office bomb, grossing only $21.3 million domestically.  It was so poorly received that it was not distributed as a home video release for more than a decade after its theatrical run.  Adding insult to injury, the film was also beaten at the box office by The Care Bears Movie ($22.9 million domestically), which was released several months earlier by Disneys much-smaller rival animation studio Nelvana.    The film was however more successful outside North America notably in France where it had 3,074,481 admissions and was the fifth most attended film of the year. 
 Walt Disney Glendale in December 1984, and, following corporate restructuring, became a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Studios known as Walt Disney Feature Animation (later Walt Disney Animation Studios);  it returned to the Burbank studios in a new building in 1995.

=== Critical reception === Prydain book Time Out Walt Disney Studios, was dismayed by the product and the animators felt that it lacked "the humor, pathos, and the fantasy which had been so strong in Lloyd Alexanders work. The story had been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and it was heartbreaking to see such wonderful material wasted." 

Lloyd Alexander, the author of the books on which the film was based, had a more complex reaction to the film: 
  (1999) . Interview with Scholastic students. Scholastic Inc. Retrieved 2011-12-17. 
 First, I have to say, there is no resemblance between the movie and the book. Having said that, the movie in itself, purely as a movie, I found to be very enjoyable. I had fun watching it. What I would hope is that anyone who sees the movie would certainly enjoy it, but Id also hope that theyd actually read the book. The book is quite different. Its a very powerful, very moving story, and I think people would find a lot more depth in the book.

In 2008, Disney announced a Special Edition DVD release of the film to be released in 2009. However, its release date was pushed back to June 2010 before it was cancelled. Instead, the film was re-advertised as the 25th Anniversary DVD and released on September 14, 2010 in the US and UK. It contained a new 2.35:1 16:9 anamorphic widescreen transfer, one unfinished deleted scene called "The Fairfolk", and a new game called "The Witches Challenge" along with the features from the 2000 DVD release.

 wizard Dallben, visionary abilities. Fair Folk Magic Sword. witches of Morva who will trade it for the Sword. Unfortunately a dragon grasps the cauldron and Taran goes back to encounter the evil man himself. The game actually featured plot branches and multiple endings depending on many variables, such as whether Hen Wen the pig was saved, how the cauldron was destroyed, and what reward was chosen afterwards. This use of multiple endings predated the more famous use in Lucasfilms game Maniac Mansion by a year.

In order to make the game more accessible to children, Sierra used an innovative idea that would not reappear in the genre for the next 10 years: the   adventure games, such as the   or The Dig whose interfaces only consisted of "Look" and "Use". Being based on a Disney film, the graphics present some relative "flexibility", compared to the monolithic and straight sceneries of previous and later games.
