A Cinderella Story is a 2004 American teen  .

==Plot==
 
Ten-year-old Samantha "Sam" Montgomery (Hannah Robinson) lives in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, with her widowed father Hal (Whip Hubley), who runs a popular sports-themed diner. Hal soon marries a vain, self-absorbed woman named Fiona (Jennifer Coolidge). During the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Hal is killed when he runs to save Fiona. Supposedly he has left no will, so Fiona receives all of his belongings, including the house, the diner, and to her dismay, Sam.

Eight years later, Sam (Hilary Duff) is employed as a waitress at the diner to save money to attend Princeton University, but she is regularly tormented by Fiona and her dim-witted fraternal twin daughters, Brianna (Madeline Zima) and Gabriella (Andrea Avery). Fiona emotionally abuses Sam and uses unnecessary amounts of water during a drought. A running gag throughout the film demonstrates Sams stepsisters participating in synchronized swimming, for which they are found to have absolutely no talent. Sam struggles to cope socially at North Valley High School, where queen bee Shelby Cummings (Julie Gonzalo), also torments her and calls her "Diner Girl" along with other members of the popular clique.

Sam confides in her online pen pal "Nomad" about her dream to attend Princeton, a dream which he also shares. However, "Nomad"s true identity is Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray), the popular, yet unhappy, quarterback of the schools football team, and Shelbys boyfriend (although Austin broke up with her, she chooses to ignore it). "Nomad" proposes that they meet in person at the schools Halloween themed home coming dance. Initially reluctant, Sam is convinced by her best friend, Carter Ferrell (Dan Byrd), to go to the dance and meet her mysterious online friend. On the night of the dance, Fiona orders Sam to work the night shift at the diner, then leaves to drive Brianna and Gabriella to the dance. 

Carter, Rhonda (Regina King), Sams other best friend, and the rest of the diners staff convince her to disobey Fiona and go to the dance anyway. Carter and Rhonda take Sam to find a costume for the dance. Sam, wearing a mask and a beautiful white dress, meets "Nomad" at the dance, and is surprised and shocked to learn that he is Austin, who had become smitten with her upon her entrance. The two decide to leave the party to walk alone and get to know each other a little better. While sharing a romantic dance, Sam and Austin begin to fall in love. But just as Austin is about to unmask her, Sams cell phone alarm goes off, warning her to return to the diner before Fiona comes back at midnight. She leaves without revealing her identity to Austin, and drops her phone on her way out.

Austin picks up her phone and begins a desperate search to figure out who his "Cinderella" really is, but every girl at the dance claims to be the mysterious owner of the phone. Sam is reluctant to reveal her identity to Austin, feeling that he wont accept her due to her being an outsider. When Austin comes into the diner one day, Sam is forced to help him and, after a talk, she attempts to reveal her identity to him, but is cut off by Fiona. Sams stepsisters find out about Sam and Austins email relationship, and (after having failed to convince Austin that one of them is the owner of the phone) convince Shelby that Sam tried to steal Austin from her. During a pep rally, Sams identity is revealed to Austin. Hurt by Sams secrecy, Austin does nothing as she is humiliated in front of the school, and Sam believes he betrayed her.

Like Austin, Sam had been accepted to Princeton, only to be duped by Fiona into believing she was rejected. Sam then decides to give up her dreams and resigns herself to working at the diner, but Rhonda gives Sam a pep talk. When her stepsisters come in, they slam the door, causing a guitar to fall off the wall, taking the wallpaper down with it. Sam then sees her fathers words, "Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game," and regains her confidence (in real life this quote came from Babe Ruth). She stands up to Fiona, quits her job at the diner, and moves out to live with Rhonda. Rhonda and the entire diners staff quit along with Sam, having only put up with Fionas abuse all those years after Hal died for Sams sake. The customers, who watched the whole scene, leave the diner as well.

Before a school football game, Sam confronts Austin about his cowardice and lies. Before the final play of the game, he sees Sam making her way out of the stands, and finally stands up to his father, saying he wants to attend Princeton rather than simply play football all his life. He hands his helmet to his teammate, Ryan Henson (J.D. Pardo), then chases after Sam and apologizes. She accepts his apology and they share their first kiss as rain falls over the drought-plagued valley. Soon after, Sam finds Hals will hidden in her childhood fairytale book, stating that all of his belongings belong to her. Sam sells her step-familys fancy cars so that she can pay for college, and Fiona, who signed the will as a witness but claims she never saw that will, is arrested after being chased through the front yard of what is now Sams house by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).

Fiona, Brianna and Gabriella are made to work off the money they stole from Sam at the diner, which is restored to its former glory by its new owners, Sam and Rhonda. Sam finds that she was in fact accepted by Princeton; the acceptance letter was found in the garbage by her stepsisters. Also, Austins father comes to accept his sons desire to attend Princeton. Things even work out in the end for Carter as he makes a commercial for acne medication. After being dumped by Austin, Shelby then makes a play for Carter, only to be spurned in favor of the schools DJ, Astrid (Aimee-Lynn Chadwick). The film ends with Sam and Austin, now officially a couple, driving off to Princeton together.
