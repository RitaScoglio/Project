Zachariah (1971 in film|1971) is a film starring John Rubinstein as Zachariah and Don Johnson as his best friend Matthew.

==Production==
The film is loosely based on Hermann Hesses novel Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha,  surrealistically adapted as a musical Western by Joe Massot and the members of the Firesign Theatre comedy troupe. The band Country Joe and the Fish perform as an inept gang of robbers (more adept as musicians) called "the Crackers," who are always "looking for people who like to draw." In the same vein, Zachariah boasts: "I can think, I can wait, and Im fast on the draw." This is a parody of Siddharthas famous line: "I can think, I can wait, I can fast."

Underneath the gunplay, the jokes, and the music, an important message is delivered: a life of pacifism, quiet contemplation, male bonding and vegetarianism is preferable to a life of violence.

This film is defined as being part of the Acid Western genre.  More precisely, in its own publicity releases, it was called, "The first electric western."  This was, in no small part, because this film featured several appearances and music supplied by successful rock bands from the era, including the James Gang and Country Joe and the Fish. Fiddler Doug Kershaw has a musical cameo that advances the plot of the film. The movie also features former John Coltrane sideman Elvin Jones as a gunslinging drummer named "Job Cain."

Cream (band)|Creams drummer Ginger Baker and The Band were originally scheduled to be major players in the film.  

Don Johnson later said "I was sort of the Govinda character". 
The Minneapolis group White Lightnin (an off-shoot of the band The Litter) performs their rock and roll version of the William Tell Overture on the soundtrack.  The New York Rock and Roll Ensemble perform Grave Digger on the soundtrack. The soundtrack features songs by the James Gang, Joe Walsh, and Country Joe and the Fish.  "Laguna Salada" and "Country Fever", performed in the film by the James Gang, later reappeared as bonus tracks on the 2000 re-release of The James Gang Greatest Hits.     The soundtrack for Zachariah has also recently become available.

Film composers Michael Kamen and Mark Snow can be seen half naked singing in a band while film composer/actor John Rubinsteins character makes love to Patricia Quinn (the American actress, who co-starred in Alices Restaurant (film)|Alices Restaurant) in bed.

The film and its soundtrack received a positive review in the pages of Circus, a rock music magazine.  The soundtrack album was released as a vinyl LP by Probe Records|Probe, a subsidiary label owned by ABC Records|ABC.

==Reception==
The film recorded a loss of $1,435,000.
