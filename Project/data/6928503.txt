 Stephen Curry, Nathan Phillips. Victoria with the invention of the ever great "Take away".

==Plot==
Tony Stilano and Trev Spackneys both own, live over and work in adjoining take-away fish and chip shops in Melbourne. Although they have fallen into a habitual rivalry based on a cause long forgotten, the pair unite when the multinational fast-food outlet "Burgies" unveils a new store directly opposite the twin fish and chips shops.

Stilano (portrayed by Vince Colosimo) is an uptight store runner, demanding everything be in order including his drinks- the coldest must always be at the front. Spackneys (played by Stephen Curry), however is the opposite. His chips are made of dirty potatoes and he couldnt care less about health or safety precautions.
Both owners are aided by their two romantically linked apprentices. Sonja Stilano (Tonys cousin, played by Rose Byrne) and Dave (played by Nathan Phillips).

==Filming locations== Alphington railway station in Alphington, Victoria.  Other parts of the movie was also filmed in the upcoming suburb of Northcote, Melbourne, including the old AMF Bowling, and the Northcote YMCA. The set was demolished after filming was complete. The land was since subdivided and new houses built on it.
