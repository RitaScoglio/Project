Rack, Shack and Benny is the fourth episode of the VeggieTales animated series and the first to present one story instead of two shorter segments. The show was first released in late 1995 on VHS and was reissued in 1997 and was even distributed by Word Entertainment. In 1998, Lyrick Studios released the VHS with special quality. Subtitled "A Lesson in Handling Peer Pressure," it teaches viewers about avoiding unhealthy peer pressure and standing up for their beliefs.

The video is a retelling of the biblical story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, from the Book of Daniel. In the story, King Nebuchadnezzar II requires that all his subjects bow down before a false idol. But three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refuse and are thrown into a furnace. They remain unharmed, and Nebuchadnezzar recognizes the power of their God.

Rack, Shack and Benny adheres to the original story, but places it in a chocolate factory at which all employees are required to bow down before a giant chocolate bunny and sing "The Bunny Song."

==Plot==

The episode starts with Bob the Tomato all by himself. Larry the Cucumber comes into the scene wearing an oven mitten on his head. When asked why, Larry says that it is because he saw it on the cover of "Veggie Beat" magazine and that all the cool people are wearing them. This reminds Bob of a letter from Dexter Wilmington of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. It is about when Dexter is at his friend Billys house Billy wants to watch a TV show Dexter cant watch and wonders what Dexter should do. Larry then decides he needs Qwerty. Unable to see, however, he almost falls into a toaster and he ultimately crashes into the sink. Bob then introduces the story about three people who had a similar experience.
 Grandpa George Laura Carrot, works as the factorys delivery girl.
 Sedgewick Lunt comes out to soak up the appreciation of his employees, he finds them all lying ill, except for Rack, Shack, and Benny. Impressed by their ability to stand up for themselves, Mr. Nezzer promotes them to Junior Executives (which means they get to wear a tie).

The following day, Mr. Nezzer calls the trio into his office and gives them a sneak peek at his secret project. Wanting to show everybody at Nezzer Chocolate about how important "the bunny" is, Mr. Nezzer believes that if it were a big bunny, all of his employees would love it as much as he. Mr. Nezzer then shows them a model despicting a ninety-foot bunny statue for his employees to worship. He also demonstrates a song of worship called "The Bunny Song" with lyrics stating that nothing in the world, be it God, parents, healthy food, Church, or School, is more important than "the bunny". When asked by Rack as to what would happen if someone refuses to sing and worship, Mr. Nezzer draws their attention to the furnace (where the "bad bunnies" are disposed of) and warns that "in my mind, if you dont bow down and sing the song, youre a bad bunny!" 

The completed bunny statue is unveiled later in the day at a ceremony, and Mr. Nezzer orders all his employees to bow down and sing. However, Mr. Lunt notices that Rack, Shack, and Benny are not bowing, and Mr. Nezzer confronts them. Shack (later joined by Rack and Benny) tries to sing his naptime song. Mr. Nezzer is briefly touched (saying that the song "Juniors Lullaby" was wonderful), but it does not change his mind and so Rack, Shack and Benny are sent to the furnace. Laura then wonders what she should do to help them.
 his parents (all dressed as Disney tourists) arrive for a photo opportunity. The song then continues and Larry again taunts Bob until the tomato finally loses his temper and chases Larry offstage.

The main story then resumes as Mr. Nezzer sings about everything he did for the boys and how they disobey him in return. The conveyor belt carries them down to the furnace but he gives Rack, Shack and Benny one more chance to sing the song. But still the trio refuse, explaining that they were taught to stand up for their beliefs. Mr. Nezzer understands their reasoning but condemns them as bad bunnies.  Then he sends them down a chute into the furnace. However, they are rescued at the last second by Laura Carrot in her delivery truck. She (pursued by two carrot guards,) attempts to escape the factory, but Rack, Shack, and Benny are captured and the three boys eventually fall into the furnace. As Mr. Nezzer gloats, the lights suddenly go out and a strange sound hums through the factory. As this happens, Mr. Lunt looks inside the furnace and notices that theres a fourth person in the furnace whos "real shiny" and that nobody is burning up. When Rack, Shack, and Benny emerge from the furnace unscathed, Mr. Nezzer realizes that their faith in God is what saved them despite the peer pressure he inflicted on them. The three boys forgive Mr. Nezzer for his mistakes and lead him and the factory into a song appropriately titled "Stand Up!"

Back on the countertop, Larry is still stuck in the sink. He recognizes now that peer pressure is not good, and that common sense, ones own beliefs, and what one was taught by ones parents are more valuable than fleeting fads. Lamenting his wasted life, Bob offers to help Larry up, but during the rescue is stranded in Larrys place. Larry wraps up the show with List of VeggieTales characters#Qwerty|Qwertys verse which reads "Stand firm and hold to the teaching we passed onto you". Larry leaves the scene, ignoring the fact that Bob is still stuck in the sink, and the episode ends.

==Changes to The Bunny Song== Big Idea, complaining that their kids were singing in public about not loving their mom or their dad or not going to church or school. Vischer said that the lesson that he learned was to never mix negative lyrics with a catchy tune, since kids will sing the song irrespective of the content.
 the first VeggieTales sing-along video, a "New and Improved Bunny Song" was written, which had a repentant Mr. Nezzer singing that eating too much candy is wrong and that Church and School are important. The original offending lines were dubbed to, "I didnt eat my soup or my bread, just the bunny," and "Yeah, Ill go to church and Ill go to school," respectively. The backup singing from the original remains unaltered, though Mr. Nezzer is now trying to get the girls to stop singing with no success. 

Following the 1998 re-print of Rack, Shack & Benny, the song has been changed again such that "I dont love my mom or my dad" was changed to "I dont love my soup or my bread," and the line "I wont go to church and I wont go to school" was changed to "I wont eat no beans and I wont eat tofu" respectively.
