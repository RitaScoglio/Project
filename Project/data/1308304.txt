Sidekicks is a 1992 action film starring Jonathan Brandis and Chuck Norris.

==Plot==
The main protagonist is Barry Gabrewski, an asthmatic boy who lives with his widowed father, Jerry Gabrewski (Beau Bridges), in Houston, Texas. A loner, Barry has vivid daydreams about being Chuck Norris sidekick, battling against Norriss movie enemies â€” who are often personified by Barrys everyday bullies such as Randy Cellini (John Buchanan). Noreen Chan (Julia Nickson-Soul), his favorite teacher, often plays the damsel in distress in his dreams.

Barry wants to be taught martial arts, but is turned down by the arrogant dojo owner Kelly Stone (Joe Piscopo|Piscopo) for being too weak. Instead, he is taken on as a student by an old Chinese man called Mr. Lee (Makoto Iwamatsu|Mako), the sly uncle of his teacher. Mr. Lee teaches Barry to defend himself from the bullies and treats his asthma, increasing Barrys endurance. Barry later enters a tournament with Mr. Lee and Ms. Chan and finally sees his dreams fulfilled, after being told a team must have three members, when Chuck Norris, originally only a guest at the tournament but persuaded by Lee to aid one of his most ardent fans, joins them as a team member.
