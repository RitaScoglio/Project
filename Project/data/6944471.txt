==Plot==
Moscow based newspaper reporter Philip Sutherland is in love with Marya, a ballerina. He and radio broadcaster Steve Quillan go to see her perform "Swan Lake" with the Bolshoi Ballet, and a pleased Philip learns that Marya wishes to marry him and accompany him home to San Francisco.

They are married in the U.S. embassy, where they are warned that obtaining an exit visa is often quite difficult. On their honeymoon, they meet Christopher Denny, an Englishman married to  Maryas good friend Svetlana, who is pregnant. But when he is seen taking innocent photographs, Denny is taken into custody and banished from Russia.

Svetlana gives birth to a son in Philips and Maryas apartment. Cold War tensions are heightened and when the Sutherlands attempt to leave, Marya is detained. Philip flies home alone and is unable to get permission to return.

He travels to London, where he and Denny hatch a scheme to sail to a Baltic coast town Tallinn where the Bolshoi is scheduled to perform. Quillan offers to help by giving coded instructions to Marya and Svetlana on his radio broadcasts. At their rendezvous point, Svetlana swims out safely to the boat, but says an added ballet performance has forced Marya to stay behind.

Philip swims ashore. Stealing a medical officers clothes, he attends the ballet. Marya pretends to faint and Philip spirits her away, but another dancer recognizes him and informs the authorities. The pursued car of the Sutherlands goes off a pier. But first they leap to safety, and swim together to the boat.
