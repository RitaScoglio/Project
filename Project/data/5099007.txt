 American sports/fantasy Lorimar and distributed by United Artists. The rights to the film are currently owned by Warner Bros. through its 1989 acquisition of Lorimar.  
 Civic Arena as well as suburban Moon Township, Pennsylvania.

The movie has attracted a cult following, most notably for its disco-inspired setting and soundtrack, as well as the appearances of many NBA stars (including lead actor Julius Erving) and early roles for Debbie Allen, Stockard Channing and Harry Shearer.  The film also has a cameo by long time Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri as himself, hosting the fictional team at a rally and shaking hands with Erving.

==Plot==
 Pittsburgh Pythons, whose continuous losing streak and lack of talent has made them the laughing stock of Pittsburgh. Several players ask to be transferred to other teams, partly due to the bad publicity and the presence of the difficult but highly paid star player, Moses Guthrie (Julius Erving).

Believing that the team needs a miracle, ballboy/waterboy Tyrone Millman ( , the star sign of Moses Guthrie.  The team is reborn as the "Pittsburgh Pisces".

Although Moses and Tyrones sister (Margaret Avery) think that Tyrones idea is absurd, they ultimately embrace the concept.  The plan succeeds wildly due to the new teams eccentric skills, teamwork, and Monas astrological readings, culminating in a championship opportunity.

==Production notes==
Singer/actress Cher was originally cast as Mona Mondieu, but she backed out at the last minute.
Singer/actress Dee Dee Bridgewater who played Brandy, previously won a Tony Award for her role as Glinda in The Wiz on Broadway also under the direction of Gilbert Moses. The two later married.
==Novelization==
 
A novelization was released in 1979, written by Richard Woodley, based upon an early draft of the screenplay by Jaison Starkes and Edmond Stevens. As a consequence the novel differed in several respects from the finished film. In the film, the Pisces were seen winning every game, but the novel mentions the team losing two games. Another scene involved a group of people in wheelchairs causing havoc at one game; that scene was shown during the films preview trailer but was later scrapped.

==DVD releases==
In 2010 Warner Bros. Home Video made the film available on DVD and digital download as part of its Warner Archive Collection.
