 racist Xenophobia|xenophobe), and postmen (his favorite targets).

The camera crew becomes more and more involved in the murders, first as accomplices but eventually taking an active part in them. When Ben invades a home and kills an entire family, they help him hold down a young boy and smother him. They meet a competing camera crew and take turns shooting the three men. During filming, two of Bens crew are killed; their deaths are later called "occupational hazards" by a crew member.

When Ben takes a couple hostage in their own home, he holds the man at gunpoint while he and the crew gang-rape the woman. The following morning, the camera dispassionately records the aftermath: the woman has been butchered with a knife, her entrails spilling out, and the man has been shot to death. Bens violence becomes more and more random until he kills an acquaintance in front of his girlfriend and friends during a birthday dinner. Spattered with blood, they act as though nothing horrible has happened, continuing to offer Ben presents. The film crew disposes of the body for Ben.

After a victim flees before he can be killed, Ben is arrested, but he escapes. At this point someone starts taking revenge on him and his family. Ben discovers that his parents have been killed, along with his girlfriend: a flautist, she has been murdered in a particularly humiliating manner, with her flute inserted into her anus. This prompts Ben to decide that he must leave. He meets the camera crew to say farewell, but in the middle of reciting a poem he is abruptly shot dead by an off-camera gunman. The camera crew is then picked off one by one. After the camera falls, it keeps running, and the film ends with the death of the fleeing sound recordist.

==Production==
 
The film is shot in   by the Motion Picture Association of America for "strong graphic violence". 

 
Although it is never shown or suggested in the film itself that Benoit kills a baby, the original poster features an image of a babys pacifier with spattering blood coming from an unseen target at the end of Benoits gun. For foreign release posters (not including the Region 4/Australian release), the babys pacifier was changed to a set of dentures. 

==Reception==

Film critic Rob Gonsalves called the film  "  original, a stark and (sorry) biting work far more complex, both stylistically and thematically, than first meets the eye."   The film was screened at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival where it won the SACD award for Best Feature and the Special Award of the Youth for directors Rémy Belvaux, André Bonzel and Benoît Poelvoorde.  The films controversial content and extreme violence was off-putting to some viewers, and resulted in the film being banned in Sweden.
