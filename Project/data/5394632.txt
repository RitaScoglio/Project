 Narain and Telugu as Raju Bhai and in Kannada as Kichha Huchha. Bhavana (actress)|Bhavanas performance as Charu received critical acclaim and earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil. 

==Plot==

Thiru (Narain) works as a henchman with Annachi (Dandapandi). Annachi adores him and sees in him his own bravery and extraordinary fighting abilities.

One day, Thiru stumbles upon Charu (Bhavana), a local NGO, who fights injustice. A quarrel ensues between them.  They soon realize that it was a meeting of heart and soon start to admire each other. Charu works towards transforming Thiru from an emotionless henchman to a lovable, kind-hearted guy. As a result, he and some of his gang members abandon their incorrigible life of gun culture and take up sales at the roadside hoping to lead a socially respectable life.

Charu sees a changed personality in Thiru and decides to marry him, with the consent of her father. But her hopes shatters after seeing Thiru clumped away in a police van from a brothel. She gives up her plans to become Thirus life partner. Notwithstanding the failure, Charus father commits suicide. Charu blames Thiru for ruining her life and for her fathers death. Thiru goes back to Annachi. Charu decided to wed her own relative. Meanwhile, Annachis son falls in love with Charu and wants to marry her.  Annachi deputes Thiru to bring Charu.

Thiru devices his own plans in an attempt to thwart Annachis nefarious plans and save Charu. How Thiru saves Charu from Annachi and ultimately re-unite with her forms the remaining part of the story.

==Inspiration==
Mysskin expressed in a book release function that he himself got to realize that this movie is an accidental inspiration of Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) while the shooting was progressing. He questioned the critics why they failed to criticize about this accidental inspiration whereas they criticized Nandalala, his other movie to be a copy of Kikujiro. He expressed this irrelevant to the book release function. However, he is a very good director.

==Release==
The film was released by Dreambride Productions on 10 February 2006 and initially failed to attract audience due to a low-profile release, lacking publicity,  becoming removed from almost all theatres within two weeks after its release.  Aascar Ravichandran who watched the film at a theatre in Chennai, clinched a deal with the producing studio and purchased the film outright for   1.75 crores. He began promoting the heavily, particularly on the basis of the song "Vazha Meenukkum" from the films soundtrack, spending   1 crores on publicity and marketing, and re-released it with his large network another two weeks later, helping the film to get wide publicity. The film eventually went on to collect   8 crores and became declared a financial success.
