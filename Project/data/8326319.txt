==Plot== depressed psychic mummified corpses possessed the mutating them into hideous monsters.

==Production==
Shooting took place in Statesville, North Carolina, in 1989.  In December 1989, a botched special effect caused a fire. 

==Reception== cult classic.   In a negative review, Lawrence Cohn of Variety (magazine)|Variety stated that, instead of being funny, the film "comes off as merely silly".   Adam Tyner of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and said that the film wastes too much time on setup rather than the campy monsters that have brought it a cult following.   Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called it an "energetic but directionless fiend-fest".  Dendle praised the acting and serious nature of the first hour but said later scenes cause the tone to "just get silly".
