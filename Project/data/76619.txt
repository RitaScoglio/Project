 short in Der Fliegende Holländer, and Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser. It borrows heavily from the second opera in the "Ring Cycle" Die Walküre, woven around the standard Bugs-Elmer conflict.

Originally released to theaters by Warner Bros. on July 6, 1957, Whats Opera, Doc? features the speaking and singing voices of Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan as Bugs and Elmer, respectively. The short is also sometimes informally referred to as Kill the Wabbit after the line sung by Fudd to the tune of Wagners "Ride of the Valkyries", the opening passage from Act Three of Die Walküre (which is also the leitmotif of the Valkyries).

==Plot== The Flying Dutchman, which causes lightning to strike the tree next to Bugs. At that, Bugs flees, Elmer realizes "That was the wabbit!", and the chase begins.

Suddenly, Elmer is stopped in his tracks at the sight of the beautiful  , director Jones notes that the production team "gave the horse the operatic curves we couldnt give Bugs"). "Siegfried" and "Brünnhilde" exchange endearments, set to the "Pilgrims Chorus" theme from Tannhäuser as orchestrated in the operas overture.

Eventually, the ensuing storm tears apart the mountains where Bugs has fled. Elmer triumphantly rushes to see his victory, but upon seeing the bunnys seemingly lifeless body, which is strangely intact, Elmer immediately regrets his wrath and tearfully carries the bunny off, presumably to Valhalla in keeping with the Wagnerian theme, per Act III of The Valkyries (although the music again comes from the overture to Tannhäuser). Bugs suddenly raises his head to face the audience and remarks, "Well, what did you expect in an opera? A happy ending?", ironically undoing the intended sad conclusion. The Merrie Melodies end title card then appears with all the words already there.

This cartoon marks one of only three times that Bugs Bunny is defeated by Fudd. The other two are Rabbit Rampage and Hare Brush. This is also the only one of the three where Fudd shows regret for defeating Bugs.

==Wagners music== Brooklynese accent), The Flying Dutchman. Specific excerpts include:

* The overture from The Flying Dutchman — opening storm scene
* Siegfrieds horn call from Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried — "O mighty warrior of great fighting stock"

* The overture from Rienzi— as Elmer is chasing Bugs.
* The Bacchanal from Tannhäuser — ballet scene between Elmer and Bugs

==Awards==
The cartoon is widely regarded as Chuck Jones’ masterpiece, and many film critics, animation fans and filmmakers consider it to be the greatest of all the cartoons Warner Bros. released. It has topped many Top Ten lists of the greatest animated cartoons of all time. It was rated by a panel of over 1000 animators in   as the #1 greatest cartoon of all time. 

In 1992 it became the first cartoon short to be deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Duck Amuck and One Froggy Evening were later inducted into the registry, making Chuck Jones the only animator with three shorts thus recognized.   

==A magnum opus==
Whats Opera, Doc? required about six times as much work and expense as any of the other six-minute cartoons his production unit was turning out at the time. Jones has admitted as much, having described a surreptitious re-allocation of production time to complete the short.  During the six minutes of Whats Opera, Doc?, Jones lampoons:

* The Walt Disney Company|Disneys Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia,
* The contemporary style of ballet,
* Wagners perceived ponderous operatic style, and even
* The by-then clichéd Bugs-and-Elmer formula.
