 Republic movie Treasury Agents investigating a Cold War counterfeiting operation believed to be connected to a circus.

==Plot==
 Treasury Agents Acrobat Bert King agrees to help his old friend Art (they were both paratroopers in the war) in searching for the counterfeiters; his acrobatic partner "June Edwards" assists him actively.  From the start of their involvement, they find themselves repeatedly threatened by two thugs, "Daley" and "Travis".  Early evidence leads Bert and June to a cave which leads to an isolated beach, and contains gear belonging to the gang.  They are unaware, however, that in a minisub off this beachs shoreline hides Zorn, the counterfeiter who is printing the phoney bills.  Ultimately, however, the evidence points to an unknown, higher authority directing the operations of these men, and apparently indeed someone connected with the circus.  Among the most suspicious-acting of the circus staff are Burton the clown, and any of three "rubes", at least one of whom seems to be lurking by when something threatens the life of Bert or June.

King of the Carnival was budgeted at $172,995 although the final negative cost was $177,050 (a $4,055, or 2.3%, overspend).  It was the cheapest Republic serial of 1955. 

It was filmed between 8 March and 25 March 1955 under the working title King of the Circus.  At seventeen days this is the joint-shortest, with Zombies of the Stratosphere, filming period of all Republic serials.   The serials production number was 1800. 

Republic liked calling their heroes "King" in order to use the title "King of..." The studio had found success with this naming scheme following the adaptation of Zane Greys King of the Royal Mounted. {{cite book
