==Plot== Lewis McKenzie) is a 15-year-old misfit living in Manchester, where nothing seems to go his way. Jimmy is constantly threatened by the school bully, "Gorgeous" Gordon (Bobby Power); he is also not sure what to make of Johnny (Ben Miller), a lost-in-the-ozone biker who is dating Donna (Gina McKee), Jimmys mum; and he has a crush on one of his classmates, Sara (Samia Smith), who seems to like him, but his powers of speech invariably fail him when he tries to talk to her. Like most Natives of Manchester|Mancunians, Jimmy loves football. He is a fervent supporter of Manchester City and attends home games with Donnas ex-boyfriend, Harry (Ray Winstone). Jimmy also loves to play football, but while Eric (Robert Carlyle), the coach of his schools team, thinks he has potential, "Gorgeous" is already a skilled player, and when Gordons father informs the school he will make a large and much-needed donation if their team makes it to the Manchester Schools Cup final, it looks like Jimmy will be on the bench for a while. But when an old woman gives Jimmy a pair of boots that once belonged to one of Citys greatest players, his skills on the field begin to change.
