 Indian Hockey Federation in April 2008 emphasised the films influence. After a new hockey council was formed, former hockey player, Aslam Sher Khan, stated in an interview, "We have to make a Team India as you have seen in bollywood blockbuster Chak De! India. There are players from several parts of the country. We have to unite them to make a powerful force." 

==Metaphorical Background of Chak De ==
How this expression  Chak De  has been literally used to describe the metaphorical characteristics needs be described. Let us review the evolution as under:
{{quote box|width=48em|align=left|quote= On a metaphorical note Thareja explores "The term ‘Chak De’ (meaning: ‘pick up’) has emerged stronger, graduating from a mere bi-syllable word in Punjabi language to an expression of hope;   through the broadbasing of a title of Hindi Bollywood film. This dialect is now well dispersed globally encompassing a schema of mentoring, motivation, and of overcoming misdemeanours. Infact, ‘Chak De’ remained as much normal through the ages as a special one it has become post the melodrama.  Chak De! India" primarily acts as a refreshing reminder to the success in a  Hockey game-play, as also a future folklore of inciting a nationalistic spirit. The movie: ‘Chak De’ (which displays a format or template of inducting ‘motivation for winning’ a series of games) proffers among the actors (who play as members of Indian Hockey team), a paradigm of real team spirit as per the original designs to the evolution of his sport Hockey". }}

The screenplay drew from interviews with current members of the womens field hockey team as well as the coaches. Sahni noted that, "the story of Chak De was deeply inspired by the real life story of ex Chief National Coach Maharaj Krishan Kaushik and his Indian Womens hockey teams real feat of winning the Commonwealth and many other championships." {{cite web

While not initially enthusiastic about being involved in the film, Negi changed his mind after reading the screenplay.

The media often compared the character of Kabir Khan to Negi (who faced accusations of throwing the match against Pakistan during the 1982 Asian Games). {{cite web

===Casting and filming===
Salman Khan was initially signed to do the lead role, but later withdrew due to creative difference with the director  The role was confirmed for ShahRukh, who had initially refused it when it was offered to him by producer Aditya Chopra due to a conflicting schedule at the time when he was working on Karan Johars Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. However, because of the long process taken for pre-production works, he was able to take up the part.    In an interview with Rediff, Khan stated that he also accepted the role of Kabir Khan because he liked "the thought of a film whose plot is about women   I think young women should be encouraged in every field of life. Its difficult being a woman and thats why I try do such films every year."  In addition, he was a hockey player during his college days and aspired to be a professional hockey player before he suffered a back injury.  Khan noted that while this background helped him during the filming, he also felt that the experience of playing again after a long time was "very difficult and different". Khan tore a hamstring three days before the filming was over.  

Khans role is described as offbeat because it departed from his usual onscreen romantic image and didnt include any lip syncing songs and no female lead.    The casting of the actresses to portray the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as "very, very difficult" and "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A training camp was set up for four months, and the girls had to learn the rules of the game, take acting lessons and go through a strict diet. Moreover, precautions were taken to make sure of the safety of the actors.  He noted: "Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. You have to know how to hold the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesnt look fake on screen (...) For those who were originally players, we had to make sure they were able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isnt frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner." The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast went through a lot of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began. 

Kaushik and his team taught the crew "all   knew about hockey." In an interview, Kaushik stated, "I taught him (Sahni) everything about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams."  ]  After Negis name was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the girls in the film. 

Negi coached the cast stating, "I trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But we were on a mission   They couldnt run; couldnt hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them   cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). The girls have worked very hard. I salute them."  Some of the actors such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia were cast because they were actual hockey players. {{cite web

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Chak De! India was critically acclaimed in India and abroad.

====India====
Subhash K. Jha gave the film a rave review stating, "First things first! "Chak De India" is an outright winner. A triumph of the spirit, and of craftsmanship! While director Shimit Amin of "Ab Tak Chhappan" fame has crafted a film with immense staying power and exceptional integrity and gusto, the thought-process behind the endearing endeavour harks back to a series of well-crafted Hollywood films about team spirit, the low-spirited team and the burnt-out disgraced and exiled coach who motivates the team and galvanises his own dormant spirit into a wide-alert status."  Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and argues that it has "great performances by a bunch of unknowns, a gritty pace and a marvellous restraint make Chakde India an unbridled ode to patriotism without any hysterical chest-beating. And yes, for all you SRK fans and bashers, this time the verdict gotta be unanimous: Chakde Shah Rukh! Can you better this?" {{cite web

The girls, from the truculent Haryanvi Komal to the angry Bindiya, from the Punjabi Balbir to the very proper Punjabi, Chandigarh ki kudi Preeti, may be drawn from stereotypes but they shatter them with aggressive performances, staring Khan in the eye, almost defeating the Indian mens hockey team, assaulting a gang of boys and showing the six-time Australian team a thing or two about how to win." {{cite web

}}  Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu asks "when did we last make a solid ensemble film about sports – one thats not about a few players saving the day but about the triumph of teamwork? Chak De is that rare film where the hero watches from the stands and lets a bunch of whats-her-name-again girls do all the winning   At another level, Chak De is about womens liberation. It is one of the best feminist films of our times. Next, the girls themselves are the closest weve seen to a representation of India in any sports movie weve seen. They are not 16 pretty young things. The casting is first-rate. The rawness in the performances actually makes you forget these are actors. Though we begin by warming up to the ethnic/race differences among the players, soon enough, Amin skirts their inter-racial conflicts behind the uniform, the great leveller." {{cite web

|location=London}}  Jaspreet Pandohar of BBC gave Chak De! India 4 out of 5 stars stating that, "while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahnis screenplay-offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket. But its not the type of bat and ball, or the number of practice sessions that are at issue here. Instead, the gender and personal prejudices of the players underpin the story." {{cite web

}}  Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars and describes it as "A rare mainstream Indian movie without musical numbers (though it features original songs), Shimit Amin and Jaideep Sahnis inspirational sports drama shoulders an unusually heavy thematic load, including the quest for personal redemption of a disgraced athlete, second-rate treatment of womens teams and the need for modern India to set aside inter-state and -faith rivalries in favor of loyalty to a united nation."  Derek Elley of Variety (magazine)|Variety describes the film as "a patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals" and that it "is almost an anthem for Indias new-found economic clout and its recent 60th-anniversary celebrations of independence from U.K. rule – and it gets a stirring title song from composing team Salim-Sulaiman and lyricist Jaideep Sahni (who also scripted). Thus, its hardly a surprise when the team of 16 girls from all over India finally get it together to beat the bejeezus out of their international opponents." {{cite web

===Box office===
Upon release, the film recorded a below average opening in India. This lower-than-expected occupancy level was an outcome of its limited release in various territories including West Bengal.  However, due to the strong critical response the film received, collections increased with the final outcome of over 80% occupancy for the weekend.  Subsequently, Chak De! India was granted tax exemptions by the state of Bihar (which reduced tickets prices).  The films box office collections increased and it eventually grossed   in its first week.  By the end of its theatrical run, Chak De! India became the third highest grossing film of 2007 in India, with revenues of   domestically. {{cite web
