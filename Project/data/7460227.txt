The Bridge is a 2006 drama film directed by filmmaker Brett Hanover.   

A fictional story of involvement and disillusionment with Scientology, the film explicitly uses Scientology terms throughout,  as well as including clips from actual Scientology promotional and training videos. It was released as free use media to the Internet in September 2006 by the filmmaker.    

The brochure of the Indie Memphis film festival stated that The Bridge was the "first feature film" about the Church Of Scientology.     While it is set against the background of the Church of Scientology and the Sea Org, the characters and situations depicted are fictional.

 Clear and gives her a Clear bracelet. After the celebration, he takes the bracelet away (but reminds her that she may purchase one of her own as they are not free) and shows her a film that encourages her to continue on the Bridge by taking the Operating Thetan courses at Flag. Late in the night, while she is cleaning, a distraught Richard comes by and asks if he can talk to anyone about being allowed into the funeral service. She refuses, but Richard insists on dropping off some old Scientology books and tapes that used to belong to Amy. Diane listens to one of Amys cassettes from the high–level Clearwater Scientology center and hears a mans voice speaking scoldingly about being "willing to talk to the auditor", in an impenetrable jargon laden with nonsense words.
 security check to determine whether she has any doubts or ill will toward Scientology.

Richard calls Amys mother, who is still in Scientology and asks to be allowed at the funeral. She refuses and ends the call to avoid being sent to ethics. In the evening, Robert reminds Diane of the need to continue up the Bridge, and mentions the Wall of Fire at OT III. That night, disillusioned after returning to a room which earlier she was prevented from entering (being told it is a fully furnished office for the return of L. Ron Hubbard) and discovering it is merely a closet, Diane walks out the door of the church and leaves Scientology. The film ends with a written dedication: "For all who speak out — for those who have been silenced."

== Production ==
The film was produced and directed by Brett Hanover;   a native of Memphis, Tennessee.    At the time of the films release, Hanover was an 18-year–old student.  His studies in college focused on film.  Former Scientologists were involved in the production of the film;    in addition to critics of Scientology associated with Operation Clambake.   Hanover noted the film was an original script which he wrote along with his assistant director.     They wrote the script prior to eliciting input from others.   Prominent critics of Scientology later assisted with funding, input, and acting roles in the film.     The film production took place in Tennessee.  Hanover filmed The Bridge over a total period of six days, for a production budget of United States dollar|US$600.00. 

== Distribution ==
The Bridge premiered at the Operation Clambake 10-year anniversary in Stavanger, Norway on September 2, 2006.  Operation Clambake stated of the premiere, "We are especially excited for the movie The Bridge ... The world premiere in Stavanger is a great honor".  It was shown at the 9th annual Indie Memphis Film Festival in October 2006,    as a feature presentation. 

Hanover released copies of the film in 2006, to Google Video and Internet Archive.    The film credits stated: "The Bridge is licensed as royalty–free digital media, and may be distributed online for personal viewing without permission. All offline distribution rights are reserved by Brett Hanover."  

==Director requests removal of film from Internet==
Jeannette Walls reported in an MSNBC entertainment column that the film had been removed from the Internet.    MSNBC quoted journalist and scientology critic Mark Bunker,   who stated, "It appears that Scientology has hired investigators to dig up dirt on Brett Hanover to shudder him into silence. They have succeeded."  In a case study on fair use, Jackson West of NewTeeVee cited the removal of the film from the Internet as an example of "a worst–case scenario of inappropriate behavior by a wealthy rightsholder toward work critical of that rightsholder".   

A few weeks after the films release to the Internet, Hanover requested its removal, stating on his website, "due to copyright issues, I ask that this film be withdrawn from circulation ... Do not contact me concerning this film, I am no longer supporting it."    This statement itself by Hanover and all references to the film were subsequently removed from his website.  The Internet Archive removed the film from its site, stating there were rights issues involved;  YouTube and Google also removed copies of the film from their websites,  but the film has since been reposted by other users, and has not been removed again. 

==Reception==
Cory Doctorow reviewed the film for Boing Boing, and commented, "Its not a bad movie — it moves a little slow, some of the dialog is stilted, but not bad for an indie feature shot in five days, and the information about the Church jibes with my own research into its practices."  Chris Davis of Memphis Flyer wrote, "This locally produced feature directed by Brett Hanover uses materials created by the Church of Scientology and stories told by former members of L. Ron Hubbards controversial sci–fi religion to build a tragic narrative about misplaced faith and insidious fraud. Scientologists will hate it. People who hate Scientologists wont like it nearly as much as the Tom Cruise episode of South Park."  The Commercial Appeal characterized the film as a "fact–based dramatization of life inside the Church of Scientology". 
 American skeptic and activist freethought|freethinker, Jim Lippard, recommended the film stating, "Watch it, its pretty well done."
