===My Night at Mauds===
An often quoted line from Night Moves occurs when Moseby declines an invitation from his wife to see the movie  s New York Times obituary in 2010.  Penn himself was an admirer of Rohmers films;  Jim Emerson has written that, "Harrys remark, as scripted by Alan Sharp, is a brittle homophobic jab at a gay friend of his wifes."  Bruce Jackson has written an extended discussion of the role of My Night at Mauds (1970) in Night Moves; viewers familiar with the earlier film may recognize that its protagonist and Moseby have related opportunities for infidelity, but respond differently.

==Critical response==
Night Moves continues to attract critical attention long after its release. Film critic   (1967), which is now considered a classic by most critics. 

Griffiths appearance in the movie also garnered particular controversy. The actress shot several racy nude scenes that were featured in the film. This was notable as she was only 17 years old at the time. 

Night Moves has been classified by some critics as a "neo-noir" film, representing a further development of the film noir detective story.  Ronald Schwartz summarizes its role: "Harry Moseby is a man with limitations and weaknesses, a new dimension for detectives in the 1970s. Gone are the Philip Marlowes and tough-guy private investigators who have tremendous insight into crime and can triumph over criminals because they carry within them a code of honor. Harry cannot fathom what honor is, much less be subsumed by it."
