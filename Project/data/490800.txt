==Plot==

===Magnetic Rose===
The Corona, a deep space salvage freighter, is out on a mission when it encounters a distress signal and responds to it. They come upon a spaceship graveyard orbiting a giant space station. The crews two engineers, Heintz and Miguel, enter it to get a closer look.

Once inside, they discover an opulent European interior and several furnished rooms (in varying states of decay), but find no signs of life. They discover that the station belongs to a once famous opera diva named Eva Friedel who disappeared after the murder of her fiancé, Carlo Rambaldi, a fellow singer. Continuing the search for the source of the signal, the engineers split up, with each experiencing paranormal encounters, including strange noises and visions of Eva. Miguel enters the dilapidated underbelly of the station, and in a cavernous chamber he finds a broken piano playing the distress signal. He begins to hallucinate and Eva suddenly runs up to kiss him.
 AI hologram of Eva to malfunction.

The Corona has been struggling against a powerful magnetic field coming from the station, pulling the ship towards it. In desperation, they fire a powerful energy cannon, gouging the structure deep enough to reach the cavern. Heintz is ejected into space (along with Evas past victims), as Eva hauntingly sings to a conjured audience. The Corona is crushed and becomes part of the rose-like shape around the station. The episode ends with the whereabouts of real (and deceased) Eva being shown, and the robot "Eva" talking romantically with a hypnotized Miguel. Heintz is last seen drifting in space, still alive.

 Japanese policy to take over the operation, and calls in a NASA unit with space suits to try and capture Nobuo alive. Unaware of this operation, the Japanese army collapses part of the bridge to prevent Nobuo from escaping, trapping him in a tunnel. They turn on wind generators loaded with liquid nitrogen in an attempt to freeze him. Tanaka becomes scared, disabling the machines while leaving the three astronauts unscathed. The soldiers force Tanaka into an exosuit and bring him back to military headquarters in Tokyo. Tanaka makes his way through the headquarters building, unaware that he is the source of the biological contamination. He then opens his exosuit, killing everyone.

===Cannon Fodder===
In a walled city perpetually at war, everyones livelihood depends upon maintaining and firing the enormous cannons that make up most of the city. Nearly every building in the city is equipped with a cannon of varying size, able to fire huge artillery shells over the city walls. The story is centered on a young boy and his father, who works as a lowly cannon-loader.

The city is surrounded by clouds of smoke and dust provoked by the shots fired by the cannons. Despite news of successful bombardment of the "enemy moving city" by the local media, there is not any visual confirmation that it is true, or even if there is an enemy at all.

In the end the boy comes home from school and hears a television news reporter talking about the near-destruction of the enemy city. The boy hops into his bed, saying that someday he wants to be the exalted officer who fires the cannons, and not be a simple worker like his father. As he sleeps, a blue light sweeps across the window.

==Production details==

==Reception==
In 2001, Animage|Animage magazine ranked Memories 68th in their list of the 100 greatest anime productions.  The film was met with positive reviews, although reception for each of the three stories varied. "Magnetic Rose" has generally been deemed the best episode,              with critics at Anime Meta-Review and T.H.E.M Anime saying it alone made the film worth watching.         Anime Academy thought it was "a pure symphonic treat from start to finish” and “running only forty-five minutes, it can still be compared with the greatest anime productions in every single aspect from animation to storyline."  John Wallis of DVD Talk called it "a great opener, a strong, moving story of love, loss, haunting heartbreak, and horror chills."    “Magnetic Rose” was also regarded as "a science fiction marvel" by Homemademech’s Mark McPherson, who praised its dialogue and realistic presentation of outer space physics.    Chris Beveridge from Mania.com, however, felt that the story had "some feel of being done before to some degree."   

Comments on "Stink Bomb" and "Cannon Fodder" were less favorable. T.H.E.M Anime reviewer Carlos Ross stated that "the other two entries dont quite equal the sheer excellence of ‘Magnetic Rose’".  McPherson referred to "Stink Bomb" by saying "compared to the other episodes of Memories, its the weakest and less creative of the bunch",  while Anime Jump’s Chad Clayton thought "Cannon Fodder" did not "match the complexity of the preceding two films."  "Stink Bomb" was nonetheless praised for its humour and high quality visuals.        "Cannon Fodder" was viewed as "the strongest work in terms of its allegorical message" by DVD Talk,  and visually "inventive" by both Anime Jump and Anime Academy.   Tasha Robinson at Sci Fi Channel (United States)|SciFi.com described the animation of every episode as "stellar", claiming the film as a whole went "well beyond memorable".
