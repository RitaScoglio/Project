Old School is a 2003 American comedy film released by DreamWorks Pictures and The Montecito Picture Company and directed by Todd Phillips.  The story was written by Court Crandall, and the film was written by Phillips and Scot Armstrong.  The film stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as three depressed thirty-somethings who seek to re-live their college days by starting a Fraternities and sororities|fraternity, and the tribulations they encounter in doing so.

==Plot==
Attorney Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) breaks up with his girlfriend when he accidentally discovers that she takes part in orgy|orgies. Mitch encounters his high school crush, Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), at the wedding of his friend Frank (Will Ferrell) and makes an awkward impression. Later, he finds a house located near the campus of the fictional Harrison University in New York.

Mitchs other friend Bernard ( ), who is now the College "Dean". He informs them that they must vacate because Mitchs house has been designated exclusively for campus housing. Bernard proposes starting a fraternity that is open to anyone to meet the Deans criteria of campus housing. The new fraternity carries out several hazing events throughout campus, attracting the attention of the Dean and other members of the faculty.

Nicole brings her boyfriend Mark to the party for one of Bernards children and Mitch walks in on him in the bathroom in a clinch with a girl from the catering firm. While initially discreet, Mitch is forced to recount the entire incident to Nicole when Mark tries to lie that the girl was with Mitch instead of himself. The most elderly fraternity member, Blue, has a heart attack and collapses during a "lube wrestling" match with two good-looking college girls at his birthday celebration. At Blues funeral, Franks wife says she wants a divorce, forcing Frank to live with Mitch.

Plotting revenge against the group, Dean Pritchard bribes the Student Council President, Megan Huang, until she agrees to revoke the fraternitys charter. By video, he claims that the group is violating university policies subjecting the students in the non-sanctioned fraternity to expulsion. Mitch finds out that the group has the right to bypass the Deans ruling if all of their members complete activities that include academic tests, public debates and athletics to prove their legitimacy.

The men are able to complete all of the activities successfully with an 84% average. However, Pritchard tells them that their average has dropped to a failing 58% after accounting for the absence of the deceased member Blue. While the students are in despair, Megan arrives with tape recorded evidence of the Deans bribery. After a chase, Frank obtains the tape and uses it to get the Dean fired. The fraternity’s charter is reinstated and the fraternity moves into Dean Pritchard’s old house.

Nicole visits Mitch, intent on moving their relationship forward. Despite Bernard and Mitch withdrawing from the fraternity, Frank maintains his ties as leader. Mark and the Dean come to a bad end in the closing credits.

==Sequel==
In 2006, a sequel to Old School was written by Scot Armstrong but was turned down by original stars, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. The story concerned the aging fraternity going to Spring Break. While promoting Semi-Pro in 2008, Ferrell had this to say about the defunct project: “I read  . Some super funny set pieces, but I don’t know. I think Vince   had the same reaction. We’re just kind of doing the same thing again. It was like us going to Spring Break, but we’ve got to find this guy who’s the head of a fraternity. Once again, funny things but it’s just us once again back in a fraternity setting. It just felt like it was repeating. But watch, I’m over-thinking it.”
