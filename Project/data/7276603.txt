La Furia del Hombre Lobo (Fury of the Wolfman), also known as  The Wolfman Never Sleeps, is a 1970 Spanish horror film that is the fourth in a long series about the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky, played by Paul Naschy. It was not released until 1972, due to problems involved in finding a distributor.

This was the first film to involve a yeti as the catalyst that transforms Waldemar into a werewolf (the "yeti origin" appearing again in La Maldicion de la Bestia in 1975).  Naschy followed this film up with a sequel called La Noche de Walpurgis (1970), which became the highest-grossing film in the series.

==Plot summary==
College professor Waldemar Daninsky travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed while trying to escape after murdering his cheating wife and her lover, but he is later revived by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ehrmann, who uses him in her mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers her underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of her failed experiments. The crazed scientist revives Waldemars murdered ex-wife, who also becomes a werewolf from being fatally bitten by Daninsky, and forces the two werewolves to fight. Waldemar kills his wife once again, and is in turn shot to death by the doctors assistant, a woman who loves him enough to end his torment.

The plot of this film differed from the earlier entries in the series in that 1) Daninsky is a college professor in this film, 2) the lycanthropy is caused by a yetis bite, and 3) Daninsky is married in this film. Due to the laziness of director Zabalza, this film wound up including a lot of stock footage from La Marca del Hombre Lobo and a few carelessly mismatched werewolf scenes played by a stunt double.
