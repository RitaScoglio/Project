He seems to have escaped pursuit until they tail him again and the car hightails into a river. Kool starts to narrate his story, telling the audience "Im not surprised this road is ending, Ive been on this road to nowhere for a while. My name is Kool, they say Im a thug...I say I was made into one." as the movie flashes back 6 months earlier.

Kool has made his transition from a brown belt to a black belt. The movie then skips to the next day and introduces Tyrel (Mystikal) and he is arguing with C-Dawg about Mike Tyson biting Holyfields ear off in the boxing match.

The movie cuts to an office at the LAPD precinct. Officer Mack (Brent Huff) is interrupted from his work by Maurice (Maurice Lamont) and Mack tries to tell him that the deal is off due to there being an undercover cop on the deal. Maurice tells Mack that the deal is still on and that hed better be there. The movie jumps back to Kool and LaShawna with Kool telling LaShawna that he had wrote her a song that was going to get them out of the hood and into a better place. Which is interrupted by Tyrel knocking on the door telling Kool to hurry up because something big is about to go down and C-Dawg and Remo are in the middle of it. LaShawna hears Tyrel screaming at the door and she gives Kool the go ahead despite Kool not wanting her to walk home by herself as she is walking home she witnesses a stabbing and discovers the victim is a cop as he dies in her arms, as he dies Officer Mack, who is a dirty cop, brandishes his gun, which causes LaShawna to run away from the crime scene just as help is arriving and LaShawna runs all the way home where she is apprehended and taken into custody. Kool arrives and Eddy (Anthony Boswell) explains that she has just been charged with murder despite he and Kool knowing that she would never kill anyone. Eddy is reluctant to help but cant due to the fact that it isnt his murder case. Kool wants to prove her innocence, and Tully (Gary Busey), the cynical detective in charge, ignores LaShawnas case but uses Kool to break up an incipient crime operation. Which has Saint (Clifton Powell) jailed and LaShawnas certain release. Shes in danger because the guilty parties fear that the officer talked before he died.

While in jail, pregnant with Kools first-born child and awaiting a hearing and legal help, shes beaten to death by Mack. While at LaShawnas funeral, Officer Mack pulls out an Uzi and fires upon the funeral. Kool gets into a hearse and gives chase to Mack, Kool eventually catches up to Mack and destroys the van he is driving, killing him. After being double crossed by a crooked cop and having his girlfriend wrongfully accused of murder and jailed, he begins to find difficulty in ignoring the lure of urban gang-life, Kool vows revenge: the Hot Boyz are born. Kool is eventually pushed over the edge by a pair of racist cops and decides to start his own gang called "Hot Boyz," who turn out to be the toughest new gang in the city. As the Hot Boyz continue their rise of dominance, they are all at a club and Tyrel comes and sits at the bar with them and tells them that Saint gets released from prison at 9 oclock in the morning, Tyrel and Remo insists that they kill him before he puts together another crew and there will be a turf war between Saint and the Hot Boyz. Moe (Master P) is an informant who is helping out Officer Roberts (C. Thomas Howell) with the case at hand, Moe tells Roberts exactly what he wants to know and Moe skips town after it happens. Pee Wee makes a deal with Saint, who lets him in his organization when he told about the hit the Hot Boyz were planning on him. C-Dawg finds out what Pee Wee did, then he and Kool confront him about it. Kool is about to brandish a plane ticket to send Pee Wee to his hometown but Pee Wee, thinking Kool is about to kill him, runs for his own safety and is shot and killed by C-Dawg. Kool reveals that he was going to send him home with a plane ticket. Saint finds the warehouse where the Hot Boyz do their business and has his crew guns drawn and ready to kill anybody, but not only Saints crew, the corrupt police work alongside them. A 10 minute gunfight ensues, in which most of the Hot Boyz are killed or injured. Kool and Tully have a standoff in which Kool wins due to an assist from an injured C-Dawg, and in the end as he jumps out of the window hops into a car and jumps into the river and tells the audience that "There was time when the world was mine, LaShawna, me, and our baby, the future looked so good for me, and now Im on a dead impact and a crash course with destiny. He also tells the audience that its funny when youre thirty-eight feet below, all the guns, and the money in the world doesnt even matter any more, and that you find yourself thinking about the strangest things, I found myself thinking about justice, and that I realized had not found any for myself, I had just been sinking deeper and deeper, and that now all I wonders is if I had any air to get away, will I have anything to live for any more." He tells the audience that "Eventually they found me and I found myself locked in prison for 30 years, without parole until Eddy got me out on a legal loophole after only serving 5 years in prison, I got a second chance to live a good life a life that LaShawna and our baby would have approved of."

As the movie ends it shows flashbacks of LaShawna to the viewer and Kool tells the audience, "That a good life is worth living because as long as I live the memory of LaShawna lives on forever, and that love is something to believe in, and besides all I have now is memories."
