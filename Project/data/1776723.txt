==Production==
The film was a co production between AIP and UKs Anglo-Amalgamated.

Roger Corman was initially reluctant to use Vincent Price in the lead role, being worried he was too old for a character who was 25 to 30 years old; his preference was for Richard Chamberlain. However Prices casting was a condition of AIP investing in the film, and Corman relented. Robert Towne had specifically requested Price not be cast, and when Corman broke the news he told the screenwriter "Don’t worry, Bob, I’ve got Marlene Dietrich’s make-up man!” 

Corman ended up giving Price a wig and using more make up on him than usual to make him look younger but that Prices casting still "did change the orientation of the film quite a bit." 

Filming started at Shepperton Studios on 29 June 1964.

==Reception==
The film was released in the UK by Warner-Pathé on 6 December 1964, with Mario Bavas I tre volti della paura (in its Anglicised version as Black Sabbath) in support.  US release followed on 20 January the following year. 
===Critical===
Howard Thompson in the New York Times of 6 May wrote: Masque of the Red Death ... But the Corman climate of evil is as unhealthy and contagious as ever.  
Roger Corman later said he thought the film was "one of the best Poe pictures and Vincent’s performance in the film was very good. It was simply a matter of age." 
===Box Office===
Roger Corman later claimed that "all of the Poe films made money, but Tomb of Ligeia made the least amount. I think it was because the series was just running out of steam and also because it was overly complicated."   accessed 8 July 2014 

The movie was the last in the Corman AIP Poe cycle until the success of The Witchfinder General encouraged AIP to embark on a fresh cycle of Poe pictures without Cormans involvement.

===Cultural Impact===
Roger Corman gave Martin Scorsese permission to use a clip from the film in Mean Streets.
