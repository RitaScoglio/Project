==Plot==
In 1939 Kingdom of Italy|Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Jewish man who is leaving his old life and going to the city where his uncle lives for work. Guido is comical and sharp, making the best from each situation he encounters. From the start he falls in love with a girl  Dora. Later he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher. Dora is set to be engaged to a rich but arrogant man. He is a local government official with whom Guido has run-ins from the beginning. Guido is still in love with Dora and performs many stunts in order to see her. Guido sets up many "coincidental" incidents to show his interest. Finally Dora sees Guidos affection and promise and gives in against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. Soon they are married and have a son, Giosué. (Joshua in English.)

Through the first part, the film depicts the changing political climate in Italy: Guido frequently imitates members of the   insults. Later during World War II, after Dora and her mother have reconciled, Guido, his Uncle Eliseo and  Giosué are seized on Giosués birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a concentration camp.

In the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to  Giosué that the camp is a complicated game in which  he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Giosué is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue on. Guido sets up the concentration camp as a game for Giosué. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Guido uses this game to explain features of the concentration camp that would otherwise be frightening for a young child: the guards are mean only because they want the tank for themselves; the dwindling numbers of children (who are being killed in gas chambers) are only hiding in order to score more points than Giosué so they can win the game. He puts off Giosués requests to end the game and return home by convincing him that they are in the lead for the tank, and need only wait a short while before they can return home with their tank.
 sweatbox until everybody has left, this being the final competition before the tank is his. As the camp is in chaos Guido goes off to find Dora, but while he is out he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido. Guido is led off by the soldier to be executed. While the soldier is leading him to his death, Guido passes by Giosué one last time, still in character and playing the game. The next morning, Giosué emerges from the sweatbox as the camp is occupied by an American armored division. Giosué thinks he has won the game because Guido had told him that whoever got to one thousand points would get a tank. The captives in the concentration camp emerge from hiding. The prisoners travel to safety, accompanied by the Americans. While they are traveling, the soldiers allow Giosué to ride on the front of the tank with them. Giosué soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp. Giosué and Dora are reunited and are extremely happy to see each other. In the film, Giosué is a young boy; however, both the beginning and ending of the film are narrated by an older Giosué recalling his fathers story of sacrifice for his family.

The film also received mostly positive reviews, with the film aggregator website   gave the film 3 1/2 stars, stating, "At Cannes, it offended some left-wing critics with its use of humor in connection with the Holocaust. What may be most offensive to both wings is its sidestepping of politics in favor of simple human ingenuity. The film finds the right notes to negotiate its delicate subject matter."
