That omission causes that the character interactions in the film are reflected in such a way that the imperial conference between the emperor and his council and the meeting between Hirohito and MacArthur are in fact none of the words related to imperial interpreter Katsuzō Okumuras transcript. As noted by Okumura, the general praised the emperors "august virtue" (miitsu).
