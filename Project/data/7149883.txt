Jonker wrote the script when he was 17 years old and began production a year later, in 1988. After four days of shooting, he abandoned the production.  He returned to it in 1989 with a new cast and a budget under $5000. Jonker finished post-production in 1991, two and a half years after he began it. 

== Reception == cult following for its gore.   Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "Lief Jonkers Darkness is one of the cheapest, silliest, and splatteriest no-budget horror flicks youre ever likely to come across.".   Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict wrote, "Despite any shortcomings, this is a movie made by horror film fans for their peers. You can feel the passion seeping off the screen, and somehow a movie that should be fodder for the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 becomes a rollicking good time." 

Horrorhound.com named it "the goriest vampire film of all time".
