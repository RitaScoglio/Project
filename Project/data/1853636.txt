}} horror science fiction film, written and directed by Jerry Warren.

== Plot == Paul Pepper), Julie (Mitzie Albertson), and Pam (Brianne Murphy), accidentally discover an island  run by a mad scientist named Doctor Myra who, backed by foreign agents from "the East",  intends to turn everyone in the United States into a zombie. The teenagers become trapped on the island, and are temporarily imprisoned in cages.  They are freed when other teenagers arrive with the sheriff (who turns out to be in league with Doctor Myra).  A complicated fight scene serves as the climax, in which a de-zombified gorilla arrives just in time to attack Dr. Myras henchmen and allow the teens to escape.  When they are safely back on the mainland, it is implied that the teens will receive a reward for discovering the island, and will have an audience with the President of the United States.

== Reception ==
* The movie was criticized for its use of stock footage from feature films by Jerry Warren, who later used it in his most famous film, 1981s Frankenstein Island.
* Although water-skiing is repeatedly referenced (and may be implied), there is no actual footage of water-skiing anywhere in the film.
* As with similar zombie-films of this era (such as Bela Lugosis Bowery at Midnight), the zombies in this film are markedly unlike those portrayed in contemporary zombie-films. Instead, the zombies in Teenage Zombies appear like hypnotized persons.
