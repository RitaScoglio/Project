==Plot== football team. They are not doing very well, so the coach (Jake DArcy) holds a trial to find new players, with Gregory being moved to goal. Dorothy (Dee Hepburn), turns up and, despite the coachs sexist misgivings, proves to be a very good player. She subsequently takes Gregorys place as centre forward, and Gregory in turn replaces his friend Andy Robert Buchanan (actor)|(Robert Buchanan) as goalkeeper.

Gregory is all for her making the team, as he finds her very attractive. However, he has to compete for her attention with all the other boys who share the same opinion. Gregory initially confides in his best friend Steve (William Greenlees), the most mature of Gregorys circle of friends, and asks him for help in attracting Dorothy. Steve, however, is unable to assist him.

When they get there, she hands him off to another friend, Margo (Carol Macartney), and leaves. By this point, he is rather confused, but goes for a walk with the new girl. On their stroll, they encounter a waiting Susan (Clare Grogan), another of Dorothys friends, and Margo leaves. Susan confesses that it was all arranged by her friends, including Dorothy. She explains, "Its just the way girls work. They help each other."

They go to the park and talk. At the dates end, Gregory is more than pleased with the girl he ended up with, and the two kiss numerous times on his doorstep before calling it a night and arranging a second date. Madeleine, Gregorys sister, who had been watching from the window, quizzes him on his date.

Gregorys friends, Andy and Charlie (Graham Thompson), are even more inept with girls but see Gregory at various times with three different apparent dates, and are envious of his seeming success. They try to hitchhike to Caracas, where Andy has heard the women greatly outnumber the men, but fail at that as well.

==Production==
Many of the young actors were members of the Glasgow Youth Theatre, and had appeared in Forsyths earlier film, That Sinking Feeling (1980), including Robert Buchanan, Billy Greenlees, and John Gordon Sinclair. Hepburn was spotted by Forsyth dancing in a television commercial for a Scottish department store,    and after casting given six weeks of intensive football training at Partick Thistle F.C.   

Filming of exterior scenes at Gregorys school took place at Abronhill High School. As the film had a small budget, the actors supplied many of their own clothes; Hepburns white shorts were borrowed from her sister. A person in a penguin costume is seen at various points in the film for no apparent reason. Inside the suit was Christopher Higson, son of production supervisor Paddy Higson.

The film was Dubbing (filmmaking)|re-dubbed with rather Anglicized Scottish accents for the original American theatrical release. Both versions are available on the American DVD release.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic Roger Ebert liked the films direction, and wrote "Bill Forsyths Gregorys Girl is a charming, innocent, very funny little movie about the weird kid. ... The movie contains so much wisdom about being alive and teenage and vulnerable that maybe it would even be painful for a teenager to see it. ... Maybe only grown-ups should see this movie. You know, people who have gotten over the pains of unrequited love (hollow laugh)." 

The staff at Variety (magazine)|Variety liked the work of the young cast and Forsyths direction, and wrote, "Filmmaker Bill Forsyth, whose friendly, unmalicious approach recalls that of René Clair, is concerned with young students (in particular, a soccer team goalie, Gregory) seeking out the opposite sex. ... As Gregory, John Gordon Sinclair is adept at physical comedy. Hepburn is properly enigmatic as the object of his desire, with ensemble approach giving Gregs precocious 10-year-old sister played by Allison Forster a key femme role." 

Critic Richard Skorman wrote, "Forsyth does a good job of making light of the tender part in   teenage psyche, and his friends and little sister in particular are quirky and lovable. Unlike the films American counterparts, Gregorys Girl is refreshingly free of mean-spirited characters and horny young studs bemoaning their virginity." 

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 92% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on thirteen reviews."
