Souls at Sea is a 1937 American adventure film directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Gary Cooper, George Raft, and Frances Dee. Based on a story by Ted Lesser, the film is about a first mate on a slave ship who frees the slaves on the ship after a mutiny overthrows the ships captain. The title of this film was spoofed in the Laurel and Hardy comedy film Saps at Sea (1940). The film was nominated for three Academy Awards.   

==Plot==
The story is based on two distinct early 19th-century themes, including the attempts by abolitionists (Cooper and Raft) to end the slave trade.  Although the U.S. Constitution ended the importation of slaves in 1808, slaves were still being brought into the country under foreign flags.  The abolition of slavery by Great Britain helped reduce legal trade in slaves by putting the British navy into action against slave traders, but even Britain had its supporters of the trade (here represented by Wilcoxon, as a British naval officer acting for the slave interests).  The collision between Cooper and Wilcoxon is complicated by Wilcoxons sister (Dee) falling in love with Cooper.
 William Brown. An actual ship involved in a sea tragedy of this period (the Jacksonian Age of the 1820s to 1840s), the  William Brown hit an iceberg on April 19, 1841, and sank with loss of life. Here it catches fire, due to a little girl, and the ships captain (Carey) is injured. Cooper taking over has to limit the number of people in the only lifeboat, and as a result is put on trial for murder (and defended by Zucco). In real life a seaman, one Alexander Holmes, was tried and convicted of manslaughter, but given only a fine and six months imprisonment. A later film with Tyrone Power called Seven Waves Away (also known as Abandon Ship!) (1957) dealt with the issue of the limits of lifeboat space and decisions of the first mate.
