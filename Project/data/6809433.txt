After the success of Kadhal Kottai (1996) and Kaalamellam Kadhal Vaazhga (1997), Sivashakthi Pandian announced he was set to make another love story Kaadhale Nimmadhi, written and directed by newcomer Rajan, who gave himself the stagename of Indiran.  The d√©butante lead actress, Jeevitha Sharma, a fifteen-year-old at the time, was noticed by producer Sivashakthi Pandian in his search for a new heroine for the film. The producer also opened a contest in Kumudam magazine to rename Jeevitha and give her a stage name to suit Tamil tastes and traditions. She was later christened as Kavitha by the producer before the films release. 

==Release==
A critic from Indolink.com gave the film a positive review suggesting that audiences should "treat themselves to this movie, which is completely suitable for the entire family", though the critic claims that Suriya "again shows his inability to act" but praises the performances of Manivannan and Raadhika Sarathkumar|Raadhika.  The film did not do well at the box-office.
