}} adapted from film of the same name) about mobster Chili Palmers entrance into the film industry.

The film adaptation of Be Cool began production in 2003. It was directed by F. Gary Gray, produced by Danny DeVito (who produced and co-starred in the first film), and starred John Travolta, reprising his role from the first film. The film opened in March 2005 to generally mixed reviews,  and was released to video and DVD distribution on June 7, 2005. This was Robert Pastorellis final film, as he died one year before its theatrical release.

==Plot==
Chili Palmer (John Travolta) helps Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), the widow of an executed friend, Tommy Athens (James Woods), to resurrect a record company using the talents of young and talented female vocalist and songwriter, Linda Moon (Christina Milian). The plot is complicated by several facts:
* In a loan-shark subplot from Get Shorty of "who owns who", Chili makes deals and owns all the players as a "producer".
* The Russian Mafia (headed by Alex Kubik as Roman Bulkin) are trying to kill Chili because he witnessed the execution of Athens.
* Athens record company owes money to a gangster/producer, Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer).
 The Rock), homophobic jokes. Carr and Raji take exception to Chilis intervention, and hire a hitman, Joe "Loop" Lupino (Robert Pastorelli) to kill Chili. In the meantime, Chili convinces Edie to produce Moon, hoping to resurrect Athens failing record company through a live performance with Steven Tyler and Aerosmith.
 George Fisher), the Russian Mob hitman. Raji then kills Loop with a bat after Loop "disrespects" him. After Chili talks Linda into leaving Carr and his girl group, Carr tries to trick Chili by handing him a pawn ticket, claiming that Lindas contract was at the pawn shop owned by the Russians. This is actually a set-up by Carr to get Chili killed.

Knowing about this trick, Chili hands the ticket to Edie, who turns it over to the police. Now the cops, instead of Chili, pay the Russians a visit. Believing that Carr tricked him, Bulkin and his men pay a visit to Carrs office while Sin LaSalle and the DubMDs are there. Insulted by Bulkins racist remarks, LaSalle kills him. In the meantime, Raji sends Elliot to kill Chili. However, Chili befriends Elliot and tells him that he can help him out with his acting career. When Carr threatens Chili, Chili sends him to the hands of the police with a pawn ticket. Finally when Raji and Elliot threaten Chili, Chili again befriends Elliot, who turns on Raji after learning that Chili had gotten him an audition for a film and Raji erased the evidence of it on his answering machine. For all his smooth talking and flamboyant wardrobe, Raji finds himself in a firework conflagration which roasts him live on camera. Carr is arrested on murder charges when they find him with the bat used to kill Joe Loop.

During all of this confusion, Chili squeezes in a dance scene with Edie (a nod to his "Twist Contest" scene, also with Thurman, in Pulp Fiction) and Moon gets her debut with Aerosmith. Finally, LaSalle becomes the producer for Moon and Elliot embarks on a successful acting career (his first film is with Nicole Kidman).

==Release==
===Box office===
On a production budget of $53 million, Be Cool grossed $56,046,979 in North American and $39,169,077 internationally, totaling up to $95,216,056 worldwide.

===Critical reception===
Be Cool received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 30% based on reviews from 169 critics, with an average 4.6/10 rating. 

Halliwell  called it "a palpable miss, a movie so lazy and laid back that it falls over; there are none of those insights ... that made Get Shorty so enjoyable". 

==Inside jokes==
Like Get Shorty, Be Cool portrays ironic self-referential gags, intertwining fact and fiction as a comedic device: film within a film he produced in Get Shorty. He expresses his distaste for sequels, as well as his dissatisfaction in failing to prevent Get Lost from being made, despite the fact he himself is a character in a sequel. The first line of the movie is Chili disgustedly dismissing the advertisement.
* Tommy proposes the idea of making a movie about a young singer who wants to make herself big with the help of a record mogul who makes it happen which becomes the main plot of the film at hand. Almost every factor Tommy mentioned in his pitch, such as gangsta rappers and the Russian Mafia, ends up happening in the film. American Beauty." Sunset Boulevard." "Or Casino (film)|Casino." Well, Tommy was shot in early part of the movie, if not the first scene.
* When the idea is brought up to Steven Tyler, he vehemently rejects the possibility of being in a film and declares that he is not one of those singers who does bit-part cameos in films, despite the fact that that is exactly what he is doing in this film.
* The one time the word fuck is used in the film is in talking about the Motion Picture Association of Americas policy that said curse word can only be used once without censorship in a PG-13 film without bumping the rating up to R. Be Cool uses that word only once, in the first scene: "Do you know that unless youre willing to use the R rating, you can only say the F-word once? You know what I say: Fuck that. Im done." For the rest of the film, several characters come close to using this swear word but are cut off or censored in some way before they can.
* The dancing scene between John Travolta and Uma Thurman is reminiscent of the one they portrayed in Pulp Fiction.
