==Plot==
Valentino plays Count Rodrigo Torriani, an Italian noble. A charming libertine, his weakness is women â€“ the "cobras" referred to in the title of the film.

Roridgo accepts an invitation from friend Jack Dorning (Ferguson) to come to New York City to work as an antiques expert. While the job is rewarding, Rodrigo finds the temptation from the women surrounding him, including Dornings secretary Mary Drake (Olmstead) and wife Elise (Naldi) challenging.

When Jack is away, Elise reveals to Rodrigo that she is still in love with him. The two arrange to meet at a hotel. However, at the last minute, Rodrigo remembers he cannot betray his friend and refuses to go to the rendezvous. It turns out to be a wise decision; the hotel burns to the ground in the middle of the night, killing Elise.

Rodrigo desperately wants a relationship with Mary. However, after Elises death, he turns Marys attentions toward Jack and decides to leave New York. The film ends with Rodrigo gazing out at the sea and the Statue of Liberty as he sets sail back to Europe.
 The Eagle.

Cobra has survived and has been made available to the public, on both VHS and DVD, by independent film dealers and major movie distributors.
