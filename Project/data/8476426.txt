Téchiné took the title of his film from the work Barroco (1974) written by Severo Sarduy, a Cuban poet and cultural theorist exiled in Paris. Marshall, André Téchiné, p. 21   
The director was also inspired by the Baroque painting, the Exchange of Princesses (1621–1625) by Rubens, in which one figure is becoming the copy of the other. 

==Production==
Téchinés third feature had a bigger budget than Souvenirs the France, his previous film, and was produced by Alain Sarde with finance from Les Films de la Boetie, which made many of Claude Chabrols films of the period, and Sara Films.  The screenplay was written by Téchiné with Marilyn Goldin, they had collaborated also in Souvenirs den France.  Barocco was shot in Amsterdam.
