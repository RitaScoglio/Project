== Production ==
Pirate movies had gone out of fashion with major Hollywood studios since the 1950s, due in part to high cost. The success of The Three Musketeers (1973) showed there was still an appetite for swashbucklers, so original producer Eliot Kastner prepared a pirate script where most of the action took place on shore. 

"It was prepared to avoid all the hazards of filming on water and it could have been inexpensively made," said co producer Jennings Lang. "But we decided that it would be cheating the public to do a pirate movie without boats, that would not be using the basic material." 

Anjelica Huston was cast for her role over Martine Beswicke and Barbara Steele. Anjelicas Visage Wins Role How the West Was Won (1963), played a one legged pirate. The Pirate Has Heart: MURRAYS COLUMN

The working title for the film was Swashbuckler, which was changed during production to The Blarney Cock. "We want to avoid the movie being considered a kids picture," said Lang. ""We wanted a title that is arresting to adults as well as kids. This ship in the movie is called "The Blarney Cock", so we decided to make use of that name as the title." A Reel-Life Swashbuckler.

Before release, however, Universal had a change of heart about the suggestive nature of the title and it was reverted to Swashbuckler. Whats in a Name? Ask the Research Department: Whats in a Name? Ask the Research Department

Director James Goldstone stated during filming:
 Were not doing a boffo comedy. We are not making fun of ourselves. One of the cardinal rules here is that every actor really believe what he is doing could actually happen... I hope to evoke all those feelings that audiences felt when they first saw Errol Flynns movies, but at the same time I realise that if you saw an actual Errol Flynn movie today, marvelous as they were, youd laugh. My job here is to keep the energy up, the motion moving forward, to maintain a level of joy.  
The film was shot in Mexico and on the galleon Golden Hind, a replica of the Golden Hind captained by Francis Drake from 1577 to 1580, which had set up residence in San Francisco Harbour after a five month journey from England. Swashbuckler Opening Set
Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File)   23 July 1976: f17.   According to the Special Feature section of the DVD, it was the only pirate movie filmed aboard an actual ship of that era.

"I just hope the audience doesnt think its too small," said Goldstone during production about the ship. "All those Errol Flynn movies - the captains table was 17 feet long. There are parts of our ship that arent even that wide." 
Costume director Burton Miller said:
 Instead of researching the period, I took on producer Jennings Langs challenge for a non-historical approach and started walking along the   Strip. I took what groupies and rock stars wear today and took it back 200 years... The film offered more avenues for self expression that anything Id ever done before. Universal were very generous  .

Robert Shaw said during filming:
 Im underplaying this part when all the others are overplaying. Im trying to be real but Im also trying to find some sort of contemporary style. Its a mix between 1976 and what we used to call panache. Its as if you were to do Gary Cooper in 76 - I stand apart and alone. In Jaws I was conscious of overplaying. Im not ashamed of it. I had to bring those American guys up to a certain pitch of energy. But here Im taking it down and trying to go in the other way. Trying to be real in an unreal situation. I hate all this action, I loathe it. What am I doing running around like this? Im better off sitting down, playing a scene like Im talking to you. What I know about life is a fair bit, but it is not contained in sword fights or running up and down the masts of a ship or taking a punch. Its doubly hard because Im English. English actors are always being asked to play princes or generals or pirate captains. I never get to sit in a booth with a girl and have a conversation.
