When Doug returns, he is shocked to find boys from every walk of life interested in dating Katie. Janet suggests that Doug needs psychiatric help when his obsession with Katie and her boyfriends reaches extreme limits, and Doug seeks out an expert who gives him advice that goes wrong whenever Doug applies it. Throughout the latter half of the film, Katie maintains three boyfriends, two of whom she eventually stops dating.

===Critical response===
Based on 19 reviews, Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 11%. 

When Chicago film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel reviewed the film on their program Siskel & Ebert, Siskel revealed that after viewing the film, he became so depressed that he considered quitting his job as a movie critic, but he saw the film Say Anything... on the same day, a film he liked very much and he declared that "all was right with the world, Im still on the job."  Ebert gave the film the rare zero stars rating on his written review of the film,  saying:

 What planet did the makers of this film come from? What assumptions do they have about the purpose and quality of life? I ask because Shes Out of Control is simultaneously so bizarre and so banal that its a first: the first movie fabricated entirely from sitcom cliches and plastic lifestyles, without reference to any known plane of reality. 

Leonard Maltin also panned the film, stating that it was a "superficial expanded sitcom with Danza offering a one-note performance," concluding with "this one seems as if it was spit out of a computer."   

The film was remade in  .
