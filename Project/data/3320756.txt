==Toys==
Hasbro also released a Valor vs. Venom toyline in 2004, to correspond with the characters from the movie. A second wave of Valor vs. Venom figures was released in 2005.

The following 3 &nbsp;inch collection was to be called G.I. Joe: Robot Revolution, and would have featured the Joes against Cobra robots and cyborgs. That toyline would likely have had its own movie, as a sequel to Valor vs. Venom, but the toyline was replaced by the 8-inch   toyline in 2006. However, Sigma 6 also deals with cybernetically-enhanced Cobras.
