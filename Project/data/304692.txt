==Plot==
 
Japanese middle school student Shuya Nanahara copes with life after his fathers suicide. Meanwhile, schoolmate Noriko Nakagawa is the only student attending class 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being impulsively attacked by a student.

One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip, but they are gassed, fitted with electronic collars, and sent to a "briefing room" on a remote island. Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school. A cheerful orientation video instructs the class they have three days to kill each other until only one remains. The explosive collars will kill any uncooperative students or those within daily "danger zones". Kitano kills two students for misbehavior during the video, including Shuyas best friend, Nobu. Each student is provided a bag of food and water, map of the island, compass, and a weapon ranging in efficiency from firearms to a paper fan.

The programs first six hours see twelve deaths, two by suicide. Mitsuko Souma and mute transfer student Kazuo Kiriyama soon become the most dangerous players, while another transfer student, Shogo Kawada, seems somewhat more merciful. Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the militarys computer system. Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe, because his friend secretly loved her. Shuya carries Noriko to a clinic after she collapses, where they encounter Kawada, who reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, whose death he seeks to avenge. When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs off as a distraction. Although saved by another student, he is wounded.

Shuya awakens in the islands lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him. Five other girls from her clique have also been hiding out in the building, including Yuko Sakaki, who attempts to poison Shuya only for another girl to accidentally eat the food. Yuko is the only survivor of the resulting shootout; despondent, she apologises to Shuya and commits suicide. Shuya returns to Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura. Of the seven students remaining, all except Kiriyama are attempting or willing to subvert the game. Mimura and two others infiltrate the militarys computer system, but Kiriyama finds and kills them. When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers burning base, Kawada confronts and kills Kiriyama, who had been blinded by an explosion rigged by Mimura as he was killed.

On the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars internal microphones, takes Shuya and Noriko aside and fakes their deaths. Suspicious, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops, intent on personally killing the supposed victor. Kitano realizes that Kawada had hacked into the games system months beforehand, and has now disabled Shuya and Norikos tracking devices. The three survivors confront Kitano in the headquarters, and he unveils a disturbing homemade painting of the massacred class that depicts Noriko as sole survivor. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter. He confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter and asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots Kitano after he threatens Noriko with a gun. As he falls, Kitano shoots, revealing that it is a water gun.  As he dies, Kitano angrily takes a call from his daughter and rebukes her.

==Production==

===Creative process===
Kinji Fukasaku stated that he decided to direct the film because the novel it was adapted from reminded him of his time as a 15-year-old munitions factory worker during World War II. At that time, his class was made to work in a munitions factory. In July 1945, the factory came under artillery fire. The children could not escape so they dived under each other for cover. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses. At that point, Fukasaku realised that the Japanese government was lying about World War II, and he developed a burning hatred of adults in general that he maintained for a long time afterwards.   

Beat Takeshi told a documentary crew during filming that he believes "an actors job is to satisfy the director... I move the way Im told to. I try to look the way Im told to. I dont know much about the emotional side", before adding, "Mr. Fukasaku told me to play myself. I did not really understand, but he told me to play myself, as I ordinarily would be! Im just trying to do what he tells me." 

When asked in an interview with The Midnight Eye if the film is "a warning or advice to the young", Kinji Fukasaku responded by describing the words "warning" and "advice" as "sounding very strong to me" as if they were actions which one tries to accomplish; therefore the film would not be "particularly a warning or advice." Fukasaku explained that the film, which he describes as "a fable", includes themes, such as crime by young people, which in Japan "are very much real modern issues." Fukasaku said that he did not have a lack of concern or a lack of interest; he used the themes as part of his fable. When the interviewer told Fukasaku that he asked the question specifically because of the word "run" in the concluding text, which the interviewer described as "very positive", Fukasaku explained that he developed the concept throughout the film. Fukasaku interpreted the interviewers question as having "a stronger meaning" than "a simple message." He further explained that the film simply contains his "words to the next generation", so the viewer should decide whether to take the words as advice or as a warning.  " ", Midnight Eye 

===Music===
 
The film score of Battle Royale was composed, arranged and conducted by Masamichi Amano, performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and features several pieces of Western classical music along with Amanos original compositions. The choral movement used in the films overture and original trailer is the "Dies Irae" from Giuseppe Verdi’s Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem.

The song used during the end credits, "Shizuka na Hibi no Kaidan o" by the rap rock band Dragon Ash, is not included in either the Japanese or French edition of the soundtrack. 

==Theatrical release==

===Controversies===
Fukasaku originally opposed the R15 rating given by the Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai (Eirin) because of Fukasakus experiences as a teenager, the novels use of 15-year-olds, and the fact that many of the actors were around fifteen years of age. After he submitted an appeal and before Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai could rule on the appeal, members of the Diet of Japan said that the film harmed teenagers; the Diet members also criticised the film industry ratings, which were a part of self-regulation by the Japanese film industry. Fukasaku dropped the appeal to appease the Japanese Diet in hopes they would not pursue increasing film regulation further.

 art house MPAA ratings board, and the major theater chains will never play it un-rated. If you cut it enough to get an R rating thered be nothing left." 

In April 2013, the District Court (Amtsgericht) in Fulda, Germany, decided after some turns in the legal system that Battle Royale violates §131 of the Criminal Code, making it guilty of glorification of violence.  The film is now confiscated and banned in Germany.

===Release===
Battle Royale was released on December 16, 2000, in Japan, grossing Japanese yen|¥3.11 billion domestically (over $25 million U.S. dollar|US).   Over the next two years, the film was distributed to cinemas throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America (in addition to Mexico), gaining early cult film followings in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and the Philippines. 

The first showing in the US was at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California, in 2002. 

The original 113-minute version of the film began its first North American theatrical run at the Cinefamily Theater in Los Angeles on December 24, 2011 – 11 years after its original Japanese release.    The planned 9-day run was extended another 6 days due to popular demand.  Beginning in early 2012, the film has been publicly exhibited at screenings in many American universities, including those in Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Texas and Massachusetts, with a New York City run at the IFC Center that began on May 25, 2012. As of June 2012, it has been regularly showing at the Projection Booth Theatre, site of the former Gerrard Cinema in Toronto, Canada.    The Cleveland Cinematheque also held a screening of the film on April 3, 2012. 

===Special edition===
A special edition of the film was released after the original which has eight extra minutes of running time. Unusually, the extra material includes scenes newly filmed after the release of the original. Inserted scenes include (but are not limited to):
* Flashbacks to a basketball game which is used as a framework for the entire story.
* A flashback that expands on a likely contributor to Mitsuko Soumas mental illness or sociopathy. She comes home from school to find her mother drunk with a strange man, who tries to molest her. She then pushes him down the staircase to his death.
* Three epilogues (referred to as "requiems"). The first is an extension of the basketball scene, showing the students of Class 3-B winning their game. It also spotlights Mitsukos apparent social anxiety and alienation from the classmates in 3-B. The second is a vision of Nobu telling Shuya to take care of Noriko (a replay of a hallucination seen earlier in the special version of the film). The third is a scene between Kitano and Noriko, who talk casually by a riverbank; parts of this scene (a dream sequence) also appear in the original version of the film, but with the dialogue muted whereas in the requiem it is audible and reveals a friendship or other relationship may or may not have existed between Noriko and Kitano.
* Added shots of the lighthouse after the shoot-out.
* Added reaction shots in the classroom, and extensions to existing shots.
* Extra CGI throughout the film.

===Critical reception=== A Clockwork horror is uneasy, but this isnt a film youll forget easily. And, seriously, what would you do?"  
 teen movie."  In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as the best film he had seen in the past two decades, stating that, "If there’s any movie that’s been made since I’ve been making movies that I wish I had made, it’s that one." 
 The Hunger The Suffolk Voice gave it five out of five stars, stating that "the influence of “Royale” on works as disparate as “Kill Bill” and “The Hunger Games” cannot be measured" and describing Battle Royale as "Provocative, funny, violent, and aided by a script that somehow gives equal attention to most of the students while also displaying the well-thought out minutia behind the narrative."   
 black humor tense action that the film never quite feels bleak or depressing (though it does come close) – but most importantly it makes you think."  Devon Ashby of CraveOnline gave the film a score of 8.5 out of 10, referring to it as "Japanese legend Kinji Fukasaku’s adolescent shooting spree opus" and "a compassionate and technically accomplished masterpiece."  Brent McKnight of PopMatters gave the film a score of 9 out of 10, describing it as "savage, sharp, satirical, and brutally funny" and "a bleak commentary on humanity and society." 

===Allegorical and metaphoric interpretations=== maximalist satire of modern education systems and students transitions into competitive and exploitative employment markets, if not simply the trials and tribulations of youth,  others  have found the story more subtly symbolic of the various longer-term consequences in maintaining nationalistic, insular, and zero-sum diplomatic and socio-political policies, particularly pertaining to Japanese imperialism, censorship, and militarism in the mid-20th century. 

===Accolades=== Picture of the Year and won three of them.  The film also received multiple awards from international film festivals.

 backlash against PG or the novel, the original film, and the manga. The reporter noted "the hubbub...was at least slightly premature   New Line hasnt yet purchased the remake rights." 

Following the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007, Lee claimed that prospects for the remake had been "seriously shaken". While he remained willing to proceed, he stated, "we might be a little more sensitive to some of the issues." The reporting article noted that New Line still had not secured remake rights – its spokeswoman claimed "no news" when asked about progress on any deal. 
 2012 film adaptation, has been criticised for its similarities to the 1999 novel Battle Royale.  Although its author Suzanne Collins maintains that she "had never heard of that book until   book was turned in", The New York Times reports that "the parallels are striking enough that Collins’s work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff", but argues that "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently."  The 2012 film adaptation has also faced similar criticisms for similarities to Battle Royale.    

In March 2012, Roy Lee reported that a remake of Battle Royale would no longer be possible due to the release of The Hunger Games, stating that "Audiences would see it as just a copy of Games – most of them wouldnt know that ‘Battle Royale’ came first. Its unfair, but thats reality." However, he stated that he might return to the film in ten years to "develop a ‘Battle Royale movie for the next generation."   

===American TV series===
During the summer of 2012, The CW Television Network had been in discussion with the Hollywood representatives about the possibility of turning Battle Royale into an American television show. According to a spokesperson, the talks were only preliminary, but if a deal could be reached, the network would acquire rights to Koushun Takamis underlying novel, then unpack and expand on it for an hour-long dramatic series. Joyce Jun, a Hollywood attorney representing U.S. rights to the title, states that "there is no deal in place". A CW spokesman confirmed only there had been some discussion but declined to comment further.
