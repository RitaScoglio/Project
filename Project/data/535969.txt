Paulie is a 1998 film about a disobedient bird named Paulie, starring Tony Shalhoub, Gena Rowlands, Hallie Eisenberg, and Jay Mohr. Mohr performs the voice of Paulie and plays a minor on-screen character.

==Plot== picaresque tale about an intelligent talking Blue-crowned Parakeet|blue-crowned conure named Paulie and his long quest to return to his owner.
 immigrant and former teacher of literature, is living in America and working as a janitor at an animal testing lab. There he encounters Paulie and is shocked to see him talk in English, and that too perfectly. However, Paulie does not speak a word when Misha brings others to witness a talking bird.

Misha woos Paulie to tell his story by offering him pieces of mango as he had found out about conures eating habits. He tells Misha about his master, a little girl named Marie (Hallie Eisenberg) who was a stutterer. The story goes into flashback. He is a baby bird. As Marie learns to speak, so does he, and he learns well, understanding the meaning of words and learning to construct complex sentences. Soon Maries father, Warren (Matt Craven), whos a soldier, returns home from Vietnam. However, he does not like Paulie and believes hes not helping her to speak. Its believed he resented Paulie for his closeness to her instead of him and that he was able to help her speak when none of his methods worked.

It becomes very obvious that he wants Marie to forget Paulie when he brings her a cat. Its also obvious that the cat and Paulie dont get along either, mainly because hes afraid of it. It tries a few times to attack him. However, again Warren blames him for Maries speaking problems and believes shes in a fantasy about him speaking. Eventually after a dramatic event in which she falls off the roof in an attempt to teach him to fly, he convinces her mother, Lila (Laura Harrington), to send him away.

Paulie is passed from one owner to another, eventually ending up in a pawn shop, where he spends his time insulting the customers, until he is purchased by a widowed artist named Ivy (Gena Rowlands). She befriends him and agrees to take him to find Marie, who has moved across the country to Los Angeles. Ivy loses her sight and Paulie decides to stay and take care of her, but this is cut short when she dies one day and is taken away while he, having finally learned to fly, continues his journey.

In East Los Angeles, Paulie joins a group of performing conures owned by Ignacio (Cheech Marin), but is kidnapped by Benny (Jay Mohr) and begins a life of crime. In a botched jewel theft, Paulie flies down through the chimney of a house, but is trapped inside and abandoned.

Paulie is then brought to the institute, his current home, where employees and scientists are stunned by his intelligence. They put him through tests and promise that he will be reunited with Marie. When he discovers that they lied to him, he refuses to cooperate with any more tests. His wings are clipped, and he is imprisoned in the basement.

Moved by Paulies story, Misha decides to give up his menial job to release Paulie and take him to Marie. After escaping from the institute and taking a bus to her address, they find her, now full grown and a beautiful young woman (Trini Alvarado) and unrecognizable to him. After a moment of confusion, they are happily reunited when she sings his favorite song and he remembers her, flying with joy. The film ends with her and Misha going into her house with Paulie to catch up.
