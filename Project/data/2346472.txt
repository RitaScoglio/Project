 Christian end times film produced by Russell S. Doughten.  It is the first and best known film in Doughtens four-part series on the Rapture and Second Coming of Christ.  The films together are often referred to collectively as the "Thief" or "Rapture" series.

==Plot== mark identifying them with UNITE will be arrested. Patty desperately tries to avoid the law and the mark but is captured by UNITE.  Patty escapes but is cornered by UNITE on a bridge, and falls from the bridge to her death.

Patty then awakens, this time for real, and realizes that all she had experienced was only a dream.  Her relief is short-lived when the radio announces that millions of people have disappeared. Horrified, Patty frantically searches for her family only to find them missing too. Traumatized and distraught, Patty realizes that the Rapture has indeed occurred and shes been left behind.

==Music==
This film includes Larry Normans composition I Wish Wed All Been Ready, one of the earliest Christian rock hits and one of Normans best-known releases.

==Legacy== Christian film, rock music and elements of horror films to a genre then dominated by family-friendly evangelism.   A quarter century later, the authors of the broadly successful Left Behind series of books and films have acknowledged their debt to Thief.   Indeed, even the title "Left Behind" echoes the refrain of Normans theme music for A Thief in the Night.
