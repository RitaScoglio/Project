==Plot== Jack Jones) apartment in Los Angeles in order to remove some of its more valuable items. It soon becomes apparent that while Nick (a successful singer) isnt at home, someone is clearly there. The anonymous person watches Gail take a phone call from a reporter asking about the couples divorce and inquiring as to when Nick will release his next album, as hes been on a six year hiatus since marrying Gail. As the phone call ends and Gail walks around the house she is ambushed and murdered by the person, who is wearing an old lady mask and womens clothing.
 David Doyle). Bill Owen). Soon after his arrival Nick begins to experience strange phenomena that include visions of his ex-wife Gail. Nick is unaware of Gails death, so hes confused by her appearance at the manor. Despite this, Nick begins to work on his album and further develop his romance with Linda. His psychological state is not helped when his associate Harry (Peter Turner) goes missing and Nick discovers that Linda was formerly dating Webster. One night Nick decides to investigate some of the strange noises hes seen and ends up finding Gails severed, decomposing head. This puts Nick into a catatonic state and he is temporarily admitted to a hospital because of this.

Nick and Linda eventually consummate their new relationship, only for Linda to disappear the following day. This nearly devastates Nick and hes instructed by his physician to take things slowly and to re-visit his apartment, as the physician believes that all of the unexplained phenomena have been a result of Nicks distress over the divorce and the stress of recording his album. Once at the apartment Nick notices that the apartment has been thoroughly cleaned with antiseptic and the carpeting replaced, which marks him as strange since he left the apartment clean upon his departure and gave no orders to have anything replaced. He returns to the English manor and discusses this with Mrs. B, who tells him not to worry about any of this.

However soon after Nick is attacked by the masked old woman. He flees and runs into Mrs. B, who reveals that the masked old woman is Mr. B and that they have killed Gail and Harry out of insanity and revenge. Theyre angry with Nick, as their only daughter had been obsessed with him and had committed suicide after he announced that hed married Gail. The murders and supposedly supernatural occurrences were to be their way of getting even with him for everything and that their final act would be to kill Nick himself after slowly driving him insane. Mr. B then tries to kill Nick again, only for Nick to duck and for Mrs. B to accidentally take the fatal wound, which stops Mr. B from further attacking in favor of cradling his dead wifes body. Webster then arrives and upon seeing what happened, calls the police. Just before they arrive, Nick hears tapping in the walls and manages to locate Linda, who the Bs had entombed in the walls with the body of their dead daughter. The two go outside and as the police cart away Mr. B, Nick sees the ghost of Gail waving at him from one of the manors windows, showing that some of the phenomena hed experienced had been at least partially real.

==Critical reception== Time Out panned the film, writing "Not even its brace of transvestite red herrings can help the story stand on its own feet."   DVD Verdict and Twitch Film both gave mixed reviews for the film,  and DVD Verdict wrote that "Its by no means a terrible film, just a soft one. There are too few jolts and too few kills. On top of that, the reveal is so out-of-left-field, it feels like a cheat."  In contrast, HorrorNews.net and Steve Chibnall both praised the film,  with Chibnall writing in the book British Horror Cinema that "The Comeback contains Walkers most accomplished exercises in suspense, but the films tongue is more firmly in its cheek than ever before."
