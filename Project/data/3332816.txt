==Reception==
The film was a commercial hit and received mixed reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised the performance of the lead cast saying, "Kasoor scores the most in that one important department - performances. Credit for this must go primarily to the two principal performers - Aftab Shivdasani and Lisa Ray - who come up with proficient performances."  Aparajita Saha of Rediff stated, "this is a film that attempted an intriguing premise but failed when it didnt fully explore that very premise and take it to its logical and rightful conclusion."
