}} thriller film directed by Bruce Beresford and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Ashley Judd, and Bruce Greenwood. The film is about a woman who is framed for the murder of her husband.

==Plot== love making, Libby falls asleep. She wakes to find her husband missing and blood all over her hands, clothes, legs, and the boats floors. A Coast Guard vessel appears and Libby is spotted holding a bloody knife she found lying on the deck. She is arrested, humiliated in the media, tried, and convicted of her husbands murder.

Libby asks her best friend, Angela Green (Annabeth Gish), to look after her 4-year-old son, Matty (Benjamin Weir), for the duration of her prison sentence. On a phone call with Matty from prison, Libby hears a door open in the background, then Matty exclaims, "Daddy!" right before the line goes dead.
 Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution.

Libby is paroled after six years and begins searching for Nick and Matty, while living in a halfway house under the supervision of parole officer Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones). Libby violates her curfew and is caught breaking into Mattys school on Whidbey Island to try to get Angelas records, but manages to escape from Lehman and continue her search.

After discovering Angela has recently died in Colorado, Libby recognizes a Kandinsky painting in a newspaper photo. Tracing it through a dealers database (which nearly again allows her capture by Lehman) leads her to New Orleans, where she finds Nick living a luxurious lifestyle under an assumed name, Jonathan Devereaux.

Libby confronts him after making a winning bid of $10,000 on him at a bachelors auction. She demands he return Matty in exchange for her silence about his real identity. Nick agrees to bring Matty to a meeting in a cemetery. There, while a band at a funeral plays the St. James Infirmary Blues in the background, he uses a decoy boy to distract Libby, knocks her unconscious, and locks her in a casket inside a mausoleum. Using a .38 caliber handgun she had snatched from Lehman, Libby manages to shoot the hinges off the lid of the casket and escape the mausoleum by throwing a flower vase through a stained glass window.
 DMV records to prove his suspicions, and later confirms them when he uncovers six DMV records under that name, including Nicks DMV application and photograph. After seemingly capturing Libby later in the city, the two actually team up. Lehman visits Nick in his office under the pretense of asking for money to keep his identity secret. He records a remark by Nick that he had murdered his wife, the only witness to his true past. Libby enters, holding Nick at gunpoint. Nick is given a choice of surrendering to the authorities or getting shot by his vengeful ex-wife, whom he believes would go free for this deed because of double jeopardy.

Nick responds with violence. In the ensuing melee, Nick pulls out a hidden gun, shoots Lehman, and fires away at Libby. Lehman manages to bring Nick down before Nick can shoot Libby. Nick gets the upper hand, but before he can kill the wounded parole officer, Libby shoots him dead.

Lehman promises to help Libby get fully pardoned. Together, they travel to Mattys boarding school in Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia, where he is playing soccer. Matty (Spencer Treat Clark), now eleven years old, recognizes his mother and they embrace with Travis watching them.

==Production==
Jodie Foster was originally attached to star in the film as Libby Parsons after Michelle Pfeiffer, Meg Ryan and Brooke Shields all declined the role, and Bruce Beresford met with her several times about the script:
 "She said to me once, when we were having . . .not an argument, we had different points of view over something, and she said, Well have to do it my way, Im afraid. And I said, Why, Jodie? And she said, Because Im so intelligent. Im such an intelligent person that there is no point in disagreeing with me because Im always right. I thought she was joking, but she wasnt!   She had this extraordinary opinion of her own IQ."  
However, Foster then became pregnant so Ashley Judd stepped in. Greg Kinnear was offered the part of Nick Parsons, but he passed and Bruce Greenwood eventually took over. According to Beresford, Robert Benton did an uncredited ten day rewrite shortly before production began.

==Legal accuracy== Fifth Amendment.  "There are two separate incidents," Dershowitz claims. "She was falsely accused the first time. And maybe she can sue for that or get some credit. But then she committed an entirely separate or at least planned to commit an entirely separate crime the second time. And theres just no defense of double jeopardy for doing it the second time."

More drastically, as the Clause was interpreted by the Supreme Court in Heath v. Alabama (1985), a conviction in Georgia state court would not bar a prosecution in federal or Louisiana state court, even for an identical offense.
