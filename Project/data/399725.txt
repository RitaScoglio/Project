Orgazmo is a 1997 American comedy film written & directed by Trey Parker, and produced by Matt Stone. The two later went on to create the animated series South Park.

==Plot==
Mormon missionary Joseph Young, assigned with his mission partner to Los Angeles, finds the city to be an unfriendly and unreceptive place for their work. Things come to a head when they knock on the door of sleazy porn director Maxx Orbison and several security guards are sent to deal with them. Joe dispatches all of them singlehandedly with a variety of unexpected martial arts skills. Baffled by his performance and fed up with his current project’s lead actor being a wimp, Orbison attempts to hire Joe to be the titular lead of his pornographic superhero film, Orgazmo. Joe is conflicted because of his beliefs but the salary offered would pay for a wedding in the temple in Utah where his fiancée Lisa has expressed a strong desire to wed. Joe caves in despite being given a sign from God.

Joe finds the crew of the film off-putting but manages to befriend co-star Ben Chapleski, a technical genius and graduate from M.I.T. who works in the pornographic industry to satiate his overactive sex drive. He plays Orgazmo’s sidekick Choda Boy, who assists Orgazmo with specially designed sex toys, including Orgazmo’s signature weapon, the Orgazmorator, a ray gun that forces orgasm upon whomever it is fired. Ben invites Joe to his home later on and shows Joe a real, working Orgazmorator Ben has built and he and Joe spend an evening using it on unsuspecting citizens for amusement.

At a sushi bar owned by Ben’s Japanese friend G-Fresh, the two witness a group of thugs vandalizing the bar in an attempt to force out G-Fresh so their dance club next door can expand. Later on, when Ben and Joe are not present, G-Fresh is coerced to leave. Upon finding this out, Joe and Ben don costumes and utilize their movie props and the Orgazmorator to sneak into the club and steal back the contract G-Fresh was forced to sign. Joe is shaken after nearly being shot in the head but Ben is exhilarated by finally getting to be a real superhero.

Orgazmo becomes an amazing success, both financially and critically, and Orbison withholds Joe’s paycheck to keep him in town long enough to announce a sequel, and he wishes for Joe to reprise his role. Tempted with a doubled salary, Joe is confronted by his fiancée who has found out what he has been doing and leaves him. Facing production difficulties and harassment from Orbison’s obnoxious nephew A-Cup, Joe tries to back out of the project but Orbison won’t hear of it and, when Joe stands up to him, Orbison has Lisa kidnapped to force Joe into compliance. When Ben finds out the thugs who roughed up G-Fresh are also working for Orbison, he joins Joe in storming Orbison’s mansion before Lisa can be forced to perform in one of Orbison’s films.

Fighting through Orbison’s group of henchmen ranging from other male pornographic actors to boom microphone operators, Joe and Ben meet their match in A-Cup. Joe helps Ben overcome a mental block from childhood that forced him to repress the Hamster Style discipline of martial arts, allowing Ben to defeat A-Cup. After repairing his damaged Orgazmorator, Joe manages to repeatedly shoot Orbison with it, incapacitating him and capturing all the henchmen. Ben blows up the mansion with another device, the ‘Cock Rocket’, destroying Orbison’s base of operations. Joe and Lisa reconcile and she gives him her blessing to remain in Los Angeles and continue being a hero alongside Ben.

As the film ends, Orbison is seen in a doctor’s office being told that after so many orgasms in a row, his testicles have swollen to the size of oranges and that a surgical removal is the only option. Orbison laughs insanely, declaring revenge on Orgazmo as he will now be the personification of A-Cups character and Orgazmos nemesis who is immune to the Orgazmorator: Neutered Man.
