==Plot==
The film opens with the 27-year-old protagonist, young mathematician Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) talking to her father Robert (Anthony Hopkins) after he startles her watching TV in the middle of the night. He gives her a bottle of champagne for her birthday, and they chat for a while about the nature of insanity, ending with the revelation that Robert died last week and his funeral is tomorrow.

Awakened from this dream, Catherine realizes that Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a former graduate student of Roberts, is still upstairs, reading through Roberts books. Hal believes that somewhere in the gibberish there might be additional products of his mathematical genius. On his way out, he comments on the vast amount of work Robert did. Catherine, suspicious, searches his backpack but finds nothing, but when she picks up Hals coat to give to him, a notebook falls out. He explains that he wanted to give the notebook as a birthday present because it "had something written in it about her, not math, her". Hal is forced to leave, giving the notebook as intended, when Catherine calls the police.
 New Yorker. Relations between the sisters are tense, and Catherine cannot stand her sisters constant harping on matters of appearance. Catherine is also upset that Claire didnt care for her father as much as Catherine did in his final years. A series of flashbacks documents Catherines ultimately futile struggle to keep up with her own studies as she takes care of her father.

At the funeral, Catherine expresses her frustration with the many people there. She interrupts the string quartet with an impromptu speech, berating everyone for not being there for her father while he was alive. She ends by saying shes glad her father is dead and walks out of the church mid-funeral.
 wake at the house the night after the funeral, and Catherine and Hal end up sleeping together afterwards.
 consummate their hers and not her fathers despite evidence to the contrary, and neither Hal nor Claire believe her. Hal decides to take it to the math department the next day to verify the proofs accuracy.

He returns as Claire and Catherine are leaving, with news that the math department believes the proof to be valid. Hal tells Claire that he doesnt think that her father wrote the proof because it employs newer mathematics and wants Catherine to explain it to him sometime. Catherine remains stung by his earlier lack of trust, and the sisters leave for the airport; but, Hal sprints after the car and throws the book through the window and onto Catherines lap.

At the airport, Catherine has another flashback. It is revealed that, while living together, her father challenged her to work on math, which she does, and she did in fact write the ground-breaking proof. She goes to tell her father about the breakthrough, but he insists she read aloud his own, nonsensical "proof". Realizing that Robert has slipped back into illness and wouldnt understand her work, she locks her notebook into his desk drawer and keeps the key (which she presented to Hal earlier in the film).

Catherine has begun to come to terms with herself, aided by Hals confidence in her. She decides that she does not need to go with her sister to New York and runs out of the airport. She returns to University of Chicago, and the film ends with her and Hal meeting up on campus and discussing the proof.

===Awards and nominations===
Gwyneth Paltrow received Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress â€“ Motion Picture Drama for Proof, but lost to Felicity Huffman.

Ghent International Film Festival Awards, Georges Delerue Prize
* Won: Proof Stephen Warbeck (2005) 

===Mathematical relevance=== A Beautiful Mind (2001), Proof (2005) and The Imitation Game (2014). 

The mathematician Daniel Ullman says: "Of these three films, Proof is the one that most realistically illustrates the world of mathematics and mathematicians."  Timothy Gowers of the University of Cambridge, a Fields Medalist, and Paul Sally of the University of Chicago, acted as mathematical consultants,   but Ullman praises the director too: "Madden should be credited with capturing the feeling of the mathematical world."
