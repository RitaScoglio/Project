==Plot== the first film and a giant blade that falls from the ceiling of a hospital corridor. She is eventually killed by a miniature rotating machine that shoots her in the stomach. Her body is taken outside and dumped into a pit. The pit is then shown to be filled with hundreds of Alice clones. The camera zooms out to show a shack camouflaging the facilitys above-ground entrance - with the rest of the facility located underground, surrounded by a high fence and thousands of zombies.

Despite the best efforts of Umbrella to cover up the  , the T-Virus has spread around the world. As the virus spread, it affected not only humans, but other plants and animals as well, and the Earths environment rapidly deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. Alice wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. She comes across hearing a group asking for help on the radio, broadcasting from station KLKB, where they have taken refuge. It turns out that they are a group of bandits, robbing the survivors who show up to help them. One of the men slaps Alice and attempts to rape her but she kicks him on the chin as he spews blood from the mouth and dies. They knock Alice unconscious and put her in a basement to fight with several infected dogs, but she overpowers them, and lets them loose on their owners and kills them.

Meanwhile, Dr. Sam Isaacs, former head of the Project Alice and the current manager of the North American Umbrella facility, operated in the vast landscape of Nevada, considers Alices recapture a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the world-wide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason OMara) orders Isaacs to instead use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alices recapture until they are informed of her location.
 Carlos Oliveira Christopher Egan), Ashanti Douglas), along with others, travel cross country.
 Las Vegas to search for supplies for their trip to Alaska.

Dr. Isaacs attempts to domesticate the infected have led to a new zombie breed that remembers basic things, such as how to use phones and cameras. Weskers security officer, Captain Alexander Slater (Matthew Marsden), is adamant about Isaacs disregarding Umbrellas regulations. Slater does admit that the, "super zombies" (the Crimson Head) would be useful, but reiterates that Isaacs is out of control. Wesker, in private, informs Slater to keep watch about Isaacs actions, and that if he disobeys his direct order, Slater will terminate Isaacs employment.

Umbrella triangulates Alices location based on her psionic abilities. Dr. Isaacs has a crate of his new zombies sent to ambush the convoy, against Weskers specific orders. L.J. succumbs to his infection and bites Carlos. Most of the convoy, including Chase and Mikey, are killed in the ambush. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from their programming and continues to fight. She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he becomes infected as he tries to flee. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs computer to track the helicopters flight path, leading to Umbrellas underground location.

The convoy goes to the site, which is surrounded by zombies. Carlos sacrifices himself by ploughing his truck into the zombie mob and blowing them all up, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. Ordered by Wesker to terminate Isaacs, Slater arrives with a group of commandos, and finds the scientist locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection, explaining that the zombies are enhanced and as such, he requires a bigger dosage of the anti-virus; he disobeys Slaters command to stop, since it will only increase his mutation. Isaacs refuses, and Slater reveals that his employment is terminated and shoots him, triggering his mutation into a Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant. Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater, kills all the facility employees, but is confined to the labs lower levels.

Entering the facility, Alice meets a holograph of the Red Queens sister Artificial intelligence|AI, the White Queen (Madeline Carroll). The White Queen informs Alice that her blood is the cure to the T-Virus, defending the Red Queens actions as well. She then tells Alice about Dr. Isaacs. Alice agrees to deal with him. On her way to the labs lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but seems to die from shock upon seeing Alice. Alice finds a replica of the mansion she lived in and finds Isaacs, who fights her with equal strength and psionics. Finding themselves in a replica of the Hives laser corridor, Alice awaits the grids arrival, watching Isaacs getting sliced into cubes. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, which has inexplicably revived.

Later, in Tokyo, Japan, Wesker, who is the head of the Tokyo Umbrella facility, informs the rest of the Umbrella chairmen, all holograms, that the North American facility has been lost. Alices hologram makes an appearance, declaring that she is coming for him, and shes bringing some of her, "friends." Standing beside her clone, Alice looks out onto the hundreds of pods containing her developing clones.

* The film would feature new "super zombies" that had been "pumped up on some sort of alter-essence steroids". The final "super zombies" are created using blood taken from clones of Alice.

Steven Hyden of The Onions The A.V. Club|A.V. Club said that "the movie delivers some simple-minded thrills" and praised the "solidly effective killer-ravens sequence" but felt the film was too predictable, saying: "Anybody who has ever seen a zombie movie can figure out what happens next. Somebody will get bit without telling the others, which will inevitably backfire. Survivors will be forced to shoot suddenly undead friends in the head. One of them dastardly science folk will protect the monsters in order to study them, which will also inevitably backfire. And legions of undead will be re-killed in surprisingly easy fashion." 

Kevin Crust of the The Los Angeles Times|Los Angeles Times praised the film, saying that "the story and characters are surprisingly engaging, with fight scenes and scares effectively placed between plot turns" although he felt that the ending was too "open-ended". 
Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave Extinction half a star out of a possible four, saying that the film was "no more interesting than watching someone else play with his PlayStation|Playstation".    New York Daily News gave the film a score of one and a half stars out of five, calling the action scenes "monotonous" and urging audiences to "flee this yawn of the dead." 
Helen OHara of  " and had "an effectively creepy empty world setting", she felt that it was "nevertheless scuppered by a lack of coherence." 
 Day of the Dead,   is no less derivative than its predecessors but moves along at a brisk clip."  Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat gave Extinction a score of three out of five, saying that the film had "rather lazy pacing" but added that "the way Anderson keeps upping the ante with regard to Alices ultimate fate continues to amuse." 
 Golden Trailer Award for Best Action Poster and was nominated for Best TV Spot.
