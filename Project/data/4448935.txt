With Fog Mother sensing Koujis presence, Agito attempts to finish the job in his true form, only to be killed by J. Then Kouji enters the Fog Mothers domain and faces Zu as she assumes her true form. J manages to kill Zu as they both crash into the fortress which is Fog Mother. After Zu dies, Kouji learns of Fogs intention of letting her new brood devour humanity, as Garai completes the ritual and sends Kana to the hatching chamber while manhandling Kouji. Berry intervenes to free Kana from Fogs spell before being struck down by Garai, as Kana is sent down to her death, while Fog Mother begins attacking a nearby city to prepare for her childrens awakening.
