 sorcery for their own gain. The film was released on May 3, 1996, by Columbia Pictures.

== Plot ==
Sarah Bailey ( ). Sarah also meets and becomes attracted to the football captain Chris Hooker (Skeet Ulrich). 

Bonnies attention is called to Sarah in their French class, when she witnesses Sarah telekinetically rotating a pencil. It is later revealed that Sarah has attempted suicide in the past because of difficulty in controlling her powers. Nancy, Bonnie, and Rochelle decide that Sarah will complete their coven as the fourth member; therefore enhancing all of their powers.

After school that day, the three girls find Sarah watching Chris football practice from beside the field, and introduce themselves.  Nancy warns her against sexual involvement with Chris: “He spreads disease. I speak from personal experience.” They take a trip to the local occult shop owned by Lirio, a woman who seems to have psychic abilities and is well-versed in the practice of magic. Lirio informs Sarah that, unlike her friends, she is a “natural witch,” whose power comes from within. She later warns the girls that anything they put out into the world will return to them three-fold. 

Later that night, on the street, Sarah is harassed for the second time by a snake-bearing vagrant, who is quickly struck by a car. The other three girls excitedly exclaim that their collective powers were responsible for this event. The girls tell Sarah that they worship a powerful deity named Manon and as they explain to her the potential of their new-found powers, Sarah is afraid of the idea and abandons them temporarily and secretly goes on a date with Chris. 

The next day, Sarah is upset to find that Chris has spread a false rumor that the two had sex, seemingly in retaliation for her polite rejection of his proposition at the end of their date. In order to comfort Sarah, the three girls take her to a remote area in the forest to perform a ritual involving several spells: Sarah casts a love spell on Chris, Rochelle casts a revenge spell on Laura, Bonnie casts a spell for beauty, and Nancy for “all the power of Manon.” It soon becomes clear that the spells were successful--Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, the scars on Bonnie’s body miraculously heal, and Rochelles bully begins to lose her hair. Nancy goes further by causing her stepfather to have a fatal heart attack as he violently assaults her mother. Nancy and her mother then learn they will receive $175,000 from his insurance, and they move into a posh, high-rise apartment. During a get-together at Nancy’s new home, the girls learn and perform glamour magic.

Nancy, desirous of still more power, encourages the others to join her in a rite called "Invoking the Spirit," in which she asks Manon to further increase her magical ability. At the climax of the ritual, she is struck by lightning. Afterwards, her risk-taking behavior begins to increase as her empathy recedes. The other girls begin to discover the negative consequences of their respective spells: Bonnie becomes conceited and narcissistic, Rochelle feels remorse when she finds Laura traumatized and sobbing over her baldness, and Chris attempts to rape Sarah.

Nancy retaliates against Chris by casting a glamour spell to disguise herself as Sarah in order to seduce him at a party, but they are quickly interrupted by Sarah, and Nancy, in a fit of rage, uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window. Horrified and saddened over his death, Sarah performs a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but due to her extreme power Nancy is able to block out the spell and the coven turns on Sarah.

With no one else to turn to, Sarah goes to Lirios shop, and Lirio tells Sarah that she had inherited her powers from her deceased mother who was also a witch, and she encourages Sarah to invoke the Spirit herself. Nancy, Bonnie, and Rochelle create the illusion of an explosion overtaking the shop, and Sarah runs to her home in panic. The girls, waiting for her there, torment her with visions of rats, insects, and snakes filling the house. They try to persuade her to commit suicide, and Nancy slashes her wrists. Sarah eventually casts a spell to scare off Bonnie and Rochelle, and with encouragement from the spirit of her mother, Sarah invokes Manon and is able to heal and defend herself. She successfully casts a binding spell on Nancy.

Bonnie and Rochelle turn up at Sarah’s house one day and ask her if she still has powers or if she wants to hang out with them again. Sarah obviously doesnt want anything to do with them anymore and the two girls walk away and mock her. Sarah causes lightning to strike a tree, and a falling branch nearly crushes the two girls. She warns them, “Be careful. You don’t want to end up like Nancy.” The scene shifts to a psychiatric hospital, where Nancy has been confined, and as she screams and rambles in believing she still has powers, she is given a sedative by a nurse. As the film closes, her final words are "Im flying."
