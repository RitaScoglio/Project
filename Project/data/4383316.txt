Hurricane Smith is a 1992 film directed by Colin Budds and starring Carl Weathers.

Hurricane Smith is an action movie that follows an oil field worker named Billy Hurricane Smith (played by Carl Weathers) as he gets mixed up with drug smugglers on his quest to rescue his sister.

==Plot==
Billy "Hurricane" Smith (Carl Weathers) is a construction worker in Marshall, Texas. Mourning his mothers death, Billy goes to Australia to find his missing sister. His search takes him to the swank pad of a pimp, Shanks (David Argue), and one of his hookers, Julie (Cassandra Delaney), who both knew Billys sister.

Billy is tortured by his sisters former employer, crime boss Charlie Dowd (Jürgen Prochnow), who is secretly waging a turf war against his partner Howard Fenton (Tony Bonner), and Billy is not about to blow town without finding his sister—and then Billy discovers that his sister was murdered by Charlie.

Not only does Shanks endure a savage beating to help Billy, but Shanks is also killed when they storm Charlies mansion in search of the now-kidnapped Julie. Ever busy Charlie has already blown up Howard in an explosion which almost killed Billy, and has murdered his own girlfriend just to eliminate loose ends.

With the SWAT team called in, Charlie uses Julie as a shield after his men are wiped out. Charlie commandeers a chopper. Climbing onto the bottom of the chopper, which flies over a part of the ocean, Billy throws Charlie into the water below, where Charlie is killed by a swarm of sharks.

Billy is now free to make plans to bring Julie stateside, where they will not run into any of her former customers.

==Production==
The film was shot in May 1990.

==Box office==
Hurricane Smith grossed $89,467 at the box office in Australia.
