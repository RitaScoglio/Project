 spy novel Andrew Davies. It was shot at the Ardmore Studios in County Wicklow, Ireland, and on location in Panama City, Lake Gatun, and Gamboa, Panama. The film was produced by Boormans Irish production company Merlin Films, with financial support from Columbia Pictures.

The movie, like the book, is inspired in part by Our Man in Havana. The film is set in the present day, unlike the book, which was based in the 1980s, prior to the U.S. withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone.

== Plot ==
Andy Osnard is an MI6 spy reassigned to Panama after having an affair in Madrid with the foreign minister’s mistress. His superior warns him of the corruption present in Panama, but Osnard views that as an opportunity. Consulting a list of British citizens residing in Panama, he comes across Harry Pendel, who is the tailor to many of Panamas elite, including the President. Pendel, who has kept his criminal background hidden, is married to Louisa, who is the assistant to the administrator of the Panama Canal Authority. While Harry is a superb tailor he is a bad businessman; his tailor shop is constantly in debt.

Knowing that Pendel needs money, Osnard offers to help him, if Pendel feeds him information about the elite of Panama City. Pendel agrees. However, Osnard tells Pendel he needs better information to keep the arrangement going, and now he can also threaten to reveal that Pendel has been spying.

Pendel starts "tailoring" his stories, making them fit better, escalating the roles of friends to make them appear more significant than they are. He casts his friend Mickie, a local drunk, as a revolutionary who still holds sway over the youth of Panama. He also casts his shop manager as the leader of an opposition movement. After fixing the suit of the President of Panama (whose conversation consisted of his suit being too tight), he comes up with a tale that the president intends to sell the canal to China. When an incredulous Osnard asks which, Beijing or Taiwan, Pendel replies "both." Osnard knows that Pendel is making up these stories, but does not care if it is true, as long as it is believable to his superiors.

As he passes along this misinformation  (bypassing the embassy staff, apart from Francesca, a staffer he has an affair with), it makes its way to Washington, where officials are alarmed and plan an invasion to prevent the canal from falling into Chinese hands. Pendel, meanwhile, seeks to end his spying, saying the opposition wont listen to him because it needs funds. Osnard asks how much, and Pendel names a figure he thinks is high enough to put off Osnard:  Osnard smiles, then relays a request to fund the opposition as a means to control Panama after this supposed revolution. He asks for fifteen million. At the Pentagon the request is made for twenty million, which then gets pushed back down to fifteen. Osnards superior arrives with a briefcase containing the money, ready to meet with the opposition, while attack helicopters are preparing for an assault on the city.

The British Ambassador uncovers what Osnard has been up to, and threatens to reveal everything. Osnard offers to bribe him and they haggle over the price, settling on 1.25 million for his silence and cooperation. Osnard manages to ditch his superior and make off with the briefcase.

Louisa, who never approved of Osnard, finds out what Pendel has been doing. She races to the Administrators office, who contacts the president of Panama, who is able to contact the US government and have the invasion called off shortly after it began. During this confusion, Osnard makes it to the airport, where he meets the Ambassador and hands him his bribe. The Ambassador allows Osnard to make it to an airplane.

Pendel returns home to Louisa, where he tries to explain everything.
