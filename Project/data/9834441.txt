Severus Snape arrives at Malfoy Manor to inform Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters of Harrys impending departure from No. 4 Privet Drive. Voldemort commandeers Lucius Malfoys wand, as Voldemorts own wand cannot be used to kill Harry, because the wands are "twins".
 Order of the Phoenix gather at Privet Drive and escort Harry to safety, using Polyjuice Potion to create six decoy Harrys out of everyone else. During their flight to the Weasley family home at the Burrow, all are ambushed by Death Eaters, who kill Mad-Eye Moody and Harrys owl, Hedwig (Harry Potter)|Hedwig, injure George Weasley, and knock out Hagrid which forces Harry to take over and drive his flying motorcycle while fighting Voldemort, destroying some power lines that causes a blackout to the city. At the Burrow, Harry has a vision of the wand-maker Ollivander being tormented by Voldemort, who claims that Ollivander had lied to him by claiming that the only way Voldemort could kill Harry was by using another persons wand.

Scrimgeour arrives at the Burrow with Albus Dumbledores Will and distributes three items to Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Ron receives Dumbledores Deluminator, Hermione a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry the first Golden Snitch that he ever caught in a Quidditch match.

The locket around his neck attempts to strangle him, but Ron arrives to rescue Harry. Ron destroys the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor. Hermione is angry with Ron at first but then reconciles with him.

==Production==
 
  filming Dobby the house elf|Dobbys death scene in Pembrokeshire, Wales.]] director of photography Eduardo Serra, described Part 1 as "quite real"; a "road movie" thats "almost like a Cinéma vérité|vérité documentary".  
 Lionel Wigram. David Heyman, initially, responded negatively, but Wigram asked, “No, David. How are we going to do it?”. After rereading the book and discussing it with Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division. 

The production filmed at Dartford Crossing for the dramatic chase where Hagrid and Harry are being ambushed by Death Eaters. 

===Sets===
Stuart Craig, set designer for all of the previous Harry Potter films, returned for the final two parts. He said, "We made a very different kind of film, which was shot a great deal on location. We travelled quite far, we built sets, and they spend a lot of time in a forest," he explained. "We built forest sets and integrated them into the real forests, so there were challenges there, as you might imagine."  Craig was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Part 1. 

On the wedding tent for Bill and Fleurs wedding in Part 1, Craig commented on his aim to "rather than make it an extension of the house, which is rather eccentric, homemade, we decided to make it rather elegant . . . Its lined with silk and beautiful, floating candelabra. So its a nice contrast with the house." For the Ministry of Magic set, he noted, "This is an underground world; this is a ministry, so we went to the real ministries, the Muggle ministries – Whitehall, in London – and decided that our magical ministry was kind of a parallel universe to these real ministries."   

Craig also commented on his design of Malfoy Manor, saying that it is "a very strong architectural set. The exterior is based on an Elizabethan house here in this country called Hardwick Hall and it has massive windows, and these windows are kind of blinded out. The shutters are drawn so they are like blind windows and they have a real kind of presence, an ominous presence, so that gave us the basis for a good exterior. Theres an extraordinary magical roof thats added and surrounded by forest which isnt there in reality, but again is one of the devices to make it more threatening and mysterious." 

===Costumes=== Harry Potter Alexander McQueens Fall 2008 collection.  Temime spoke about the dress, saying that she "wanted it to be a witch wedding dress but not a Halloween dress. The dress is white but it needed to have something fantastic to it. So there is the phoenix  , the bird, which is a symbol of love in a way because there is rebirth, love never dies, it is born again." 

===Visual effects===
  Double Negative was asked to provide visual effects for the final instal ments of the story, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Parts&nbsp;1 and 2. Working closely with the films VFX&nbsp;Supervisor, Tim&nbsp;Burke, the team was led by VFX&nbsp;Supervisor, David Vickery and VFX&nbsp;Producer Charlotte Loughlane. The main team also included 3D&nbsp;Supervisor, Rick Leary and 2D&nbsp;Supervisor, Sean&nbsp;Stranks.

Double Negatives work for Part 1 included the corroding Warner Brothers logo and extensive environment extensions of the Burrows and its surrounds. Additional environment work was completed on Xenophilius Lovegoods home, extending it in 3D and culminating in the Death Eaters attack. Double Negative also advanced the Death Eaters smoke effects, with the introduction of the flayed man stage in between their smokey, fluid, flying state and their live-action presence upon landing. Other work included the Patronus charm that interrupts the wedding party to inform the guests that Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic. 

Also involved in the production was Framestore, the Academy Award|Oscar-winning visual effects company that produced the animated version of The Tale of the Three Brothers, directed by Ben Hibon alongside David Yates, as well as most of the creature CGI such as Dobby or Kreacher, as in previous films.
