==Plot==
 
 genetic altering, discovers the plan and sets one of his experiments on Judy, killing her. Lori arrives at EMAX, but when Judy does not appear, she breaks into the laboratory and films the various animals that are being experimented on. She discovers a Tibetan Mastiff named Max who does not appear to have been experimented on and lets the dog out of his cage. Dr. Jarret discovers that there is an intruder in the laboratory and chases Lori out of the building. Max follows Lori and jumps into her car as she drives away. Jarret immediately goes to the police and complains that his dog has been stolen. Later that day, when Lori goes shopping, a mugger (Thomas Rosales, Jr.) steals her purse. Max chases the thief, brutally kills him, and brings Loris purse back to her.

Unaware that the dog has killed a person, Lori decides to adopt Max. However, her boyfriend Perry (Fredric Lehne) refuses to allow the dog into their house. He finally agrees to let Max stay, but only if he stays in the backyard. Max can understand human conversations and becomes very protective of his new owner and perhaps more possessive than a normal pet, finds Lori and Perry having sex in their bedroom and tries to attack Perry; most likely understanding that Perry isnt too fond of Max.
 birds of prey giving him enhanced strength, speed, and senses. Max is also prone to violent rages, and Jarret regularly gives him a drug to keep him relaxed, but he fears that it wont be long before the effects of the drug wear off.
 mail man (Rick Barker). All of these incidents go unnoticed by Lori. Perry tries to kill Max by feeding him a poisoned hamburger, but Max smells the poison in the meat and chases Perry out of the house. After Perry escapes in his truck, Max eats Perrys pet parrot out of spite.
 junkyard and leaves him with the owner Ray (William Sanderson), who assures her that Max will be taken to a ranch in a few days. Instead, Ray chains Max to the wall and hits him over the head with a shovel, knocking him out. When Max wakes up, he pulls loose from his chain and attacks Ray, attempting to kill him. Ray arms himself with a blow torch and burns Maxs face, but is soon overpowered and killed. Max, now severely scarred, leaves the junkyard and makes his way back to Loris house. Though unknown to him, Perry was quick to replace Max with a puppy of his choice. 

So when Max sees Lori and Perry together and happy with their new puppy Spike, he feels completely betrayed and abandoned by his owner which causes him to go into a rage. He breaks in and confronts Perry, burning his face with acidic urine. Much to Loris shock, now that she sees the horrors that Max can do. After Perry is rushed to the hospital, the police have heard enough about Max to believe that he is a dangerous dog and arrive at the house to apprehend him, but Max manages to evade them and runs off.

In an attempt to get him back, Jarret kidnaps Lori in the hope that Max will follow. As Jarret drives back to the EMAX building, Max attacks, jumping onto the car and causing it to crash. Lori pulls herself free from the car and runs into the building with Max chasing her into the laboratory where she first discovered him. She grabs a knife to protect herself, but Max is still very angered and ready to turn on her. Lori realizes that despite all the bad things hes done, she cant bring herself to kill Max. Due to the factor that she knows hes a victim of what Jarret has made of him and that she still loves him. Its when Lori gives up that Max sees that his owner still loves him and finally calms down.

Suddenly, Jarret arrives with a pump-action shotgun and tries to shoot Lori, but Max protects her by taking the shot to the chest. Before he dies, Max pushes Jarret onto a large cage and a live wire resting on the cage ignites, electrocuting Jarret and killing him instantly. Lori finds Maxs dead body and mourns for him.

Three months later, Lori is going for a walk with her new dog and the neighbor who owned the collie Max mated with tells Lori that his dog has just had pups and invites her to see the puppies. Most of the puppies look like their mother, with the one exception being a small black puppy that resembles Max, implying that this puppy has inherited Maxs genetic altering....or at least his fathers attitude.
