==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews. It currently holds an 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.9/10 and the critical consensus being: "Made by a metalhead, this documentary of the musical genre both informs and entertains with its range of interviewees." 

==Criticism==
Some brief controversy arose over the films depiction of black metal, which many fans of the genre saw as being one-sided and biased during a screening documented in the film.  In the special features to the DVD of the film, Dunn attempted a restitution to the concerns of the black metal fans by including an additional featurette.
