Written and directed by Leonard Farlinger, the film centres on Ryan (Colm Feore) and Theo (David Cubitt) Taylor, estranged brothers reunited by their fathers death. Growing up, Ryan was the "perfect son" and Theo was the "black sheep" who struggled with drug addiction. When Ryan reveals that he is dying of AIDS, however, the brothers attempt to repair their relationship.

Both Feore and Cubitt were nominated for Best Actor at the 21st Genie Awards, although neither won.
