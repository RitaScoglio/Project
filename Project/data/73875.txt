==Production==
 ]]
 conglomerate owned Paramount, felt strongly about developing the Dominican Republic as a movie-making site.

The Lake Tahoe house and grounds portrayed in the film are Fleur du Lac, the summer estate of Henry J. Kaiser on the California side of the lake. The only structures used in the movie that still remain are the complex of old native stone boathouses with their wrought iron gates. Although Fleur du Lac is private property and no one is allowed ashore there, the boathouses and multi-million dollar condominiums may be viewed from the lake.

Unlike with the first film, Coppola was given near-complete control over production. In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film. The Godfather Part II DVD commentary featuring Francis Ford Coppola,   

Production nearly ended before it began when Pacinos lawyers told Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved and the production went forward. 

Coppola discusses his decision to make this the first major motion picture to use "Part II" in its title in the Audio commentary|directors commentary on the DVD edition of the film released in 2002. Paramount was initially opposed because they believed the audience would not be interested in an addition to a story they had already seen. But the director prevailed, and the films success began the common practice of numbered sequels. 
 
Still, three weeks prior to the release, film critics and journalists pronounced Part II a disaster. The cross-cutting between Vito and Michaels parallel stories were judged too frequent, not allowing enough time to leave a lasting impression on the audience. Coppola and the editors returned to the cutting room to change the films narrative structure, but could not complete the work in time, leaving the final scenes poorly timed at the opening. 

==Box office==
The Godfather Part II did not surpass the original film commercially, but in North America it grossed $47.5 million on a $13 million budget.  It was Paramount Pictures highest-grossing film of 1974 and was the 1974 in film|fifth-highest-grossing picture in North America that year.

==Reception== world cinemas greatest achievements. Many critics compare it favorably with the original although it is rarely ranked higher on lists of "greatest" films.

The Godfather Part II:
* Was featured on Sight and Sound s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1992 and 2002.
* Is ranked #7 on Entertainment Weekly s list of the "100 Greatest Movies of All Time".

* Is ranked #1 on TV Guide s 1998 list of the "50 Greatest Movies of All Time on TV and Video". 

Pacinos performance in The Godfather Part II has been lauded as perhaps his best, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was criticized for not awarding him the Academy Award for Best Actor, which that year went to Art Carney for his role in Harry and Tonto. It is now regarded as one of the greatest performances in film history. In 2006, Premiere (magazine)|Premiere issued its list of "The 100 Greatest Performances of all Time", putting Pacinos performance at #20.  Later in 2009, Total Film issued "The 150 Greatest Performances of All Time", ranking Pacinos performance fourth place. 

==Releases for television and video==
 

Coppola created The Godfather Saga expressly for American television in a 1975 release that combined The Godfather and The Godfather Part II with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977. In 1981, Paramount released the Godfather Epic boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. Coppola returned to the film again in 1992 when he updated that release with footage from The Godfather Part III and more unreleased material. This home viewing release, under the title The Godfather Trilogy 1901â€“1980, had a total run time of 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes), not including the sets bonus documentary by Jeff Werner on the making of the films, "The Godfather Family: A Look Inside".

The Godfather DVD Collection was released on October 9, 2001 in a package  that contained all three filmsâ€”each with a commentary track by Coppolaâ€”and a bonus disc that featured a 73-minute documentary from 1991 entitled The Godfather Family: A Look Inside and other miscellany about the film: the additional scenes originally contained in The Godfather Saga; Francis Coppolas Notebook (a look inside a notebook the director kept with him at all times during the production of the film); rehearsal footage; a promotional featurette from 1971; and video segments on Gordon Williss cinematography, Nino Rotas and Carmine Coppolas music, the director, the locations and Mario Puzos screenplays. The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a "Godfather" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches. The Godfather DVD Collection   

The restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for The Godfather Part III, when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was "terrific".

===Restoration===
After a careful restoration of the first two movies, The Godfather movies were released on DVD and   of Film Preserve. The Blu-ray Disc box set (four discs) includes high-definition extra features on the restoration and film. They are included on Disc 5 of the DVD box set (five discs).

Other extras are ported over from Paramounts 2001 DVD release. There are slight differences between the repurposed extras on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets, with the HD box having more content.

<!-- * In the chapter "The Speeches We Keep in Our Heads", from her 1998 book Simply Speaking, Ronald Reagans speechwriter and former television writer, Peggy Noonan, explains what makes "Lee Strasbergs great speech, given as Hyman Roth stood, weak and furious, before cold-eyed Michael Corleone" powerful and memorable. She urges: 
::"Stop here and go out and rent The Godfather, Part II. In the middle of that movie, you will find a speech that is one of the most famous of our time, and that a lot of people keep parts of in their heads.
