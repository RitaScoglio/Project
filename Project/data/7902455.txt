Hitman is a 2007 action film directed by   starring Rupert Friend as Agent 47.

==Plot==
At an unknown location, near a remote asylum, a group of young bald boys are receiving tattoos of bar codes on the back of their heads as well as men observing, directing and co-ordinating the training of these young boys in firearms and hand-to-hand combat, as well as stamina and strength. In these scenes, it is shown that these young boys are trained from an early age to be professional, international Contract killing|hitmen-for hire.

Years later, Interpol agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) arrives at his house and discovers Agent 47 (Olyphant) in his study, where the two talk about 47s life as a professional hitman, working for a mysterious unknown paramilitary organization known as The Organization. The movie unfolds as he tells the story, and Whittier trying to capture him.

Three months prior, 47 is completing a hit on a gang leader named Bwana Ovie (Eriq Ebouaney) in Niger. He is told by his Agency contact, Diana (Lisa Jacobs), to kill his next target, Russian President Mikhail Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), publicly. He completes his mission as ordered, but before he can leave Russia, he is contacted by his employers. They tell him that there is a witness to the assassination and order him to intercept her. When Agent 47 pulls his gun to shoot her on the street, he realizes shes never seen him before. He doesnt shoot her, but just misses being assassinated himself.

His employers reveal his location to agents of Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB, who make plans to intercept him. As he is about to be taken, Diana personally calls him to warn him. She tells him that Belicoff ordered the hit on himself. After a dramatic escape from the hotel, 47 intercepts Nika (Olga Kurylenko), the woman who supposedly witnessed his hit and Belicoffs mistress. He interrogates her about Belicoff and discovers that Belicoff had a body double, who ordered the hit on the real Belicoff so that he could take his place as the president of Russia. 47 was to be killed after the hit to ensure total secrecy.
 James Faulkner) of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA. He offers Smith a deal - he will kill Udre Belicoff (Henry Ian Cusick), Mikhails brother, in exchange for a favor from the CIA. Udre is an arms dealer and slave trader whom both the CIA and FSB have wanted dead for some time. Agent Smith informs 47 that Udre had been planning something with a German arms dealer named Price. Intercepting him could lead 47 to Udre.

47 and Nika travel to Istanbul, where 47 abducts Price from a restaurant in order to pose as Price at a meeting with Udre. 47 later kills Udre and his henchmen, so Belicoffs double is forced to attend Udres funeral. 47 kidnaps Agent Marklov and forces him to have his own FSB agents try to shoot Belicoffs double as he delivers a eulogy for Udre. Disguised as a soldier, 47 manages to kill all of Belicoffs doubles guards and takes him into the archbishops chamber in the church. 47 instead kills him and then allows himself to be taken into custody by Interpol and Agent Whittier.

At this point Agent Smith delivers on his end of the deal, having the agents under his command intercept the Interpol convoy that is transporting 47 to the airport, giving 47 the distraction necessary to escape. The scene then flashes forward to the conversation between Agent Whittier and 47 occurring at Agent Whittiers house. After wrapping up their conversation, 47 reveals the body of a dead hitman. 47 suggests Agent Whittier go along with 47s plan, saying that he will notify the police that he has killed the fake Agent 47, implying that Whittier will not survive if he does not.

Nika is shown picking up an envelope from an undisclosed sender. Inside it, there are papers and a message saying that she now owns a vineyard (she had told 47 of her childhood dream of having one). Meanwhile, 47 is watching her from afar, through the scope of a sniper rifle. He then looks at the corpse of another hitman, lying close to him, and says, "I told you to leave her alone. You should have listened." He then turns back, and walks away.

==Production== Eidos and IO Interactive entered negotiations with Hollywood production companies to adapt the video game to film.  Twentieth Century Fox eventually acquired the rights and hired screenwriter Skip Woods to pen the screenplay, with actor Vin Diesel executive producing and starring in the film.  In December 2006, Diesel stepped down from the role. In January 2007, Olyphant was cast as the lead with director Xavier Gens at the helm.    In March, actor Dougray Scott was cast as Agent 47s nemesis, with Olga Kurylenko, Robert Knepper, Ulrich Thomsen, and Michael Offei also joining the cast. Production began the week of March 27, 2007 in Sofia, Bulgaria and lasted 12 weeks.  A second unit also shot in locations including London, Istanbul, St. Petersburg, and Cape Town.   

The release of the film was set back a few months to allow for the reshooting of several scenes. These included a sword fight between 4 assassins in a train car, which replaced the original train platform sequence where Agent 47 fought only one assassin. Reports before the films release confirmed that not only were reshoots were taking place, but that Fox had fired Gens and denied him final cut. Nicolas de Toth was brought in at this stage to soften the edit and cut down material. 
 Dark Angel, which was also owned by Twentieth Century Fox in an effort to save money. Xavier Gens told an interviewer that whilst they are not directly dealing with the clone storyline, one scene (the original train station sequence) showing a bald, barcoded assassin (Jean-Marc Bellu) following Agent 47 (Olyphant), another bald, barcoded assassin, is very explicit and showed his intention to keep him as a clone.  The detail was likely changed to accommodate for the casting of actors of mixed races during reshoots, making it impossible for them to be clones (or at least clones of the same person).
