Reaching safety, she introduces herself as Katherine Wells from the British colony of Gibraltar. While she demonstrates her gratitude with sexual favors, they are interrupted by the minions of Ard, an immortal man who wants to obtain the Loc-Nar for himself. He orders Den to get the Loc-Nar from the Queen, who performed the ritual. Den agrees, and infiltrates the palace, but is promptly caught by the Queen, who offers leniency if he has sex with her. He complies, distracting the Queen while the raiding party steals the Loc-Nar. Den escapes and races back to rescue Katherine from Ard.

===Captain Sternn=== Lincoln F. Sternn is on trial for numerous serious charges (and one moving violation) presented by the prosecutor. Pleading "not guilty" against the advice of his lawyer, Sternn explains that he expects to be acquitted because he bribed a witness, Hanover Fiste. Fiste takes the stand, but his perjury is subverted when the Loc-Nar, now the size of a marble, causes him to blurt out the truth about Sternns evil deeds. Fiste rants with such fury that he changes into a muscled giant and chases Sternn throughout the station, breaking through bulkheads and wreaking havoc. Eventually, he corners Sternn, receives his promised payoff, and promptly shrinks back to his gangly original form. Sternn opens a trapdoor under Fiste, ejecting him into space. The Loc-Nar enters Earths atmosphere with Fistes flaming hand still clinging to it.

===Neverwhere Land=== Captain Sternn to #B-17|B-17.

The story follows the influence of the Loc-Nar upon the evolution of a planet, from the Loc-Nar landing in a body of water, influencing the rise of the industrial age, and a world war. This original story was created by Cornelius Cole III.

The original rough animatics are set to a loop of the beginning of Pink Floyds "Time". The 1996 VHS release included this segment at the beginning of the tape. On the DVD release, this segment is included within the bonus features. In both released versions, the sequence is set to the music of "Passacaglia" (from Magnificat), composed and conducted by Krzysztof Penderecki.

===B-17===
A World War II B-17 bomber nicknamed the "Pacific Pearl" makes a difficult bombing run with heavy damage and casualties. As the bomber limps home, the co-pilot goes back to check on the crew. Finding nothing but dead bodies, he notices the Loc-Nar trailing the plane. Informing the pilot, he heads back to the cockpit, when the Loc-Nar rams itself into the plane and reanimates the dead crew members as zombies. The co-pilot is killed, while the pilot parachutes away in time. He lands on an island where he finds a graveyard of airplanes from various times, along with the wrecked airplanes zombified airmen.

===Taarna=== Daniel Goldberg and Len Blum; inspired by Jean Giraud|Moebius Arzach stories.

The Loc-Nar, now the size of a giant meteor, crashes into a volcano, changing a tribe of human outcasts into mutated barbarians who ravage a peaceful city. The elders desperately try to summon the last of a warrior race, the Taarakians. Taarna, a strong, beautiful, Taarakian warrior maiden, arrives too late to stop the massacre and resolves to avenge the city. Her search leads to the barbarians stronghold, where she is captured, tortured, and left for dead. With the help of her Taarakian mount, she escapes and confronts the barbarian leader. Though wounded, she defeats him. With Taarna readying her final attack on the Loc-Nar, it tells her not to sacrifice herself, as she cannot destroy it. She does not relent, and her self-sacrifice destroys the Loc-Nar.

===Epilogue===
As the final story ends, the Loc-Nar terrorizing the girl is similarly destroyed, blowing the mansion to pieces. Taarnas mount, reborn, appears outside and the girl happily flies away on it. It is then revealed that Taarnas soul has been transferred across space and time to her. This is further signified by the change in hair color the girl now exhibits and the revelation of the Taarakian mark on her neck. Thus the girl is revealed to be the next Taarakian herself, destined to defend the universe from evil for another generation.

==Production==

===Animation===
The film uses the rotoscoping technique of animation in several shots.    This process consists of shooting models and actors, then tracing the shot onto film for animation purposes.  The B-17 bomber was shot using a 10-foot replica, which was then animated. Additionally, Taarna the Taarakian was rotoscoped, using Toronto model Carole Desbiens as a model for the animated character. The shot of the exploding house near the end of the movie was originally to be rotoscoped, but as the films release date had been moved up from October/November to August 7, 1981, a lack of time prevented this. This remains as the only non-animated sequence in the film.   

==Release==

===Box office===
The film was released on August 7, 1981. The release grossed nearly $20,000,000.   

===Critical reception===
Critical response was generally dismissive with some reviewers making positive comments. Review aggregator  , juvenile, and dated, but Heavy Metal makes up for its flaws with eye-popping animation and a classic, smartly-used soundtrack." 

Janet Maslin of The New York Times noted that the film "was scored very well, with music much less ear-splitting than the title would suggest."  Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 stars out of 4 in his Movie Guide, calling the feature "...uneven, but great fun on a mindless, adolescent level." 

===Audience reaction=== cult attraction midnight theatrical bootleg copies.

==Home media== VHS and Laserdisc in 1996, the film was re-released to select theaters on March 8, 1996 taking in $550,000.    The subsequent home video release moved over one million units. 

The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on February 1, 2011 as a Best Buy exclusive and it was later released everywhere on June 14.

The legal difficulties surrounding the use of some songs in the movie delayed its release to home video. The production companys use of some songs were limited solely to the theatrical release and soundtrack and did not include home video releases. It was not until 1996 that there was an official home video release on VHS when Kevin Eastman, who had bought the publishing rights of Heavy Metal magazine in 1992 and previously contributed to the magazine, reached a settlement with the music copyright holders.

However, Entertainment Weekly quoted Tim Miller as saying "David really believes in the project. Its just a matter of time."
