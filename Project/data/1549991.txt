==Plot==
Vivian Abromowitzs family are penniless nomads, moving from one cheap apartment to another in Beverly Hills, so that Vivian and her brothers can attend the citys prestigious schools. Their father, Murray, is a divorced 65-year-old who refuses to retire, working as an unsuccessful Oldsmobile salesman.

Vivians wealthy Uncle Mickey regularly sends the family money to help them survive. When Mickeys 29-year-old daughter Rita runs away from a rehab facility, Murray offers her shelter if Mickey will pay for a plush apartment. Vivian must babysit her adult cousin, making sure she gets to nursing school and avoids pills and booze. But Vivian has her own problems: shes curious about sex, likes an older neighbor kid (Eliot), has inherited her mothers ample breasts, and wants a family that doesnt embarrass her.

Vivians older brother Ben aspires to a show business career, while her dad aspires to feminine companionship but wont give in to a wealthy lady-friends desire that he send his kids back East to live with his estranged wife. Vivians younger brother Rickey simply aspires to get attention.
 their own invented language. Vivian learns that Rita has no desire to go to nursing school and also has no clue as to what to do with her life. Murray attempts to cover up Ritas lack of progress at nursing school, when Mickey asks for progress reports. Eventually, Mickey, frustrated at having to support his brothers family and also learning of their deception concerning his daughter, explodes during a meeting between the two families, telling Murray hes tired of sending them money.

===Critical reception===
The movie received positive to mixed reviews from critics. The design of the seventies, the humor and the acting have been described as "dead-on".

*Roger Ebert said of lead actress Natasha Lyonne, "Lyonne has the films most important role, and is the key to the comedy. She does a good job of looking incredulous, and theres a lot in her life to be incredulous about. She also has a nice pragmatic approach to sexuality, as in a scene where she consults a plastic surgeon about on-the-spot breast reduction." He also said, "But basically I enjoyed Slums of Beverly Hills—for the wisecracking, for the family squabbles, for the notion of squatters who stake a claim in a Beverly Hills where money, after all, is not the only currency." (He awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars.)

*San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Ruthe Stein stated, "While touching on serious issues such as loss, this coming-of-age story is first and foremost a comedy, and a hilarious one at that. It never strains to be funny. The humor derives from the deadpan responses of family members to circumstances beyond their control." She also stated, "Set in the mid-70s, Slums gets the period right, from the burnt orange shag carpet on the floor of the familys temporary digs to the dorky clothes and extreme hairstyles. Even the saleslady who sells Vivian her first bra has the overly made-up look of the time. The Abramowitzes behavior when they go out to eat—complaining about the service and that theres too much salt in the food—may seem to border on a Jewish stereotype. But its also dead-on".

*On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie is currently certified "Fresh and is described as "Warm, real, and hilarious."
