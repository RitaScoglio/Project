 Golden Raspberry "Governors Award" was created as an excuse to present the film with a Razzie. However, the film was better received by the Teen Choice Awards, as it was nominated for two Choice Movie Breakout Stars (for Guarini and Clarkson) and Choice Chemistry.

Time Magazine described the film as "a monstrous Idol movie musical that in the most generous light is the worst film so far this century".   Josh Tyrangiel. Time Magazine  February 05, 2006 (Subscription Required).  In a later interview, Clarkson admitted she only did the film because she was contractually obligated to do so: "I knew when I read the script it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper, and I could not get out of it."  

Total Film magazine ranked the film at number 16 in their list of 66 Worst Movies Of All Time.
