Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County who is prosecuting social studies teacher and activist Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard) for firebombing the pharmaceutical corporation Grant and Strictland.  Forrester denies this, but claims that Grant and Strictland has been engaging in illegal animal experimentation.  This distances Douglas from his daughter Carly (Zena Grey), one of Forresters students.
 sacred dog named Khyi Yang Po (a Bearded Collie) from a Tibetan monastery.The scientists determine that Khyi Yang Pos genetic sequence, when isolated and put into a vaccination, invades and alters the cells and DNA of a victim.

When Dave returns from work, he takes the dog out in the garage, then the dog runs to get the newspaper.  The dog gives him his newspaper, but as Dave reaches for it, Khyi Yang Po bites him on the hand. The saliva goes into Daves blood and DNA, infecting him.

Dave is taken to the lab to be Animal euthanasia|euthanized, but Kozak has a court summons, and must deal with Dave later. Right before he exits, Kozak mocks Dave in canine form and is bitten in the process. He then begins to exhibit the same issues Dave had at the beginning of his adventure; Dave had successfully transferred the gene sequence into Kozak. 
 mocks Kozak by implying he was working under Strictlands shadow, and angers him. The two begin growling at each another, and the judge, exasperated by Daves canine behavior, orders the bailiff to remove him.  Kozak is now arrested. The pharmaceutical company is returned to Strictland, the mutant animals are protected, and Dave is able to spend more time with his family.

==Reception==
The Shaggy Dog received negative reviews from film critics. BBC called Allen uninteresting and said he "only stops short of canine reproduction|leg-humping in his attempts to win our affections."  The film was on Richard Roepers Worst films of 2006 list. Roger Ebert gave it 2 stars out of 4. It currently holds a 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However, the film proved to be a commercial success, grossing over $87 million worldwide against its $50 million budget.  The film earned three Razzie Award nominations including Worst Actor for Tim Allen, Worst Remake or Ripoff and Worst Excuse for Family Entertainment,  but failed to win any of those categories.  In 2006, Disney released a remake of the movie with Tim Allen as a 50-something Dave Douglas. This film has an entirely different story, characters, and transformation plot device unrelated to the original trilogy. To tie-in with the theatrical release of the 2006 remake, the original 1959 movie was re-issued in the USA as a special DVD labeled "The Wild & Woolly Edition," which featured the movie in two forms: one in the original black and white, the other a colorized version. The colorized version however is not restored and suffers from age. In the UK, however, the 1959 movie has only ever been made available on DVD in black and white.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to The Shaggy Dog was released on March 14, 2006.
