==Plot==
In late 1890s Wyoming, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) is the affable, clever, talkative leader of the outlaw Hole in the Wall Gang. His closest companion is the laconic Sharpshooter|dead-shot "Sundance Kid" (Robert Redford). The two return to their hideout at Hole-in-the-Wall (Wyoming) to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Butchs long absences, have selected Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy) as their new leader. Harvey challenges Butch to a knife fight over the gangs leadership. Butch defeats him using trickery, but embraces Harveys idea to rob the Union Pacific Overland Flyer train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and likely reap even more money than the first.

Butch and Sundance finally elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Etta that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head E. H. Harriman to remain on their trail until Butch and Sundance are both killed.

Butch suggests "going straight", and he and Sundance land their first honest job as payroll guards for a mining company. However, they are ambushed by local bandits on their first run and their boss, Percy Garris (Strother Martin), is killed. Butch and Sundance ambush and kill the bandits, the first time Butch has ever shot someone. Etta recommends farming or ranching as other lines of work, but they conclude the straight life isnt for them. Sensing they will be killed if they return to robbery, Etta decides to go back to the United States.

They take cover in a building but are both seriously wounded, after Butch makes a futile attempt to run to the mules in order to bring more ammunition, while Sundance provides cover fire.

===Screenplay===
William Goldman first came across the story of Butch Cassidy in the late 1950s and researched it on and off for eight years before sitting down to write the screenplay.  Goldman later stated:
 The whole reason I wrote the... thing, there is that famous line that Scott Fitzgerald wrote, who was one of my heroes, There are no second acts in American lives. When I read about Cassidy and Longbaugh and the superposse coming after them - thats phenomenal material. They ran to South America and lived there for eight years and that was what thrilled me: they had a second act. They were more legendary in South America than they had been in the old West... Its a great story. Those two guys and that pretty girl going down to South America and all that stuff. It just seems to me its a wonderful piece of material. Egan, p. 90   
Goldman says he wrote the story as an original screenplay because he did not want to do the research to make it authentic as a novel. 

===Development===
According to Goldman, when he first wrote the script and sent it out for consideration, only one studio wanted to buy it—and that was with the proviso that the two lead characters did not flee to South America. When Goldman protested that that was what had happened, the studio head responded, "I dont give a shit. All I know is John Wayne dont run away." Egan, p. 91 

Goldman rewrote the script, "didnt change it more than a few pages, and subsequently found that every studio wanted it." 
 
According to the supplemental material on the Blu-ray disc release, Richard Zanuck at 20th Century Fox purchased the script, originally called The Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy, for $400,000, double the price the studios board of directors had authorized. 

The role of Sundance was offered to Jack Lemmon, whose production company, JML, had produced the film Cool Hand Luke (1967) starring Newman. Lemmon, however, turned down the role; he did not like riding horses, and he felt he had already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kids character before.

 Batman and Robin episode."  Time also criticized the films score as absurd and anachronistic.

Roger Eberts review of the movie was a mixed 2.5 out of 4 stars. "The movie starts promisingly... a scene where Butch puts down a rebellion in his gang   one of the best things in the movie... And then we meet Sundances girlfriend, played by Katharine Ross, and the scenes with the three of them have you thinking youve wandered into a really first-rate film." But after Harriman hires his posse, Ebert thought the movies quality declined: "Hill apparently spent a lot of money to take his company on location for these scenes, and I guess when he got back to Hollywood he couldnt bear to edit them out of the final version. So the Super-posse chases our heroes unceasingly, until weve long since forgotten how well the movie started." The dialogue in the final scenes is "so bad we cant believe a word anyone says. And then the violent, bloody ending is also a mistake; apparently it was a misguided attempt to copy "Bonnie and Clyde...." we dont believe it, and we walk out of the theater wondering what happened to that great movie we were seeing until an hour ago." 

The Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay #11 on its list of 101 Greatest Screenplays ever written.
