==Plot== the first film. Val has moved away and married Rhonda, while Earl has squandered his fortune on a failing ostrich ranch. He is approached by Carlos Ortega, who informs him that graboids are killing his workers at his oil field in Sonora, Mexico. Earl initially refuses his assistance, but Ortegas taxi driver, Grady Hoover, convinces Earl to change his mind and joins Earl in the hunt, with the oil company paying Grady full fees for his services, as well. Upon arrival in Sonora, Earl meets geologist Kate Reilly, and her assistant Julio, who are scientifically investigating the graboids.
 hollowed out by something, as sacs are found within the carcass. The radios go out as Pedros truck comes into view and stops across a plain. Grady and Earl walk to the truck and find only the mans arms remaining and the engine motor ripped apart. They hike to a radio tower, only to discover it destroyed. While breaking into a parked car, they encounter several graboid-looking creatures, later named shriekers, that have apparently come from their graboid. Meanwhile, Burts truck is ambushed by a herd of shriekers while returning to base.

It works at first, but he soon warms up and the shriekers detect him, forcing Earl to throw the detonator among Burts supplies before escaping. The group runs a considerable distance before the explosives level the facility, destroying all the shriekers.

As they examine the remains, Earl and Kate (who happens to be a Playboy centerfold whom he had admired for years) decide to pursue each other romantically, while Grady realizes that Ortega owes them for 28 graboids—not accounting for the Shriekers too—and suggests they open their own theme park: "Grady and Earls Monster World".

==Production==

===Development===
Tremors II: Aftershocks began production in 1993 when MCA Universal (feature films division) liked the script. The film was originally planned to be filmed in Australia on a 17 million-dollar budget. Unfortunately, due to distributional and promotional cost for a theater release, the feature film division lost interest. The film was later given the green light, by the MCA/Universal home video division, for everything but the 17 million dollar budget and Australian location. Finally, after many actors and technical experts lowering their rates, and several major special effects sequences scrapped, the film was made on a 4 million dollar budget    and filmed in a total of 27 days.  The film was also released straight-to-video with no theater release. 

===Props===
In Tremors II, the creature design team, Amalgamated Dynamics, was faced with a challenge different from the first film. In Tremors, the graboids spend most of their time underground, and thus a prop was not needed for these scenes. However in Tremors II, the shriekers spend all their time above ground and there are always more shriekers than graboids, thus the need for more props. The shrieker props used in the film include two fully articulated, full-scale puppet shrieker,    three hand-puppet versions of the shriekers,    and three un-jointed non-articulated rubber shrieker dummies.    The fully articulated, full-scale puppet shrieker required 16 puppeteers to operate,    the rubber shrieker dummies, not requiring puppeteers, where used in scenes when a shrieker needed to be dropped, shot, or exploded. 

One of the full scale graboids used in the film was a refurbished model that was used in the first film. 

===Effects===
To achieve the infrared view of the shriekers as seen in several scenes, the actors wore red suits and yellow stockings, then were shot in Hi-8 video tape and blown up to 35-mm film to add an additional grainy effect. The post-production video engineers then rendered the faces and bodies in different colors. 

The scene where a baby shrieker is seen was created using a full size shrieker in a large cage, making the shrieker look small. As a consequence, no actors could be shown at the same time as the cage and shrieker. 

In addition to the shriekers designed by Amalgamated Dynamics, some scenes in the film utilized shriekers that were computer generated imagery (CGI) designed by Tippett Studio.  These animated shriekers were used when ever the film depicts them as walking, running, or climbing, as these movements were beyond the capabilities of the fully articulated puppet shriekers. 

==Release==
 
The exclusive premiere screening for Tremors II: Aftershocks took place on April 9, 1996 at 8 PM in the Alfred Hitchcock Theater. The film was released on Videocassette on April 9, 1996 and on laserdisc on April 16, 1996. 

==Reception==
 
As of May, 2013, Tremors II: Aftershocks currently holds a 63% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 8 reviews.
