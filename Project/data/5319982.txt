In addition, several near-riots occurred over the price of tickets, as well as during several of the performances that took place over the weekend, especially Jimi Hendrixs last billed performance in England. 
 Sir Douglas Osmond, who emphasised the peaceful nature of the event in his evidence given to the Stevenson Report, 1971, (submitted to parliament as evidence in favour of future Isle of Festivals) "...By the end of the festival the press representatives became almost desperate for material and they seemed a little disappointed that the patrons had been so well behaved."

Due to financial difficulties, Message to Love wasnt released until 1997, 27 years after the event, after premiering at a San Jose film festival in 1995.  A CD of the soundtrack was also issued by Castle Communications/Sony Legacy in 1997.
