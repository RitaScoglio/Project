 Mickey Mouse theatrical cartoon produced in over 30 years. With the exception of re-releases, Mickey had not appeared in movie theaters since the short film The Simple Things (1953). Many additional characters seen in the film had also not appeared in a theatrical cartoon for several decades. The film was also the last time in which Clarence Nash voiced Donald Duck. Nash was the only original voice actor in the film as Walt Disney (Mickey Mouse) and Pinto Colvig (Goofy) had died in the 1960s, Cliff Edwards (Jiminy Cricket) and Billy Gilbert (Willie the Giant) in 1971, and Billy Bletcher (Pete and the Big Bad Wolf) in 1979.

==Synopsis== Victorian England is in the merry spirit of Christmas,  Ebenezer Scrooge (Scrooge McDuck) thinks only of the money he has made and of making more (apparently, he charges people 80% interest, compounded daily). While Scrooges selfish thoughts cascade in his head, Bob Cratchit (Mickey Mouse), exhausted and underpaid (a meager two shillings and a Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha′penny per day), continues to work long and hard for him. Cratchit hesitantly asks for a "half day off" for Christmas, to which Scrooge replies it will be unpaid. When collectors Rat and Mole, along with beggars on the streets, kindly ask for a simple donation, Scrooge responds to Rat and Mole that if he does, the poor will no longer be poor and thus they (the collectors) will be out of work, "and you   ask me to do that, not on Christmas Eve." Scrooges cheery nephew Fred (Donald Duck) invites his crotchety uncle to a holiday feast fit for a Roman emperor—roast goose with chestnut dressing, candied fruits, and cinnamon cake with lemon glaze. Scrooge turns him down flat, stating that such rich festive cuisine gives him digestive and other health difficulties.

Later, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Jacob Marley (Goofy), Scrooges greedy former business partner who had died seven years earlier. Due to his cruelty in life, he is doomed to wear heavy chains for eternity. He warns that a similar fate will befall Scrooge unless he changes his ways and that Scrooge will be visited by three spirits. Marley then leaves, falling down the stairs when he tries to avoid tripping over Scrooges cane again (complete with the "Goofy holler").

At the stroke of 1:00, the first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past (Jiminy Cricket), shows Scrooge his past. His obsession of money led him to break the heart of his fiancee Isabelle (Daisy Duck) by foreclosing on the honeymoon cottages mortgage (Isabelles last payment on it was an hour late.).
 Tiny Tim, is revealed to be ill, and Willie foretells tragedy if the familys hapless life does not change. However, just when Scrooge is desperate to know Tims fate, the Ghost of Christmas Present disappears, and the house goes into complete darkness.
 Black Pete), takes Scrooge to the future in a cemetery|graveyard. When he sees Bob mourning Tiny Tims death, Scrooge is horrified and asks whether this future can be changed.

Two gravediggers (Weasels from The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad) are amused that no one attended someones funeral while digging a grave. After the weasels leave to take a break from their work, the ghost reveals the grave to be Scrooges by lighting a match. The ghost shoves him into his grave calling him "the richest man in the cemetery." Despite his pleas that he will repent, Scrooge falls into an empty coffin which bursts open to Hell.

However, Scrooge suddenly awakens on Christmas Day. Having been given another chance, he throws his coat over his nightshirt, puts on his slippers, dons his cane and top hat, and goes to visit the Cratchits, cheerfully donating generous amounts of money along the way (including 100 gold sovereigns to Rat and Mole; the charity collectors from earlier) and telling Fred that he will come after all. He tries to play a joke on Bob, dragging in a large sack supposedly filled with laundry and announcing gruffly that there will be extra work in the future. But to the Cratchits joy, the sack is instead filled with toys and a big turkey for dinner. Scrooge gives Bob a raise and makes him his partner in the counting house, and Tiny Tim proclaims "God bless us, everyone!"

==Reception==
Film critic Leonard Maltin said that rather than being “a pale attempt to imitate the past”, the film is “cleverly written, well staged, and animated with real spirit and a sense of fun.”  Robin Allan stated that the film calls to mind the similarities between Walt Disney and Charles Dickens, in terms of both the work they produced and their work ethic. 
 At the Movies gave it “two thumbs down”. Siskel felt there wasnt enough emphasis on Mickeys character and that it didnt rank with most of Disneys full-length animated features. Ebert stated that it lacked the magic of visual animation that the “Disney people are famous for” and that it was a “forced march” through the Charles Dickens story without any ironic spin. 
 Academy Award as Best Animated Short Subject of 1983.

==Releases== UK on The Jungle US on ABC (2000, 2003), before moving permanently to ABC Family (2001&ndash;present). It was aired on Toon Disney in 2008. The run on ABC Family includes Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too and was part of their "25 Days of Christmas", but with several abrupt edits including the "Chocolate Pot Roast with Yogurt" line.
In Canada, it airs on CBC Television|CBC, and has been aired every Christmas season since 1985. It typically airs the Sunday before Christmas.

The short is also featured, without its opening credits, in the direct-to-home release,  . It is also available on the ninth volume of the Walt Disney Classic Cartoon Favorites DVD collection, as well as in the     version. The short is also on the Disney Animation Collection Volume 7 DVD (1.33:1). On November 5, 2013, the 30th Anniversary Edition of this short was released on DVD and for the first time on Blu-ray; however, it was further cropped to 1.78:1 widescreen   and featured a heavy use of noise reduction. Various other shorts were included in the DVD.

The aforementioned broadcasts in the 1980s and early 1990s spanned a full hour, with the first half consisting of the following older cartoon shorts: Donalds Snow Fight, Plutos Christmas Tree, and The Art of Skiing.  Each of the four items in the program was preceded by a narrative wraparound segment in which one of the Disney cartoon characters (Donald, Pluto (with Mickey translating), Goofy, and Mickey, respectively) would talk about his favorite Christmas, thus leading into the cartoon in question.  From 1988 onwards, The Art of Skiing was excluded from the annual broadcast, replaced at the end of the hour by one segment or another.  The 1993 telecast, for example, featured a behind-the-scenes featurette on The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Later broadcasts simply reduced the timeslot to half an hour, showing Mickeys Christmas Carol by itself.

A clip of this film in Swedish was shown on Donald Ducks 50th Birthday to illustrate Donalds international appeal.

This short film was featured in Disneys Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse. The shot of Mickey holding Tiny Tims crutch is also seen in the opening of Epic Mickey.
