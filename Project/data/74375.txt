==Plot==
In 1951 Norman Dale arrives in the rural southwest Indiana town of Hickory to become a high school teacher and head basketball coach.  He was hired by Cletus Summers, the principal and a longtime friend of Dales.  Dale had lost a previous collegiate coaching position after striking one of his players so the job is something of a last chance for him.

Like much of the state, Hickory is passionate about basketball. At an impromptu meeting with townsmen at the local barber shop shortly after his arrival, Dale is questioned rather pointedly and intensely by the men and then offends them by leaving before they have all had their say about what they expect of him. People are aware that the best player in town, Jimmy Chitwood, does not intend to play on this seasons team due to his attachment to the previous coach and the concern of hometown faculty member Myra Fleener, who has been looking after Jimmy since his mothers illness.  Myra warns Dale not to try to persuade Jimmy to change his mind; she believes he needs to focus on academics in order to get a scholarship to attend college and have a chance to leave town for a better future.  Dale has no intention of going after Jimmy.  In fact, Dale talks to Jimmy while he is shooting baskets in the schoolyard and tells him that playing on the team is ultimately Jimmys choice and that Dale doesnt care whether or not Jimmy eventually joins the team.

The school enrollment is so small that Dale has only seven players on his squad. At his first practice, Dale immediately dismisses the acting coach, George, one of the townsmen.  George tells Dale not to "screw up" the team and issues a veiled threat.  Minutes into addressing the players for the first time, Dale dismisses one, Buddy Walker, for not paying attention and talking while the coach is talking. Another, Whit Butcher, walks out in support of his friend, leaving Dale with only 5 players, the minimum needed to play.  He then begins drilling the remaining five players (Rade Butcher, Merle Webb, Everett Flatch, Strap Purl, and Ollie McLellan) with fundamentals and conditioning but no scrimmages or shooting, much to the players dislike.  Townsmen who have heard of the coachs non-traditional approach to working with the team intrude on a practice and demand to know what Dale is doing. Whits father however arrives with his son in tow and makes his son apologize to Dale for walking out and ask for another chance.  Mr. Butcher then shows his support of Dale by ushering the townsmen out of the gym.  Later Mr. Butcher will join Dale on the bench.

With the team having worked on a four-pass offense, Dale remains committed to this approach in the opening game of the season, even when Rade Butcher disobeys him and repeatedly shoots successfully without passing.  Dale benches him and, when another player fouls out, refuses to let Rade return to the game, leaving his team with only four players on the floor to the jeers of the home crowd.  In a subsequent game, when an opposing player pushes his finger into Dales chest during an on-court argument during a timeout, Rade jumps to his defense and hits the player on the jaw.  After the ensuing brawl, Cletus, who has been assisting Dale in coaching, suffers a mild heart attack.

The coach further alienates the community by having the team play with a slow, defensive style that does not immediately produce results and also by losing his temper, causing him to be ejected from multiple games.   

With Cletus laid up, Dale invites knowledgeable local former star basketball player Shooter Flatch, Everetts alcoholic father, to join him on the bench as a new assistant. This too confounds the town, including Everett. The coach has one major stipulation in order for Shooter to participate with the team: he must be sober at all times around the boys.

By the middle of the season, an emergency town meeting is called to vote on whether Dale should be dismissed. Fleener appreciates the coachs having stayed away from Jimmy and his efforts with Shooter and, despite having learned of Dales past mistake and volatile behavioural pattern as a coach, she unexpectedly expresses support for him at the meeting.  Just as the vote is being counted, Jimmy enters the meeting and asks permission to speak.  He says hes ready to begin playing basketball again, but only if Dale remains as coach.  George reports the ballot count, which has gone against Dale, but Fleeners mother jumps up and calls for a re-vote.  Mr. Butcher calls for a voice vote from the assembly, and the townspeople overwhelmingly vote for Dale to stay as coach.

From this point Hickory becomes a nearly unstoppable team. Along the way Dale proves Shooters value to the townspeople (and to Shooter himself) by intentionally getting himself ejected from a game and forcing Shooter to show his coaching ability.  Shooter does just that by diagramming a play by which Hickory wins the game on a last-second shot.  Despite a setback in which Shooter arrives drunk to a game and ends up in a hospital, the team advances through tournament play with contributions from unsung players, such as the pint-sized Ollie and devoutly religious Strap.
 South Bend, whose integrated players are taller and more athletic.  But with Chitwood scoring at the last second, tiny Hickory takes home the 1952 Indiana state championship.

==Basis== 1954 Indiana Milan High School (   ), but the term "inspired by a true story" may be more appropriate, as there was little the two teams had in common.      

In most U.S. states, high school athletic teams are divided into different classes, usually based on the number of enrolled students, with separate state championship tournaments held for each classification. At the time, Indiana conducted a single state basketball championship for all of its high schools and continued to do so until 1997.  

Some elements of the film do match closely with those of Milans real story. Like the movies "Hickory High School", Milan was a very small high school in a rural, southern Indiana town. Both schools had undersized teams. Both Hickory and Milan won the state finals by two points: Hickory won 42–40, and Milan won 32–30. The final seconds of the Hoosiers state final hold fairly closely to the details of Milans 1954 final; the final shot in the movie was taken from virtually the same spot on the floor as Bobby Plumps actual game-winner. The movies final game was shot in the same building that hosted the 1954 Indiana final, Butler Universitys Hinkle Fieldhouse (called Butler Fieldhouse in 1954) in Indianapolis.  

==Production==
 
 Broad Ripple and Bishop Chatard High School|Chatard, the alma mater of Maris Valainis who played the role of Jimmy Chitwood, obliged, and crowd shots were filmed during their actual game. Fans of both schools came out in period costumes to serve as extras and to supplement the hundreds of locals who had answered the call. At halftime and following the game, actors took to the court to shoot footage of the state championship scenes, including the game-winning shot by Hickory. 

Speculation exists that the character of Norman Dale was named for Norm Ellenberger, whose middle name is Dale. A longtime college assistant coach, he once played basketball for coach Tony Hinkle at Butler. 
 New Richmond Nineveh was used for the majority of the classroom scenes and many other scenes throughout the movie. 
 Knightstown and is now known as the "Hoosier Gym."  

Pizzo and Anspaugh shopped the script for two years before they finally found investment for the project. Despite this seeming approval, the financiers only approved a production budget of $6 million, forcing the crew to hire most of the cast playing the Hickory basketball team and many of the extras from the local community around New Richmond. Gene Hackman also predicted that the movie was going to be a "career killer." Despite the small budget, dire predictions, and little help from distributor Orion Pictures, Hoosiers grossed over $28 million and received two Oscar nominations (Dennis Hopper for Best Supporting Actor and Jerry Goldsmith for Best Original Score).
