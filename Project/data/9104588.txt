==Plot==

The story revolves around Billy Bigelow, a rough-talking, macho, handsome carousel Barker (occupation)|barker, and Julie Jordan, a young, innocent mill worker, both living their busy lives in the small town of Boothbay Harbor, Maine. They fall in love, but both are fired from their jobs for different reasons – Billy because he paid too much attention to Julie and incurred the wrath of the jealous carousel owner Mrs. Mullin, and Julie because she stayed out past the curfew imposed by the understanding but stern mill owner, Mr. Bascombe. Billy and Julie marry and go to live at the seaside spa of her cousin Nettie, but Billy becomes bitter because he is unable to find work, and in his frustration, strikes Julie (this moment is not shown at all in the film). Mrs. Mullin, the jealous carousel owner who is infatuated with him, hears of this and goes to Netties to offer Billy his old job back, but will not re-hire him unless he leaves his wife. Billy seems to be considering the idea when Julie asks to talk privately. Julie, fearing he will be enraged, timidly tells him she is pregnant. But Billy is overjoyed and now firmly refuses Mrs. Mullins offer. However, newly worried about not having enough money to provide for his child, and unskilled at anything except being a carousel barker, Billy secretly agrees to join his pal Jigger Craigin in robbing the wealthy Bascombe.

During a New England clam bake|clambake, held on a nearby island, Billy and Jigger sneak to the mainland to commit the robbery, but Bascombe, who is usually unarmed, carries a gun and the robbery is foiled. While Bascombe is momentarily distracted, Jigger flees and leaves Billy at the mercy of the police. Cornered, but trying to escape, Billy climbs atop a pile of crates, whereupon the pile collapses and Billy accidentally falls on his own knife. The others return from the clambake, and Julie sees the mortally wounded Billy. She rushes over to him and he dies after saying his last words to her. Julie is devastated because she truly loved him, even though she never had the courage to say it out loud.

Fifteen years later, in the other world (apparently the back door of Heaven), Billy is told that he can return to Earth for one day to make amends. Billy returns to find his daughter Louise emotionally scarred because she is constantly taunted over the fact that her father tried to commit a robbery. Billy, not telling her who he is, makes himself visible, tries to cheer her up, and gives her a star that he stole from Heaven. Louise refuses it, frightened, and Billy, in desperation, slaps her hand. She rushes inside the house and informs Julie of what happened, saying that she did not feel a slap, but a kiss. Billy tries to make himself invisible before Julie can see him, but she has glimpsed him for just a split second, and senses that he has come back for a reason. Billy asks his Heavenly Guide for permission to go to Louises high school graduation, and there he silently gives both her and Julie the confidence they need and the knowledge that, in spite of everything, he loved Julie.

==Film size==
The film was made in CinemaScope 55, and in color by DeLuxe. It was, however, ultimately shown in regular 35&nbsp;mm CinemaScope rather than the 55&nbsp;mm version of the process, although the original premiere did feature a 6-track magnetic stereo soundtrack specially devised for CinemaScope 55. It was played on a separate machine synchronized with the picture. All of the other prints of the film were composite prints, and used the standard 4-track stereo soundtrack featured on regular CinemaScope films circa 1953–1957.

==Differences from musical==
The film followed the stage musical faithfully, except for five major changes:

*In the film, Billy dies by accident, rather than by suicide as in the show – when he falls on his own knife while trying to escape arrest. In the show, he deliberately stabs himself while standing on the pile of crates, which does not collapse.
*The "recitative" singing in the "bench scene", leading directly into the song "If I Loved You", is turned into spoken dialogue.
*The "recitative" singing that leads directly into the song "June Is Bustin Out All Over" is eliminated.
*The film begins in 1888, with Billy having been dead for fifteen years, and the story of his life on Earth is made into a flashback that takes up three-quarters of the film. Billy tells his own story to the Starkeeper in order to receive permission to return to Earth for one day. This last change was made to safeguard against the movie audiences being surprised at the death of Billy, and to prevent them from leaving the movie theatre directly after it happens in case they thought the story ended at that point.
*In the film, there is no specific mention of the fact that Billy must return to Earth for one day and perform a good deed in order to win entry into Heaven, as there is in the play. In the films opening scene (a Cold open|pre-credits sequence), a Heavenly Friend advises Billy that "theres trouble...down on Earth", in case he should like to return there. Billy takes the friend up on the offer, but the film gives the impression that he is not doing it specifically to be admitted into Heaven.

A smaller, less important change was the switching of the song "When The Children Are Asleep" to a later moment in order to take full advantage of the Maine locale. In the film, it is sung in a new scene by Carrie and Mr. Snow in their boat as the couple, together with Julie and Billy, sail to the island for the clambake. (This would logically place the song between Acts I and II of the stage version.) In the stage version, the song is unheard by any of the other characters, but the film places it so that Julie and Billy are there to listen to the song, and to lend a sharp contrast to the happiness that Mr. Snow feels in comparison to Billys obvious uneasiness about the robbery that he and Jigger are soon to commit.

==The Frank Sinatra controversy== Frank Sinatra Capitol in the 1950s, and recorded it again in the 1960s for Reprise.

==Reception==
The world premiere of the film, held in New York, was attended by Washington diplomats as well as film stars. Among those in the audience were Averell Harriman and Edmund Muskie. Muskie was at that time the governor of Maine, where the story is set and where a large part of the movie was filmed.  Locations for the film include:
#Boothbay Harbor, Maine (scenes outside Netties Spa including the musical numbers "June is Bustin Out All Over", sung and danced directly outside the spa,  and "When The Children Are Asleep", sung in a moving sailboat on the way to the clambake; Billy and Jiggers discussion of the robbery, the robbery sequence -including the card game - and Billys death scene)
#Camden, Maine (the confrontation between Julie, Mrs. Mullin, Carrie, and Billy outside the amusement park)
#Newcastle and Augusta, Maine
#Paradise Cove, California (where Billy sings his "Soliloquy" and where some of "Louises Ballet" is danced), and
#The soundstages of Twentieth Century Fox studios.    In Boothbay, many of the scenes were filmed where the Carousel Marina now exists. 

The film received mostly good reviews, but sources differ as to its financial success.  Musical theatre scholar Thomas Hischak stated that the film "was a box office success across the country and 20th Century-Fox earned a considerable profit on the picture".   However, the review at allmovie.com states: "The films often downbeat tone ... did not resonate with 1950s audiences, making Carousel a surprising box-office flop."  Another analysis states that "The American release of Carousel actually lost money for Twentieth Century Fox, but Kine Weekly claimed that it was generally successful at the British box office." 
 State Fair, animated remake The King and I, also released in 1956,  and they did receive Academy Awards for that film, so they did not go home empty-handed on Oscar Night 1957.

Carousel was named #41 on Channel 4s (London) list of 100 Greatest Musicals. 

==Soundtrack album==
The soundtrack album was first issued on LP in 1956 by Capitol Records, but only in mono. However, because the films soundtrack had been recorded in then state-of-the-art stereo, as all Cinemascope films were back then, it was possible for Capitol to release a stereo LP of the album in 1958, after stereo records became a reality. The later release was shortened by about 5 minutes, by abridging the opening instrumental "Carousel Waltz" due to technical limitations imposed by the then-new format. The mono release, as originally issued, played for about fifty minutes, while the stereo one played for forty-five.

A large team of orchestrators lent their expertise to the complex musical arrangements recorded for the soundtrack: Nelson Riddle, Herbert W. Spencer, Earle Hagen, Edward B. Powell (responsible for "If I Loved You"), Bernard Mayer and Gus Levene.

Three editions of the soundtrack album were issued on compact disc, all in stereo. The first, issued in 1986 by Capitol, was an exact duplicate of the 1958 stereo LP. The rights then were obtained by Angel Records, which issued a second edition of the album, this time featuring the complete "Carousel Waltz" in stereo for the first time, along with all of the other songs included on the previous CD and LP incarnations.  This album was superseded in 2001 by Angels "expanded edition" of the soundtrack, which, for the first time, featured practically all of the songs and music recorded for the film, including the dance music, resulting in a playing time of 70 minutes, as opposed to the original 45 minute stereo LP and CD.

Under the vocal direction of Ken Darby, the songs and performers on the expanded edition of the album are:
# Introduction – Gordon MacRae/William Le Massena  (this is the opening pre-credits sequence, consisting of spoken dialogue)
# Main Title: The Carousel Waltz – 20th Century-Fox Orchestra/Alfred Newman  (About five minutes after the Main Title ends,  a slightly longer version of the Carousel Waltz is heard, this time during the scene showing Julie and Billys first meeting in the amusement park, but possibly to avoid repetition, this second playing of the waltz was not included in the soundtrack album. However, "Carousel Waltz" is heard again in the track "Louises Ballet".)
# Youre A Queer One, Julie Jordan – Barbara Ruick/Shirley Jones
# (When I Marry) Mr. Snow – Barbara Ruick
# If I Loved You – Shirley Jones/Gordon MacRae
# June Is Bustin Out All Over – Claramae Turner/Barbara Ruick and Chorus (leads without a pause into)
# June Is Bustin Out All Over Ballet – 20th Century-Fox Orchestra/Alfred Newman
# Soliloquy – Gordon MacRae
# Blow High, Blow Low – Cameron Mitchell and Mens Chorus
# When The Children Are Asleep – Robert Rounseville/Barbara Ruick
# A Real Nice Clambake – Barbara Ruick/Claramae Turner/Robert Rounseville/Cameron Mitchell and Chorus
# Stonecutters Cut It On Stone – Cameron Mitchell and Chorus
# Whats The Use Of Wondrin – Shirley Jones and Womens Chorus
# Youll Never Walk Alone – Shirley Jones/Claramae Turner
# Louises Ballet – 20th Century-Fox Orchestra/Alfred Newman
# If I Loved You (reprise) – Gordon MacRae
# Youll Never Walk Alone (Finale) – Shirley Jones and Chorus
# Carousel Waltz (LP Version) – 20th Century-Fox Orchestra/Alfred Newman (an additional track that contains the full eight-minute "Carousel Waltz").

==Deleted and cut songs==

Two songs recorded for the film, "Youre a Queer One, Julie Jordan" (sung by Barbara Ruick and Shirley Jones) and "Blow High, Blow Low" (sung by Cameron Mitchell and a male chorus) were eventually left out of the movie because the producers wanted to keep the length at 128 minutes.  They have, however, been included in all editions of the soundtrack album. "The Highest Judge of All", a song which precedes Billys meeting with the Starkeeper in the show, in which he asks to meet God, was eliminated from the film score and does not appear on the soundtrack album, presumably because the flashback scenes precluded it. Mr. Snows sentimental song, "Geraniums in the Winder", which serves as an introduction to "Stonecutters Cut It on Stone", was also eliminated, as was a reprise of "Mister Snow". As with "The Highest Judge", neither "Geraniums" nor the reprise of "Mister Snow" were ever recorded for the film, and have not appeared on any editions of the films soundtrack. One verse of "Stonecutters Cut It on Stone" (which appears on the album) was omitted from the film, perhaps because it contains a veiled reference to sex and the movie censors of the day might have objected.

The soundtrack album also featured (as noted above) the complete version of "Carousel Waltz" which is first heard at the beginning of the original show and early in the film. Because of its nearly eight-minute length, only an abridged version of the waltz was actually heard in the movie, and many stage productions of Carousel tend to shorten the piece as well, because of time considerations.  In addition, the soundtrack album version of the song "When the Children Are Asleep" includes the long introductory section to the song sung by Mr. Snow as it is in the show; the film does not use this. The soundtrack album also includes a section of "If I Loved You" not in the film. The lyric of this section, which is supposed to be sung by Billy Bigelow, is as follows:

:: Kind of scrawny and pale
:: Pickin at my food
:: And lovesick like any other guy.
:: Id throw away my sweater
:: And dress up like a dude
:: In a dickey and collar and a tie,
:: If I loved you.

This section leads to Billy reprising the refrain of the song. In the film, the refrain is still there, but the lines quoted above are omitted. Billy simply says "I wonder what itd be like", upon which Julie responds knowingly, "If you loved me? But you dont". Billy, in turn, answers, "No I dont", and goes on to sing the refrain of the song beginning with the lines
:: But somehow I can see
:: Just exactly how Id be.

==First telecast==
The film was first telecast on   for the first time on April 18, 2013, in letterbox format  and anamorphically enhanced in its proper aspect ratio for hi-def television sets.

==Remake==
Another Carousel film, produced by Hugh Jackman, who would star as Billy Bigelow, has been in pre-production for several years. Like the original, this remake would be distributed by 20th Century Fox.  As of May 2009, the script was reportedly finished.   Jackman mentioned that he would like to see Anne Hathaway considered for Julie Jordan.  No news has been announced about the proposed film since mid-2009. 
IMDB projected this films release for 2013, but the spare nature of the page provided little in the way of proof.
