 Big Baby, and List of Toy Story characters#Ken|Ken, with whom Barbie falls in love. They find out that that SunnySide Daycare beholds toys, from children over successive generations coming and being replaced for years. All of the toys choose to stay, except Woody, who attempts to return to Andy. Woody is found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside junior students. She takes Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play rough with Andys toys.

Later, Buzz asks Lotso to have them moved to the older childrens room, but is captured. Lotso, who controls Sunnyside ruthlessly at night when the teachers and students are not around, reveals he sends new toys to distract the toddlers to keep him and his henchmen safe, not caring whether the toys are broken in the process. Seeing promise in Buzz, he resets him to his original space ranger persona, resetting his memory. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mrs. Potato Head (who accidentally left one of her eyes at Andys house) sees Andy searching for the toys and convinces the toys that Woody told the truth. However, before they can leave, Andys toys are imprisoned by Lotsos gang.
 Chuckles that he, Lotso and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were accidentally left behind by Daisys family during a trip, they eventually returned to her house, only to find that Lotso had been replaced with a similar toy, causing Lotso to become embittered and cruel.

 

Woody returns to Sunnyside and reconciles with Andys other toys and begins planning a way out of Sunnyside. That night, the toys attempt to escape, and accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his original persona. Buzz allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are caught by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso. Lotso says that he now thinks toys are meant to be discarded, leading an enraged Big Baby to throw Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to run away, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. Woodys friends fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal persona.

Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, takes the toys to Bonnies house and introduces her to them. Bonnie recognizes Woody, who, to Andys surprise, is at the bottom of the box. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes him on to Bonnie, and then plays with her before leaving. Woody and the other toys watch Andys departure before beginning their new lives with Bonnie.

==Production==
According to the terms of Pixars initial seven-film deal with The Walt Disney Company|Disney, all characters created by Pixar for their films were owned by Disney.  Furthermore, Disney retained the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film,    though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels.  In 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Michael Eisner, Disney chairman at the time, put plans in motion to produce Toy Story 3 at a new Disney studio, Circle 7 Animation.    Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return, even if Pixar was not on board.  
 recalled Buzz Lightyears.]] Screenwriter Jim Herzfeld wrote a script for Circle 7s version of the film. It focused on the other toys shipping a malfunctioning Buzz to Taiwan, where he was built, believing that he will be fixed there. While searching on the Internet, they find out that many more Buzz Lightyear toys are malfunctioning around the world and the company has issued a massive Product recall|recall. Fearing Buzzs destruction, a group of Andys toys (Woody, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Jessie, and Bullseye) venture out to rescue Buzz. At the same time, Buzz meets other toys from around the world that were once loved, but have now been recalled. 
 Disney bought Robert Iger confirmed that Disney was in the process of transferring the production to Pixar.  John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich visited the house where they first pitched Toy Story and came up with the story for the film over a weekend. Stanton then wrote a film treatment|treatment.    On February 8, 2007, Catmull announced Toy Story 2 s co-director, Lee Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of John Lasseter (who was busy directing Cars 2), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter.  The release date was moved to 2010.  Unkrich said that he felt pressure to avoid creating "the first dud" for Pixar, since (as of 2010) all of Pixars films had been critical and commercial successes.

During the initial development stages of the film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch.  To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the films end, more than a year and a half was invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence. 

Instead of sending Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and John Ratzenberger scripts for their consideration in reprising their roles, a complete story reel of the film was shown to the actors in a theater. The reel was made up of moving storyboards with pre-recorded voices, sound effects, and music. At the conclusion of the preview, the actors signed on to the film.   

Dolby Laboratories announced that Toy Story 3 would be the first film that will feature theatrical 7.1 surround sound.    Thus, even the Blu-ray version will feature original 7.1 audio, unlike other films which were remixed into 7.1 for Blu-ray.

A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated, "This film—this whole three-part, 15-year epic—about the adventures of a bunch of silly plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love." 
Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A, saying, "Even with the bar raised high, Toy Story 3 enchanted and moved me so deeply I was flabbergasted that a digitally animated comedy about plastic playthings could have this effect."  Gleiberman also wrote in the next issue that he, along with many other grown men, cried at the end of the film.  Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a positive review, saying, "Woody, Buzz and playmates make a thoroughly engaging, emotionally satisfying return." 
 Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing that, "Compared with the riches of all kinds in recent Pixar masterworks such as Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up, Toy Story 3 looks and plays like an exceptionally slick and confident product, as opposed to a magical blend of commerce and popular art."  Orlando Sentinel film critic Roger Moore, who gave the film 3½ out of 4 stars, wrote, "Dazzling, scary and sentimental, Toy Story 3 is a dark and emotional conclusion to the film series that made Pixar famous."

==Fourth film==
 
Lee Unkrich initially stated that a fourth Toy Story film was not being planned. "Well, we dont have any plans for Toy Story 4," Unkrich said. "Im flattered that people ask about it—it reminds me how much people love the characters, but it was really important to me with this film that we not just create another sequel, that it not just be another appendage coming off of the other two."  Unkrich went on to say, "there may be opportunities for Woody and Buzz in the future, but we dont have any plans for anything right now."  It has also been reported that Hanks and Allen have signed on for fourth Toy Story film if Pixar ever decides to produce one.    In a BBC interview in 2011, Hanks said that he thought Pixar was working on a sequel.  Disney denied the rumors saying, "nothing is official." 
 Jim Morris stated that this film will not be a continuation of the third film but will instead be a stand-alone sequel.
