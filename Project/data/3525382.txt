 George Wallace as Cody, Aline Towne as his sidekick Joan Gilbert, and serial veteran Roy Barcroft as the evil Retik, the Ruler of the Moon.  The director was Fred C. Brannon, with a screenplay by Ronald Davidson, and special effects by the Lydecker brothers. This serial recycles the flying sequences from Republics earlier 1949 serial King of the Rocket Men. It was later released by Republic in 1966 as the 100-minute television film Retik the Moon Menace.
 ABC TV Space Patrol (1950–1955). There is, however, no surviving evidence that this was a consideration by anyone at Republic.   

==Plot==
 
Commando Cody (George Wallace) is a civilian researcher and inventor with a number of employees. He uses a streamlined helmet and a sonic-powered rocket backpack attached to a leather flying jacket. Cody also uses a rocket ship capable of reaching the Moon. When the U. S. finds itself under attack from a mysterious force that can wipe out entire military bases and industrial complexes, Cody surmises (correctly) that the Earth is coming under attack from our own Moon. He then flies his rocket ship there and confronts the Moons dictator, Retik (Roy Barcroft), who boldly announces his plans to both conquer Earth and then move the Moons entire population here using spaceships. 

On Earth, Cody battles an elusive lunar warrior named Krog (Peter Brocco) and his gang of human henchmen, hired to steal and stockpile various supplies for the coming invasion.

 George Wallace. rear projection screen for the in-studio shot flying sequences. Wallace performed his own stunt flying take-offs by jumping onto a springboard that would send him up and over the camera rig set-up.  

This serial is heavily padded with footage first filmed for the earlier King of the Rocket Men, to which this was a pseudo-sequel. A repainted Juggernaut vehicle from the much earlier Undersea Kingdom serial is also reused here as Retiks lunar tank.  Radar Men from the Moon shows outer space as brightly lit and the characters walking on the Moon in normal Earth gravity and daylight without pressure suits. His laboratory building is actually a Republic Pictures office building with a prop "Cody Laboratories" sign. 

Two different aerodynamic helmets were used with the Commando Cody rocket backpack, with the lighter weight version being used only in the stunt sequences; the single-hinged visors of both helmets were always getting stuck open or closed. 

==Release==
===Theatrical===
Radar Men from the Moons official release date is January 9, 1952, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to U. S. film exchanges. 

This was followed by a re-release of Perils of Nyoka, re-titled as Nyoka and the Tigermen, instead of a new serial. Republics next new serial, Zombies of the Stratosphere, which also used the Cody flying suit and related stock effects footage seen here, followed in the summer. 

This serial was re-released on September 30, 1957 between Republics re-releases of the similar Zorros Black Whip and Son of Zorro. Previously, the final original Republic serial was King of the Carnival released two years earlier in 1955. 

===Television===
 
Radar Men from the Moon was one of twenty-six Republic serials re-released on television in 1966 as 100 minute TV films under their Century 66 project; the title was changed to Retik the Moon Menace. 
In 1979 Firesign Theatre used segments of this and other serials in their made-for-TV parody comedy movie, J-Men Forever.   

===Mystery Science Theater 3000===
In 1989 the serial regained notoriety as the first shorts shown by the cult series Mystery Science Theater 3000. The first eight-and-a-half chapters of this Commando Cody serial were lampooned before their main feature-of-the-week (only half of the ninth installment was shown, with the in-show excuse being "the film broke").

==Critical reception==
William C. Cline dismisses this serial as just a "quickie" in his 1984 book In the Nick of Time.  

==Copyright==
Because of a failure to renew copyright, Radar Men lapsed into the Public Domain in 1979.
