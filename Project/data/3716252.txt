The DVDs title is derived from the song "This Disaster" off the bands fourth album, Catalyst (2004). It is most likely that the title was chosen, because in the middle of the bands set the main power to the venue went out.

===Live at the Forum, London, England===
What makes this show so unique is that during the show while the band was playing "Dressed to Kill", the main power to the venue went out. As a result, the band could not continue their performance. However, in an effort to keep the show going, the band played two acoustic songs while the power was being restored, namely "My Friends over You" and "I Dont Wanna Know". After finishing the song, the power was restored and the band continued their set as planned, including full band versions of both songs.
