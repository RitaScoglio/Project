Elstree Calling (1930) is a film directed by Andre Charlot, Jack Hulbert, Paul Murray, and Alfred Hitchcock at Elstree Studios.

==Synopsis== vignettes linked Shakespearean actor and technical problems with a viewers TV set. 

Hitchcocks contribution was the comic linking segments about a man trying to "tune in" the revue on his television set, but always failing to get the picture for long because of his needless tinkering. (In the UK, John Logie Bairds work in mechanical television in the 1920s made television a topical subject at the time.) 

==Production background==
Imitating the lavish use of Technicolor by Hollywood studios at that time, two sequences in the film were artificially coloured by the Path√©color process, which used stencils to tint selected areas of the black-and-white prints.

In their book Films musical moment, Ian Conrich and Estella Tincknell write:
:"The British equivalent of Hollywoods all-star revues was Elstree Calling (1930), produced by   (then contracted to BIP) was one of several directors employed on the production; and the film is quite possibly the first ever to refer directly to television (the linking narrative concerns a television broadcast of the revue, some six years before the BBC began regular television transmissions)."
