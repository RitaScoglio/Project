==Plot==
Edward "The Torch" Garrotte (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a serial killer who has a penchant for killing women and setting them on fire. All of his victims are also mothers. Detective Jake Riley (Michael Rooker) is a Seattle police detective who has spent three years chasing Garrotte. Just days before Jakes retirement Garrotte strikes again, but Jake is off the case. During his retirement party, Jake receives a call from Garrotte, who threatens to go after his friends and family. Realizing Garrotte needs to be stopped no matter what, Riley sets out to stop him.

A secret government agency hires Jake as a consultant on a special project. They have cloned Garrotte from DNA evidence found at a crime scene. They need Jakes help to train this replicant, who has genetic memories from Garrotte and a telepathic link to him. The replicant has the body of a 40 year old but the mind of a child. Jakes job is to help the Replicant track Garrotte down by using the memories stored in Garrottes DNA.

The Replicant and Jake begin to hunt Garrotte. Jake believes the Replicant could turn on him at any time, as Garrottes killer instinct may take over. The Replicant tries to understand the world, and his connection with Garrotte. The replicant does not understand why Jake treats him so roughly, since the Replicant views Jake as family.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes, review aggregator, reports that 27% of eleven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.3/10.   Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said, "Its far from a great film, but Replicant is quite possibly the best film Van Damme has starred in since his debut in Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport. Fans of the genre should at least give it a rental."   Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide stated that the "action sequences are well (rehearsed)" and that credit should be given where it is due. She went on to say that the (then) 40 year-old martial artist "still has the physical goods, executing 180 splits and gymnastic stunts with the grace and apparent ease of someone much younger".  Earl Cressey of DVD Talk also praised the actions sequences and called Replicant "a decent sci-fi" film that is "always engaging and has some great action scenes that fans of Van Damme will certainly enjoy."
