"Dr. Fejos has handled his scenes with no small degree of imagination. Mr. Veidts clever acting and Mary Philbins captivating charm, this picture holds ones attention. Moreover, the narrative is developed with a certain force and skill. While some of the straight camera work is not up to scratch, there are a number of photographic feats that are quite effective. It is a picture that looks older than it really is, especially in the tinted portions where one goes from an amber interior scene to an azure blue night in the open."
 

==Synopsis==

A young thief, Mark Royce (played by Fred MacKaye) is caught stealing from Eriks apartment and is taken in at Julies suggestion. Secretly she falls in love with the new apprentice.
