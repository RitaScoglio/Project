 David McKenna and directed by Michael Cristofer. Released in October 1999, Body Shots tells the story of eight singles whose night of drunken debauchery goes terribly wrong. One DVD version in the UK contains a highly misleading blurb suggesting that it is some sort of sexual comedy. In fact the film is an insightful exploration of a night that ends in an alleged rape, with parallel versions intercut with flashbacks and comments to camera from the various characters who all have different attitudes to sex. While leaving the plot open (the final outcome is a hung jury) the script tilts towards the version of the accused macho actor and against the binge drinking and disturbed accuser. Perhaps this is why establishment critics gave it such a panning.
