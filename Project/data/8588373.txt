 South Asian September 11th attacks through the story of Baldev Singh, an Indian immigrant in New York who, facing harassment in his workplace, takes his boss hostage with a toy gun.     

== Critical response == Hindi film in the United States.  One New Jersey film critic likened it to a South Asian version of Do The Right Thing. Producer Ramzan Lakhani described his motivation behind the film in an interview with a local New Jersey newspaper, stating that while second generation South Asian youth were producing many films in the United States, he hoped to target the immigrant first generation, and hence tried to tailor the film to Indian sensibilities, including Bollywood-style dance numbers and the use of Hindi.
