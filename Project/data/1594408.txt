Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie serves as a bridge between the Power Rangers Zeo and Power Rangers Turbo television seasons, with the new cast and characters from the film becoming cast members of the television series. As with its television season, the film used concepts and costumes from the Japanese Super Sentai Series Gekisou Sentai Carranger. Sets and costumes created for original characters in the film were later used in the television series, with the films climactic antagonist Maligore being reused for the evil Dark Specter in the subsequent Power Rangers in Space season.

 Adam and Tommy are Kat and Tanya arrive Elgar as sacrifices for Maligore and he has their minds scrambled. As they need to be pure of heart, Divatox rejects them before finding two perfect specimens who are scuba diving nearby and she has them captured.

While recovering, Lerigot receives a telepathic transmission from his mate Yara, and Divatox threatens her and their baby Batel harm if the Rangers interfere with her plans and demands that Lerigot surrender himself to her. She also offers the two humans, revealed to be their old friends   powers and their new vehicular zords, they drive across the desert in order to board a ship called the Ghost Galleon, to make their way across the ocean. They are unexpectedly joined by Justin, who has received Rockys Blue Turbo Ranger powers in order to help them.

Meanwhile, Jason and Kim come up with a plan to open the submarines bilge to escape with Bulk and Skull, and the ship crosses the barrier. They open the hatch and Bulk, Skull and Kimberly escape, but Jason is trapped and remains behind as a sacrifice to Maligore. After they land on the island, they find that Kimberly had been captured by the Malicians; inhabitants of the island, and she is recaptured. The Rangers narrowly avoid being destroyed by Divatoxs torpedoes and morph in order to scout the island, eventually coming across Maligores temple, where Divatox and her followers are. Despite their best efforts, Jason and Kimberly are sacrificed to Maligore and are filled with evil, they attack their friends mercilessly but when Lerigot and Yara are freed, they manage to purify them once more.

The movie features a cameo appearance by Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, where Rita is called by Divatox in hopes of advice to use against the Rangers. The characters would eventually come face to face with each other in Power Rangers in Spaces premiere episode for the first and only time.

==Production==
Filming was done in Hawaii, California, Florida, and Tennessee. As opposed to the storyline and CGI Megazord used in the first Power Rangers movie, this film is canon and utilizes the actual costume of the Turbo Megazord, appearing in American footage (the main series would rely on the Carranger footage). According to a 2013 post on Boschs Facebook page, the original script called for a lengthy underwater battle using the Zeo Ranger powers, wherein the Power Rangers emerge with tattered costumes. While this plot element was ultimately dropped from the theatrical release, the concept of torn outfits would be used for the Turbo season finale. Also, whereas Hilary Shepard Turner appears as Divatox in the film, by the time filming began for the TV series, she had taken pregnancy leave, thus being replaced by Carol Hoyt; shortly after the episode in which the four veteran Rangers resign and transfer their powers to a new team (filmed after a hiatus of several months), Shepard resumed the role of Divatox, continuing through In Space.

==Reception==

Kevin Thomas wrote a positive review in the The Los Angeles Times saying the filmmakers have brought much panache and sophistication to the making of this fantasy adventure extolling the good old-fashioned virtues of spirit and courage embodied by the Power Rangers and that Turbo is a solid follow-up.
