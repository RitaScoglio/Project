Tarzans Greatest Adventure is a 1959 adventure film directed by John Guillermin, produced by Sy Weintraub and Harvey Hayutin, and written by Les Crutchfield, based on the character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. With a strong supporting cast that included Anthony Quayle and Sean Connery, and a focus on action and suspense, the movie won critical praise as a Tarzan film that appealed to adults as well as children.

The film features a literate Tarzan portrayed by Gordon Scott. The character of Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane, Tarzans wife, does not appear and is not mentioned. At one point, Tarzan briefly romances a female character, suggesting that he is a loner, not a family man. Cheeta, Tarzans chimp companion in many movies, appears only a few times near the start of the film, and the kind of comic relief that Cheeta represents is generally absent from the movie.

==Plot==

A native village is robbed, supposedly by natives. Before a man dies, he mentions the name "Slade". Black colouring is found on his hand so they know it is white people who did it, disguised as Africans. Tarzan arrives, remembering Slade from a year previously as a man who let three of his men die during a hunt for a rogue elephant and has a grudge against him. A woman (Angie) turns up, Sanchez latest woman, flying one of his planes. Later she buzzes Tarzan in his canoe, and crashes the plane so now Tarzan is stuck with her as he goes after Slade. Slade has 3 men and a girlfriend with him. He knows where a diamond mine is and has got his supplies for his trip by stealing them. Tensions run high amongst his men. Kruger is an ex-Nazi and a diamond expert. OBannion is an Irish rebel, a drunk and a trouble maker who keeps hassling Dino till Dino decides to kill him but falls foul of a wild animal and quicksand.

Tarzan and Angie lose their canoe but take an overland short cut where he fells some trees into the water to stop Slades boat. Tarzan attacks them with arrows but they respond with (stolen) dynamite and Tarzan is injured. He later kills OBannion but collapses, needing Angies help. Angie is captured trying to get penicillin for Tarzan and the group continue in their boat. Tarzan recovers and follows them to the diamond mine. Toni (Slades girlfriend) falls into a trap meant for Tarzan. In the cave, Kruger realizes that Slade is more interested in danger than diamonds and tries to kill him but is in turn killed. Slade then goes out to wait for Tarzan with his prepared weapon, a metal noose for garrotting him. There is a final fight between the two on a cliff top.

==Production notes==

This film portrayed a grittier, more realistic Tarzan who could be as savage as his opponents but could also speak eloquently and politely to a woman (Sara Shane) who gets involved in the plot (he also makes love to her in the jungle at one point, without making any reference to Jane). A fair bit of library film of animals was used.
 Mike Henry as Tarzan. Considered one of the best of the Tarzan films by many.
