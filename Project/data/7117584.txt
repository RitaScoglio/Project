Bruce Lee: A Dragon Story ( ; also known as The Bruce Lee Story, Bruce Lee: Super Dragon and Superdragon) is a heavily fictionalized  ), and quite possible the first film in the odd Bruceploitation subgenre.

==Synopsis==

The film opens with a pre-fame Bruce Lee (Bruce Li) delivering newspapers in Seattle, Washington.  (However, he is seen distributing copies of a Washington D.C. newspaper).  We then see Lee competing in various martial arts tournaments and eventually landing a role on the television show The Green Hornet.  He also gets married, and has to fight a whole lot of challengers.
 Golden Harvest.

Lee also meets and falls in love with actress Betty Ting-Pei, who announces that she is pregnant with his love child (the films most radical departure from the facts of Lees life).  The soap opera-style romance takes over the film in its second half, and at one point there is a love triangle between Lee, Betty Ting-Pei, and one of Lees co-stars (almost certainly based on Nora Miao).

==Criticism==

Bruce Lee: A Dragon Story is almost universally considered one of Bruce Lis worst movies.  Many have lambasted the film for its tendency to stray heavily from the facts of Lees life, for the poor pacing, the lack of frequent fight scenes, and the soapy love story
Bruce Li himself has also spoken about his dislike for this and his other early films. "After my first movie, the films would be crafted around the life and times of Bruce Lee. However I would like to make an important point, I did not like these films. Without my knowledge or consent the producers changed my name to Li Hsiao Lung."
