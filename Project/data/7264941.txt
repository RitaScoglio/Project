==Plot summary== censor (Radford).

As London burns in the Blitz, and the newspaper struggles to stay in business, he writes several more eye-witness stories, and then learns of People For Peace, a pacifist organisation. He suspects the members of being Nazi tools and investigates the group. Together with a fellow journalist, Carole Bennett (Hobson), he finds that his suspicions are correct and that it has already been penetrated by security officers.

But when one of the members changes his views and approaches Bennett with a tell-all story, she is kidnapped by the leaders of the group. In a raid by police and security officers, she is freed,  but Randall is wounded in a shoot-out.

They have their story,  but the security officer in charge makes it clear that the incident must remain unpublished â€“ it never happened.
