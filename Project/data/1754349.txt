 The Ambassador Hotel. Karole Armitage was the choreographer. 
It was released on VHS video cassette in 1990 and became a cult classic, prompting it to be re-released (again on VHS) in 2000 as part of the "MGM Avant-Garde Cinema" collection. It was not a commercial success, but it was highly praised by critics for its caustic commentary on American values and celebrity culture. It was released on DVD on August 23, 2005.

The film, which was directed by John Boskovich, recreates moments from the stage show, often with Bernhard dressed in zany costumes reminiscent of the character she is embodying without actually "becoming" that character. Interspersed are faux-interview bits with actress Lu Leonard as Bernhards manager and actor Steve Antin, with whom she would later co-star in the film Inside Monkey Zetterland. The film is notorious for a finale in which Bernhard wears nothing but pasties and an extremely skimpy g-string (in an American Flag print,) and proceeds to go-go dance to the song "Little Red Corvette" by Prince (artist)|Prince.
