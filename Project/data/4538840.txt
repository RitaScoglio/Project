==Plot== screen names screwdrivers and asks him to take photographs of her. While trying to take photographs, Jeff gets dizzy and his vision blurs; he falls to the floor and passes out.

When Jeff regains consciousness, his wrists and ankles are bound to a chair. Hayley explains that she has been tracking him and that she drugged him because she knows he is a pedophile, child rapist and murderer. Jeff denies these allegations claiming that he had innocent intentions. Hayley searches Jeffs house for evidence of sexually deviant crime. She finds Jeffs gun and discovers his safe. In the safe, Hayley finds "sick" pictures and a photo of Donna Mauer, a local girl who had been kidnapped and remains missing. Jeff denies involvement in Mauers disappearance and succeeds in reaching his gun, but when he (still bound to the chair) attacks Hayley, she renders him unconscious by asphyxiating him with plastic wrap.

When Jeff wakes, he finds himself bound to a steel table with a plastic bag of ice on his genitals. Hayley explains that she has implemented and will perform Jeffs castration. In an effort to dissuade Hayley from hurting him, Jeff uses threats, an attempt at a bribe, other negotiations, and in a final, desperate plea for sympathy, he tells her his own story of abuse. Following the operation, Hayley leaves the kitchen, claiming that she goes to take a shower. Jeff struggles and frees himself. When he reluctantly checks the site of the operation, he realizes he is actually unharmed, and Hayley has elaborately faked his castration. He storms off in a rage to get Hayley in the bathroom where the shower is running. Scalpel in hand, he attacks, only to find the shower empty. Hayley counterattacks him from behind and as they struggle, Hayley incapacitates him with a stun gun.

Hayley poses as a police officer and asks Jeffs ex-girlfriend, Janelle, to come immediately to Jeffs house. Jeff regains consciousness to find that Hayley has bound his wrists and hoisted him to stand on a chair in his kitchen with a noose around his neck.  Hayley makes Jeff an offer: if he commits suicide, she promises to erase the evidence of his crimes, but if he refuses, she promises to expose his secrets. The conversation is interrupted when a neighbor knocks on the front door, selling Girl Scout cookies. Hayley tells the neighbor that she is Jeffs niece; the neighbor leaves shortly afterwards. When Hayley returns, Jeff breaks free from his bindings and pursues her, eventually finding her on the roof of his house, where she has lured him. Hayley has brought her rope from the kitchen and fashioned it into a noose secured to the chimney. Hayley keeps Jeff at bay with his own gun.

Jeff finally confesses that he was involved in Donna Mauers sexual assault and murder. He insists that he only watched while another man actually committed the crime. Jeff promises Hayley that, if she spares his life, he will tell her the other mans name so she can exact her revenge. Hayley confesses that she knows his name and says, "Aaron told me you did it before he killed himself." Janelle arrives, and Hayley once again urges Jeff to hang himself. While Janelle calls aloud for Jeff, Jeff lets Hayley slide the noose around his neck. Jeff takes the last fatal step off his roof with the noose around his neck, and the rope is seen to go taut. Hayley reveals to the dying Jeff that she will not hold up her end of the deal they agreed upon and will not hide the evidence of his past crimes. She then gathers her belongings and escapes through the woods unnoticed. The film ends with Hayley walking down the road in her red hoodie.

Very little   in his own game." 
 digital colorist for the film, and is one of the few instances where a colorist received a spot in the opening credits.    The film contains many coloring effects and "density shifts" of lighting to reflect the moods of the characters. For example, when Hayley gets angry, the colors would be edited to be of lower frequency.  One effect used which, as far as the director is aware of, had not been done in cinema before, was to brighten the lighting in filming and correct everything down in post-production.  This allowed for facial details to be visible even while having a darkened atmosphere.  According to the DVD extras, the process required a custom-built digital intermediate to be made and proved to be extremely difficult, with corrections having to be made frame-by-frame in some instances. This technique, known as ETTR, is a standard procedure in digital photography and cinematography to minimize the amount of noise in shadows and midtones. Early working titles of the script were Vendetta and Snip Snip.  The producer wanted a title with a "sugar and spice combination and a mixture of harsh roughness, innocence, and vulnerability", and settled on the title Hard Candy.

==Reception==
The film  has a 68% positive rating at   based on 30 reviews. 

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 and a half stars out of four and wrote that "There is undeniable fascination in the situation as it unfolds... Seen as a film, seen as acting and direction, seen as just exactly how it unfolds on the screen, Hard Candy is impressive and effective."  Steve Persall wrote in the Tampa Bay Times he saw the movie in a crowded bar, yet "until the shocking end, theres nothing less than rapt attention to this sordid thriller about an online predator (Wilson) and his not-so-innocent prey (Ellen Page). On a party night in New Orleans? Thats how creepy-good this movie is."  Steve Schneider, writing in the Orlando Weekly, praised the films "grabber of a sicko setup... Its a memorably tense pas de deux, and if the movie doesnt pay off on it properly, fault a script that ventures further and further into psychological-thriller claptrap, leaving the two stars to rely on their hefty talents to keep it at all believable."

Pages performance was received well by critics; Lynn Hirschberg of The New York Times Magazine said "a star was born, but almost no one noticed", describing Hard Candy as Pages initial artistic breakthrough performance, and her role in the 2007 film Juno (film)|Juno as her mainstream popularity breakthrough performance.  Claudia Puig from USA Today praised her for "remain  consistently convincing" to her role which is both "powerful and chilling ... She manages to be both cruelly callous and likable, and hers is one of the most complex, disturbing and haunting performances of the year."
