==Reaction==
The film received mostly positive reviews. Critic Roger Ebert notes of Nolte: "it is clear that he was born to play Bob. It is one of those performances that flows unhindered from an actors deepest instincts." 

Reviewer Pam Grady, writing for Reel.com, also praised the film: "The Good Thief has many virtues, beginning with the sheer wit of Jordans screenplay and Chris Mengess neon-saturated cinematography that renders Nice both beautiful and sinister, trapping the characters in the glare of its lights. The heist itself is a complicated affair — Jordan took Melvilles original idea and added a distinctly 21st-century twist — and all the more satisfying for it." 

The film holds a 77% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus "Bolstered by Noltes strong performance, The Good Thief brims with seductive style."
