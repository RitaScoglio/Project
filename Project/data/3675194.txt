== Plot ==
Omkara Shukla or Omi (Ajay Devgan) is a bahubali, a sort of political Criminal|enforcer. He is the leader of a gang which commits political crimes for the local politician Tiwari Bhaisaab (Naseeruddin Shah). Ishwar Langda Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan) and Keshav Kesu Firangi Upadhyay (Vivek Oberoi) are his closest lieutenants.

The movie starts with Langda Tyagi gate-crashing a baraat and challenging Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), the bridegroom, to try and stop Omkara from abducting the bride, Dolly Mishra (Kareena Kapoor). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place.

Dolly’s father Advocate Raghunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as vakeel saab (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omi’s head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Raghunath grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring an end to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi and was not abducted. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed. The director here references one of the most significant lines of the play Othello, with Dollys father repeating the couplet almost verbatim, albeit in translation. The original lines read, "Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father and may thee."
 MMS sex parliament and state elections. Omkara appoints Kesu over Langda as his successor once he enters politics himself. Langda, disappointed with Omkaras poor judgment and jealous of Kesu, his younger, less-experienced, superior, hatches a plot to avenge both his offenders. He first causes a violent brawl between Kesu and Rajju by taking advantage of Kesus low threshold for alcohol. Such irresponsible behaviour by Kesu infuriates Omi, who now starts having doubts over his decision.
 

On the one hand, playing the role of a concerned friend, Langda convinces Kesu to appeal to Dolly, Omis lover and bride-to-be, to mollify Omi. On the other hand, he starts to disrepute Dolly by implicating Kesus visits to her as an illicit affair between the two. A kamarbandh carelessly dropped by Dolly and stolen by Langda’s wife Indu (Konkona Sen Sharma), which eventually reaches Billo Chamanbahar (Bipasha Basu) as a gift from Kesu, plays an important part in the plot, as evidence of Dolly’s infidelity.
 shoots Kesu with a silent approval from Omi. Kesu is hit with a bullet on his arm. Hearing gunshots and in shock, Indu enters the room where Omi is sitting next to Dolly’s corpse in remorse. Indu notices the kamarbandh and confesses to stealing it; they both understand the fatal misunderstanding with Langda as its root cause.

In retribution, Indu slashes Langdas throat and Omi commits suicide. The movie closes with Omi lying dead on the floor and Dolly’s dead body swinging above him, while Kesu looks on.

=== Character outlines ===
* Omkara "Omi" Shukla&nbsp;— Omkara is a hardened  , equivalent to a caporegime|capo, a man with principles who sees life in extremes, either as good or evil. He is the illegitimate child of a higher caste Brahmin man and a lower caste woman.
* Dolly Mishra&nbsp;— Dolly is a playful, innocent, young woman, smitten by Omi. She is the one who expresses her love for him and lays the basis of their relationship. Throughout the narrative, other characters are shown to doubt her innocence, including her father. Omi finds her personality ambiguous, resulting in the tragic end.
* Ishwar "Langda" Tyagi&nbsp;— Langda (which means limp in Hindi) is the catalyst in the story. He had been a loyal right-hand man to Omi for years and expected to be the next bahubali. Kesu’s promotion gives a crushing blow to his ambitions and brings out the evil in him. His jealousy and hatred towards his kin is further encouraged by chiding remarks from Rajju.
* Keshav "Kesu Firangi" Upadhyay&nbsp;— Kesu is Omi’s other deputy. His epithet comes from his knowledge of English. He is college-educated and urban culture|urban, known to be somewhat of a casanova. He is important to Omi for his political contacts in the students. After admitting to having "known" a string of women, he falls in love with Billo and proposes marriage. He is shown to be impatient and easily frustrated with a low threshold for alcohol.
* Billo Chamanbahar&nbsp;— Billo is a singer/dancer who melts hearts with just her looks. She sees Kesu as a future companion, though keeps him hanging on. She makes an easy tool for Langda to manipulate.
* Indu&nbsp;— Indu leads a   life as Langda Tyagi’s wife. She becomes an unwitting aid in her husbands plan.
*Rajan "Rajju" Tiwari&nbsp;— Son of a respectable Thakur (Indian title)|thekedar, he is head-over-heels in love with Dolly. He tries to win her affection throughout the movie.
* Bhaisaab&nbsp;— Bhaisaab is an influential and powerful politician that many characters defer to. He is an outwardly sophisticated man, with a ruthless interior. He is a politician to the bone and rules the region with an iron fist, picking up enemies as he progresses his career. He is a father figure for Omkara as well as the political head honcho.

====Supporting cast====
* Pankaj Tripathi           as      Kichlu
* Manav Kaushik		as	Surendra Kaptaan
* Kamal Tiwari		as	Advocate Raghunath Mishra

== Shooting location ==
Omkara was shot over a period of 4 months across various locales, including Lonavala, Lucknow University, Allahabad, Satara Mahabaleshwar, Mumbai and Wai, Maharashtra, where bulk of the shooting took place. Even though most of the shooting took place in Maharashtra, sets were erected with precise details to create an authentic Uttar Pradesh village.

== Production ==
Members of the production team included stunt co-ordinator Jai Singh, costume designer Dolly Ahluwalia, choreographers Bhushan Lakhandri and Ganesh Acharya along with chief assistant director Ajit Ahuja.

The title of the film was decided by a popular vote. Moviegoers had a choice among Omkara, Issak and O Saathi Re, all of which had already appeared as the films song titles.

== Reception ==
Omkara had a fairly good performance at the box office in India and earned praises all over. The movie grossed $16,466,144 world wide in its total run at the box office. Even though the movie received rave reviews, the dark theme and strong language kept away family audiences.  It was, however, a grand success abroad. The film quickly entered the UKs Top Ten and did very well in Australia, South Africa and the United States. Omkara was praised for its taut script, brilliantly executed dramatic sequences and its lead performances. Kareena Kapoors and Ajay Devgans performance was considered to be the finest of their films. Director Vishal Bhardwaj says it was Aamir Khan who was keen to star in the role of Langda Tyagi initially, but finally it was Saif Ali Khan who played it and drew the most praise for this villainous role, along with Konkana Sen who eventually won a National Award for her performance.   

== Language == A Certificate censor board of India. Critics and audiences were divided in their opinions about the foul language. Many believed that it was not required and would lead to distancing the movie from the family audience,  while on the other hand some applauded it for authentically showing the rustic setting of the story. The language and A certificate narrowed the audience but in turn brought accolades for the creators of the movie for valuing creativity over commercial success.
