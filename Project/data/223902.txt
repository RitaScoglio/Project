==Plot==
The film begins with the disappearance of Pennsylvania executive Tom Gruneman (played by Robert Milli). The police reveal that an obscene letter was found in Grunemans office, addressed to a prostitute in New York City named Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda), who had received several similar letters from him. After six months of fruitless police work, Peter Cable (Charles Cioffi), an executive at Grunemans company, hires family friend and detective John Klute (Donald Sutherland) to investigate Grunemans disappearance.

They find Page, who tells them the customer was not Gruneman but an "older man... fatter, balder." Pages body then turns up in the Kill Van Kull. Klute deduces a connection between the two "suicides" of the prostitutes, surmising that the client probably also killed Gruneman and may kill Daniels next. He revisits Grunemans contacts to find connections with the case. By typographic comparison, the supposed obscene letters of Gruneman are traced to Cable, with whom Klute has been meeting regularly to report on his investigation.

Now having a suspect, Klute asks Cable for an additional $500 to buy the "black book" of the first prostitute who apparently committed suicide, telling Cable he is certain the book will reveal the identity of the abusive client. This flushes out Cable, who corners Bree and reveals that he sent her the letters, explaining that Gruneman had interrupted him when he was attacking a prostitute. Certain that Gruneman would use the incident as leverage against him within the company, Cable attempted to frame Gruneman by planting the letter in his office. He confesses to the killings. After playing an audiotape he made as he murdered Page, he attacks Daniels. Klute rushes in, and Cable jumps or is thrown out a window to his death (the film uses ambiguous editing). 

Daniels moves out of her apartment with Klutes help, though Daniels voiceover with her psychiatrist reveals her fear of domestic life and a likelihood that the doctor will "see me next week."
