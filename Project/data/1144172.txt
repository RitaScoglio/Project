==Plot== wine aficionado soap but now does commercial voice-overs and plans to enter his future father-in-laws successful real estate business after hes married. Miles wants to spend the week relaxing, golfing, enjoying good food and wine; however, much to Miles consternation, Jack is on the prowl and wants one last sexual fling, before settling into domestic life.

In the wine country, the pair visit Miles favorite restaurant, The Hitching Post II and meet Maya, an attractive waitress with whom Miles is casually acquainted. Jack senses that Maya is interested in Miles, who downplays his friends intuition, and tells Jack that Maya is married. He tells Maya that Miles manuscript has been accepted for publication, even though it is only being considered. Later, at a tasting in a local winery, they meet a pourer named Stephanie, who is also acquainted with Maya. Jack is immediately attracted to Stephanie and arranges a double date, to include Miles and Maya, and tells Miles that he learned Maya is no longer married ("sans rock", as he describes it). During the date, Miles gets drunk and telephones Vicki his ex-wife, after learning from Jack earlier that day that she has remarried. They return to Stephanies home where Jack and Stephanie immediately adjourn to her bedroom, while Miles and Maya connect through their mutual interest in wine. Miles gives Maya a copy of his manuscript. As the week progresses, Jacks affair with Stephanie continues, to the point where he believes hes falling in love with her, he bonds with her daughter and makes the suggestion to Miles, that they move there for him to be closer to Stephanie. After spending the day together, Miles and Maya return to her apartment and have sex. The next day, Miles lets it slip that Jack is to be married. Disgusted with the dishonesty, Maya dumps Miles and tells Stephanie who, in a fit of jealous rage, breaks Jacks nose using her motorcycle helmet.
 spit bucket. That night, with Stephanie gone, Jack hooks up with another waitress named Cammi, who recognized him from his acting career. Hours later, Jack shows up back at the motel room he shares with Miles&nbsp;– naked and confessing that Cammis husband came home early while she and Jack were having sex. Jack explains he was forced to flee without his clothes and wallet (which contains the irreplaceable wedding rings). Jack convinces Miles to drive him back to Cammis house and sneak inside, where he discovers Cammi and her husband making love. Miles spies Jacks wallet, grabs it and runs from the house, barely escaping Cammis husband, pursuing him in the nude. To explain the broken nose to his fiancée, Jack runs Miles convertible into a tree, giving the appearance they had been in an accident.

At the wedding, Miles runs into his ex-wife Vicki and meets her new husband. After learning that she is also pregnant, Miles faces the fact that Vicki will never return to him. Alone, he drinks his prized wine, a 1961 Château Cheval Blanc, from a disposable coffee cup at a fast-food restaurant and falls into an even deeper depression. Later, he receives a message from Maya, who says she enjoyed his manuscript and invites him to visit. The last scene in the movie shows Miles back in Santa Ynez, knocking on Mayas door.

==Impact on wine industry==
Throughout the film, Miles speaks fondly of the red wine varietal Pinot noir, while denigrating Merlot. {{cite news

The original soundtrack album features 15 jazz instrumentals composed and produced by Rolfe Kent and was orchestrated and arranged for the band by Tony Blondal. The album was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for "Best Original Score", and the music so popular there was demand for a national tour. Eventually a few cities were chosen to perform in as the composer was too busy to commit to more.

==Remake==
Fox International Productions and Fuji TV released a Japanese-language remake of the film in October 2009,  often referred to in English as Saidoweizu (the anglicization of its Japanese title). The film is directed by Cellin Gluck and stars Katsuhisa Namase, Fumiyo Kohinata, Kyōka Suzuki, and Rinko Kikuchi, and has a soundtrack composed and performed by Hawaiian-born ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro.

The remake shifts the setting of the film to Napa Valley. Although listed as an executive producer, Payne was not involved with the remake, although he gave it his blessing.  Giamatti declined an invitation to appear in an unspecified cameo appearance in the film. 

==Possible sequel==
Pickett wrote a sequel to his novel, Vertical (novel)|Vertical, in 2011, following Miles and Jack on a road trip to Oregon with Miless mother. However, Payne has declined to consider a sequel to the film. Fox Searchlight owns the rights to the characters, but Paynes lack of interest makes the film a non-starter for Fox.
