Count Dracula (  as El Conde Drácula and in France as Les Nuits de Dracula, is a 1969 Spanish-Italian-German horror film (released in 1970), directed by Jesús Franco and starring Christopher Lee, Herbert Lom and Klaus Kinski. It was based on the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker.
 Hammer production like his other Dracula films, being produced instead by Harry Alan Towers. Klaus Kinski, who would play Dracula himself nine years later in Nosferatu the Vampyre, is also featured in the film as Renfield. Count Dracula was advertised as the most faithful adaptation of Bram Stokers novel.  Among other details, it was the first film version of the novel in which Dracula begins as an old man and becomes younger as he feeds upon fresh blood.

== Plot ==
The story starts with a shot of Count Draculas castle and the following text:

Over fifty years ago, Bram Stoker wrote the greatest of all horror stories. Now, for the first time, we retell exactly as he wrote, one of the first — and still the best — tales of the macabre.
 Bistritz to stay for the night. There, he is warned by a concerned lady against continuing his journey the following day. Harker believes that her concerns are rooted in peasant superstition. He ignores her, but starts to feel increasingly unnerved by the way everyone looks at him. Harker sets off for the rest of his journey and arrives at the Borgo Pass where hes picked up by the Counts mysterious coachman.

Harker debarks at Castle Dracula, and the coach immediately rushes off. Somewhat hesitantly, Harker approaches the main door, whereupon a thin, tall, gaunt old man opens it. Harker asks, "Count Dracula?" "I am Dracula, enter freely and of your own will," says the man at the door. Dracula takes Harker to his bedchamber where Harker notices that Dracula casts no reflection. 

Later, Harker goes to sleep, but wakes up only to find himself in an ancient crypt where he is seduced by three beautiful Brides of Dracula|vampiresses. An enraged Dracula rushes into the room and orders them to leave Harker alone. Dracula explains, "This man belongs to me," then gives the vampiresses a baby to feed on. Harker wakes up screaming in his room and assumes it was a nightmare, but two small wounds on his neck say otherwise.

Harker soon comes to realise hes now a prisoner and tries to escape by climbing out of his bedroom window. He finds his way back to the crypt where he finds Count Dracula and his three brides in coffins. Harker runs out of the crypt, screaming in horror and jumps out of the castles tower into the river below.
 Mina and Lucy also arrive at the hospital to help take care of him. Unbeknownst to them, Count Dracula has followed Harker back to England and now resides in an abandoned abbey close to the hospital.

As Mina nurses Harker back to health, her friend Lucys health strangely declines. Dracula has been secretly appearing to her by night and drinking her blood, growing younger as he feeds off his victim. Quincey Morris, Lucys fiancé, joins Drs. Seward and Van Helsing in an attempt to save Lucy by giving her a blood transfusion from Quincey.
 asylum becomes of considerable interest to the men; Renfield|R. M. Renfield, who is classed as a zoophagus. He eats flies and insects in order to consume their life, believing that with each life he consumes he gains that life. He also seems to act violently whenever Dracula is around.

Lucy eventually dies while her men helplessly look on. As Van Helsing suspected, Lucy has become one of the undead and murders a young child, but the ordeal is put to an end when Quincey, Seward and Van Helsing ambush Lucy in her tomb, stake her through the heart and decapitate her. Harker, now in full health, comes around and joins the group who now are sure that Count Dracula is their vampire.
 Gypsy band.

As Count Draculas Gypsy servants take him back to his castle, he is trailed by Harker and Quincey. After battling the Gypsies, the two heroes find Draculas coffin and set it on fire. Dracula, unable to save himself due to the sun still being up, is consumed by flames.

== Reception ==
Robert Firsching of The New York Times wrote, "This doggedly faithful adaptation is plodding and dull. Even Christopher Lee (in an uncharacteristically weak performance as Dracula), Klaus Kinski (as the mad Renfield), and seven credited screenwriters cannot make this confused, distant film worthwhile. Franco appears as a servant to Professor Van Helsing (Herbert Lom), and though certainly literate, the film nevertheless fails as both horror and drama. 

Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict wrote, "For curious Dracula fans, Jess Francos Count Dracula is a neat find. Its a stellar cast working under a low budget, and it comes off entertaining if not a classic. Its a B-movie treatment at best, but ... Lee comes off fiery and committed to making this Count one that will be noticed."    Brian Lindsey of Eccentric Cinema wrote, "Upon weighing   pros and cons, Count Dracula emerges a substantially flawed film. But I can still recommend it to any fan of Lee, Franco, Miranda, and even of Stokers novel."    George R. Reis of DVD Drive-In wrote, "Count Dracula is flawed in many ways, but for fans of gothic horror, it’s still irresistible ... Barcelona naturally allows for some truly handsome scenery and an appropriate castle for Dracula to dwell in, and the performances of the international cast are above average."  

Dracula scholar Leslie S. Klinger said "the picture begins well, closely following the Stoker narrative account of Harkers encounter with Dracula. The film rapidly proceeds into banality, however, and except for the characterization of Lee as an older Dracula and the brilliant Kinski, the film is largely forgettable." 

== DVD release ==
Count Dracula was released on DVD in 2007 by Dark Sky Films. Special features include an interview with director Jesús Franco, a reading from Bram Stokers Dracula novel by Christopher Lee, and a text essay on the life of actress Soledad Miranda.  The DVD has come under criticism for omitting the scene in which a distraught mother pleads for her babys life at the door of Draculas castle.  The DVD also uses the Italian credits for the film but with the French title card Les Nuits de Dracula.
