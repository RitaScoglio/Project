==Plot== Nicholas II Romanov tricentennial. Dowager Empress sells his Romanov family, sparking the Russian Revolution. Only Marie and Anastasia are able to escape the siege of the palace, thanks to a young servant boy named Dimitri, who shows them a secret passageway in Anastasias room. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside, only to fall through the ice and freeze to death. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but only Marie climbs aboard while Anastasia falls, hitting her head on the platform.
 communist rule, rubles for the safe return of her granddaughter. Two con men, Dimitri and his friend and partner Vladimir, thus search for a look-alike to bring to Paris and pass off as Anastasia so as to collect the reward from Marie. Elsewhere, Anastasia, now using the name "Anya", leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up, having lost her memory prior to arriving there. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names "Pooka", she turns down a job at a fish factory in favor of going to Saint Petersburg after her necklace inspires her to seek out her family in Paris. In the deserted palace she encounters Dimitri and Vladimir, who—impressed by her resemblance to the "real" Anastasia—decide to take her with them.

Bartok, Rasputins albino bat minion is nearby and notices his masters dormant reliquary suddenly revived by Anastasias presence; it drags him to limbo, where the soul of Rasputin survives. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped the curse, Rasputin sends demonic spirits from the reliquary to kill her; despite two attempts, the trio manage to (unwittingly) foil him, forcing Rasputin and Bartok to travel back to the surface.

Anastasia, Dimitri and Vladimir eventually reach Paris and go to meet Marie, who refuses to see her, having been nearly fooled numerous times before by impostors. Despite this, Sophie—Maries cousin—quizzes Anastasia to confirm her identity. Dimitri and Vladimir had taught Anastasia all the answers, but when Anastasia independently (though vaguely) recalls how Dimitri saved her ten years ago, Dimitri finally realizes that she is the real "Grand Duchess", and later informs Vladimir at the Russian Ballet. Dimitri, however, insists they do not reveal this truth to Anastasia. Sophie, convinced as well, arranges for Anastasia to meet Marie after a Russian ballet. However, Marie wants nothing to do with Dimitri, having heard of him and his initial scheme to lie to her. As Anastasia overhears that Dimitri was using her all along as part of his con to get Maries money, she slaps him across the face after she found out that Dimitri lied to her from the beginning and storms out. Dimitri, having fallen in love with Anastasia, manages to change Maries mind by presenting her with Anastasias music box, which he had found after their escape. Anastasias memory returns upon meeting Marie, and grandmother and granddaughter are reunited at long last.

The next day, Marie offers Dimitri the reward money, but to her surprise he refuses it and leaves for Russia, convinced that he cannot be with Anastasia. That night, at Anastasias return celebration, Marie informs her of Dimitris gesture and leaves her to her thoughts. Anastasia then wanders through a garden and onto the Pont Alexandre III, where she is trapped and attacked by Rasputin. Dimitri returns to save her, but is injured and knocked unconscious. Anastasia manages to kill Rasputin by crushing the reliquary under her foot, avenging her family. With Rasputins soul having been tied to the reliquary, he promptly dies and disintegrates.

Afterwards, Dimitri and Anastasia reconcile after Anastasia finally discovers the truth about herself; the two then elope and Anastasia sends a farewell letter to Marie and Sophie, promising to return one day. The film ends with the couple finally kissing on a riverboat and Bartok shares a kiss with a female bat.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Anastasia received a generally positive reception from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 86% based on 51 reviews. The websites consensus reads, "Beautiful animation, an affable take on Russian history, and strong voice performances make Anastasia a winning first film from Fox animation studios."     Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing, "The result is entertaining and sometimes exciting".     Margaret A. McGurk of The Cincinnati Enquirer described Anastasia as "charming" and "entertaining," concluding, "Anastasia serves up a tasty tale about a fairy-tale princess."     Lisa Osbourne of Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice called the film "pure family entertainment."     Awarding the film three out of five stars, Empire (magazine)|Empires Philip Thomas wrote, "Historical inaccuracies aside, Anastasia manages to be a charming little movie".   
 Walt Disney The Phoenixs Jeffrey Gantz jokingly stated, " f imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, then the folks at Disney should feel royally complimented by Twentieth Century Foxs new animated feature about Tsar Nicholas IIs youngest daughter."     Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, "Foxs challenge to the Disney empire is a beautifully animated musical". However, Gleiberman continued, "Anastasia has the Disney house style down cold, yet the magic is missing."   

Critical reception in Russia was also, for the most part, positive despite the artistic liberties that the film took with Russian history. Gemini Films, the Russian distributor of Anastasia, stressed the fact that the story was "not history", but rather "a fairy tale set against the background of real Russian events" in the films Russian marketing campaign so that its Russian audience would not view Anastasia "as a historical film".    As a result, many Russians praised the film for its art and storytelling and saw it as "not so much a piece of history but another Western import to be consumed and enjoyed". 
 canonized as a new martyr in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and a passion bearer in 2000 by the Russian Orthodox Church.  Many historians echoed their sentiments, criticizing the film as a "sanitized, sugar-coated reworking of the story of the   youngest daughter."  While the filmmakers acknowledged the fact that "Anastasia uses history only as a starting point", others complained that the film would provide its audience with misleading facts about Russian history, which, according to the author and historian Suzanne Massie, "has been falsified for so many years."  Similarly, the amateur historian Bob Atchison said that Anastasia was akin to someone making a film in which "Anne Frank moves to Orlando and opens a crocodile farm with a guy named Mort." 

Some of Anastasias contemporary relatives also felt that the film was distasteful, but most Romanovs have come to accept the "repeated exploitation of Anastasias romantic tale ... with equanimity."
