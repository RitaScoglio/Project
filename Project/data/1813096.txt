}} Walter Salles Jr. and starring Peter Coyote. Loosely based on the book A Grande Arte by Brazilian Rubem Fonseca, it is one of the first theatrical works of Salles Jr. The cast includes both Brazilian and international stars such as  Coyote, Tchéky Karyo and Miguel Angel Fuentes.

This film is considered to mark the "revival" of the Brazilian movie industry,  which was until that year in a deep production crisis.

== Plot ==

Peter Mandrake (Coyote), an American photographer in Brazil, is preparing an in loco essay for his new book, about the "Train Surfers" (groups of boys who court danger "surfing" on the roof of the trains) in the city of Rio de Janeiro. A local call girl he is friends with is murdered, and when the police can make no progress Mandrake decides to investigate himself. Subsequently, two hired thugs break into his apartment demanding a disk, and when he doesnt produce it (because he cant) they rape his girlfriend and stab him, leaving him to die. Vowing revenge, Mandrake enlists the help of Hermes (Karyo), a professional knife fighter who owes Mandrake a debt, to teach him the art of knife fighting. The obsession this develops into causes Mandrakes girlfriend to leave him, wanting the whole thing to simply go away, but Mandrake refuses to let go.

The thugs are discovered to be working for an undisclosed Brazilian criminal organization closely tied with the Bolivian cocaine cartel. The head of the organization is attempting to uncover a traitor in his organization, who apparently stole a floppy disk containing important information. Mandrake allies himself with some of the organizations rivals to help them find the disk, in return for discovering who killed the call girl. The disk is ultimately found and Mandrake learns that the organization head murdered the call girl himself, slashing her face in an act of arrogance. Hermes appears suddenly and the head orders him to kill Mandrake, but Hermes tells him to do it himself before leaving. They fight and Mandrake manages to stab his opponent to death.

However, the fulfillment of his revenge quest leaves Mandrake feeling empty and without purpose. He wanders for a while before, on a whim, taking a picture of a couple kissing in a window. This reinvigorates his passion for photography, and whereas he previously took pictures of violent and dangerous situations, now his work has a theme of love and simple pleasures. He heads out to the plains to see his girlfriend, who is an archaeologist working on-site. After showing her the pictures he tells her hes been assigned to Africa, but promises to return someday.

==Knife culture==
The film explores the mysterious and hidden world of the "Persevs" (cut-and-thrust) fighters and some famous Bladesmith|knifesmiths, such as Rex Applegate and William Fairbairn, Bo Randall (the most famous American knifemaker, whose assault knife "Randall 14" is a key weapon in the film) and Joe Kious.
