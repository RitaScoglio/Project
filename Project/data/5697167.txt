 1934 French comedy starring  Buster Keaton. This French-made film has Keaton playing two roles, as an aspiring actor, and as an American gangster. A closing gag has the typically deadpan Keaton breaking out into a big grin after being kissed.

Most all of Keatons dialogue, in French, is dubbed.  The film was never theatrically released in the United States.
