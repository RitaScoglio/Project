==Reception==
The film was the second most popular movie in the US in 1933.  It ended up making an estimated profit of £2,500,000 during its initial theatrical release. 

Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times called the film "most affecting and impressive" and added, "In all its scenes there is a meticulous attention to detail, not only in the settings ... but also in the selection of players ... It is unfurled with such marked good taste and restraint that many an eye will be misty after witnessing this production." 

The film currently holds a rating of 57% on the film review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes with the site stating the critics consensus as "Though solidly acted and pleasant to look at, Cavalcade lacks cohesion, and sacrifices true emotion for mawkishness."

Though 20th Century Fox had no plans to release Cavalcade separately in 2010, it was released separately on Blu-ray Disc in Region A on August 6, 2013 after it received the most write-in votes in a Fox-sponsored online poll.  The Blu-ray edition is a combo pack also containing a DVD of the film.  As of August 2013, the only official DVDs of the film sold in Region 1 are those found in the 80th Anniversary edition Blu-ray combo pack and the 75th Anniversary Collection.
