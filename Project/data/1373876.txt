==Plot==
The story is narrated by the familys oldest son, Paco (Edward James Olmos). The film begins with the father of the family, José Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), making a journey that lasts one year on foot from Mexico to Los Angeles. He travels to Los Angeles to meet a distant relative known as El Californio, who was born in the city when it was still part of Mexico. They become fast friends and grow a corn farm together. However, after several years, El Californio nears death. Shortly before dying, El Californio says he wants the following written on his tombstone:
:When I was born here, this was Mexico, and where I die, this is still Mexico.
 mass roundup, she makes it back to Los Angeles via a long and arduous trip two years later, where she returns home with their new son Chucho.
 Benito Martinez) have grown up. New additions to the family include Toni (Constance Marie), Guillermo "Memo" (played by Greg Albert as a child, and by Enrique Castillo as an adult), and brother Jimmy (Jonathan Hernandez as a child, Jimmy Smits as an adult).
 LAPD before Jimmys eyes, other members of the family learn of Chuchos death also, when they hear gunshots and rush to a nearby street, where they all find his dead body. As an ambulance arrives to take Chuchos lifeless body away, we hear Paco narrate how Chuchos fate had been on borrowed time.

The third generation, which takes place another twenty years later in the 1970s, faces situations such as acculturation, Cultural assimilation|assimilation, and past problems of the family.
 Salvadoran refugee), whom he married so she wouldnt be deported, comes up to him and changes the music in the cassette-player. She tries to get him to dance with her, on the street. At first he doesnt want to and hes not sure he loves her, but she finally succeeds. He asks her at the end of the song, "Will you teach me how to salsa?" It is here that they fall in love for the first time. This scene serves as a metaphor for the continuation of the Sanchez family.

Soon Isabel becomes pregnant, and when she gives birth to their son, Carlitos, she unexpectedly dies. Enraged, Jimmy attacks the doctor he blames for her death, burglarizes a store, and is jailed, leaving his son to be raised by his parents. When Jimmy gets out of prison, he initially doesnt want anything to do with his son who now has behavior problems. When Jimmy finally sees his son, he is filled with joy and immediately wants to care for him. However, his son hates him. The remainder of the movie primarily focuses on Jimmys attempts to form a loving relationship with his estranged son. After much conflict, Jimmys son eventually accepts him and moves with Jimmy to Texas. The film concludes with Jose and Maria reminiscing about their past as Jose says "God has been good to us, weve been very lucky, and our life it has been very...very good" and the camera pans to a shot of contemporary Los Angeles.

===Critical response===
Reviews were generally positive. The film has an 83% "Fresh" rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on ten reviews from professional critics, with an average rating of 7.3/10. 

Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, liked the direction of the film, and wrote, "Their story is told in images of startling beauty and great overflowing energy; it is rare to hear so much laughter from an audience that is also sometimes moved to tears. Few movies like this get made because few filmmakers have the ambition to open their arms wide and embrace so much life." 
 El Norte) does a fine job orchestrating the many events in this emotionally resonant drama." 

But not all were so kind. Caryn James, in a film review in The New York Times wrote the film was "wildly uneven" and "offers a trite, overblown narration by Edward James Olmos and an often flagging sense of drama."  She was also not happy with Navas direction and wrote, "  seems so enamored of the texture of Mexican-American life that he glides past any sense of character."   Yet, she was very complimentary of Jimmy Smits performance.
