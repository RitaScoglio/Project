==Plot==
The movie opens with shots from the Spanish Civil War, and a line of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France after defeat by the Francoists, Manuel Artiguez (Gregory Peck) turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying "Manuel, the war is over!". 
 Francoists in Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldnt tell the police where to find Artiguez. 

Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguezs mother (Mildred Dunnock) is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother. In return for information about the layout of the hospital and surrounding area, Paco tells Artiguez to "bump into Viñolas" for him. 

 

After Viñolas has laid his trap, Artiguezs mother dies (after asking a priest to warn her son not to come), but Viñolas sends a spy to convince Artiguez otherwise, and to come visit her. When the priest appears at Artiguezs house, hes gone, so the priest tells Paco to pass on the message that his mother is dead, and not to go to San Martín. 

For selfish reasons, Paco rips up the letter and doesnt pass on the message. Afterwards, Paco recognizes the man (Carlos) in Artiguezs house as an informer, and tells Artiguez about the priests message. Trying to clear up the mess, Artiguez takes Paco and Carlos to Lourdes to find the priest, but hes not there, and they let Carlos go. On the way back, however, they see the priest, and take him to Artiguezs house. 

When Carlos returns for his rucksack, Artiguez asks the priest to come out. Carlos, knowing he is exposed, fights Artiguez and escapes. 

After much internal debate, Artiguez then decides to go to San Martín anyway, presumably with the mission of killing Viñolas. Once in San Martín, Artiguez encounters a Francoist sniper on the roof of the hospital and attacks him, sending him to his death. Once inside the hospital, he kills a few officers, but is finally shot.

Soldiers and officers congratulate Viñolas on at last killing his enemy, but he asks one of his lieutenants, knowing his mother was already dead and a trap would be waiting for him, why did Artiguez come back?

The final shot is of the morgue, with the soldiers Artiguez killed and Artiguez himself (and his dead mother), wheeled in on gurneys and arranged in a row, dead.

Filming began on June 13, 1963, and continued for a little over 100 days, running nearly a month over schedule. After Columbia previewed the film for US audiences, they decided that an intro was needed to provide background relating to the Spanish Civil War, so clips from the documentary about the war To Die in Madrid were interspersed with dialogue explaining the conflict.

|quote=The reaction to that was a disappointment, but it was justified. The point simply did not get over. I took too much for granted. I thought the Spanish Civil War was still with us, but apparently it is dead, in spite of all those refugees. There were other troubles too - with the Franco government. I was to blame for playing the Spanish Civil Guard as heavies. They are sacred cows. Columbia suffered heavily through the Franco ban on their films because of Pale Horse but they were wonderfully good about it.
