Ahí está el detalle ( )    is a 1940 Mexican comedy film starring Cantinflas. It was produced by Jesús Grovas and directed by Juan Bustillo Oro, and also features Joaquín Pardavé, Sara García, Sofía Álvarez, and Dolores Camarillo. It was the twelfth film in Cantinflass career, considered one of his best by Mexican film critics, as well as one of Mexicos best films.   

==Plot summary==
Cantinflas is the boyfriend of Paz, the household maid Cayetano Lastre. It is dinnertime and Cantinflas is waiting outside the mansion for Pazs whistle: a sign for Cantinflas to enter the kitchen to eat. This is because there is a dog in the front yard named "Bobby", and Pazs boss is unaware of Cantinflass forays into the house. Though like other times Cantinflas goes straight in to eat, this time his girlfriend has a favor to ask him, that of killing the dog "Bobby" who has suffered a sudden onset of rabies and will not let Cayetano leave for an appointment. If he does not kill the dog, he does not get to eat. Cantinflas is nervous about the idea, but eventually kills him with a gun. However, inside the house, Cayetano plots a scheme to expose his wife Dolores del Pasos supposed "adultery" with her ex-boyfriend, Bobby Lechuga. Dolores is not in a relationship with Bobby Lechuga, but Cayetanos over-bearing jealousy leads him to think otherwise.
