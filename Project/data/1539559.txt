===Critical response===
When the film was released, The New York Times gave the film a positive review and lauded the direction of the picture and the acting, writing, " s fragmentary realism the picture rings true and persuasive. Mr. Ryans portrayal of the gritty, determined protagonist is, of course, a natural. Miss Fleming, one of Hollywoods coolest, prettiest villainesses, knows how to handle literate dialogue, which, in this case, she shares." 
 Time Out Film Guide called the film, "A tight and involving essay in suspense which works on the ingenious idea of leaving the audience alone in the desert with an unsympathetic and selfish character," and noted the finer aspects of the 3-Dimension film, writing, "Inferno was one of the best and last movies to be made in 3-D during the boom in the early 50s. Certainly its use of space emphasized the dramatic possibilities of 3-D and reveals, as more than one person has observed, that the device had largely been squandered in other films made at the time." 

Film critic Dennis Schwartz liked the film and wrote, "Inferno loses something when not seen in 3-D as intended when released, nevertheless it remains as a taut survival thriller. It makes good use of 3-D, in fact it does it better than most other such gimmicky films...The desert photography by Lucien Ballard is stunning.
