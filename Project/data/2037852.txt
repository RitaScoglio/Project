== Plot ==
  Jason Lee) is engaged to Elaine (Leslie Mann), and intends to use his life savings of $30,000 to put a down payment on a house. He works for Elains father, Mr.&nbsp;Warner (Dennis Farina), who already considers John unworthy of his daughter. Simultaneously, Johns niece Noreen (Tammy Blanchard), daughter of Johns sister, Patty (Megan Mullally), is accepted to Harvard University, but needs an additional $30,000 on top of her grants and scholarships. Noreen shows John an old videotape where he promised to pay for Noreens college. John now has a moral and financial dilemma – disappoint his fiancée or disappoint his niece and take away her only chance to escape from poverty.

John confides in his friend Walter "Duff" Duffy (Tom Green). Duff, a landscaper, convinces John to steal from one of his rich landscaping clients, who keeps large amounts of cash in an unlocked safe. The pair set off to steal the cash, but Duff runs away when lights come on in the home, leaving John to get caught by Emmett Cook (Richard Jenkins).  Cook forces John to cross-dress and role-play the part of Cooks late wife as the two men lie in bed and "spoon". Eventually, after taking an incriminating photograph of John, Cook releases him.  As he is leaving, Mr.&nbsp;Warner rides by and takes note of Johns panicked behavior, believing that he has caught John in an affair.
 con a ecstasy ring. A police detective (John C. McGinley) is on to John and Duff, but never has enough evidence to actually pin any of the crimes on them. Meanwhile, Mr.&nbsp;Warner breaks into Cooks residence in order to get evidence against John, and once Cook catches him, he is forced to "spoon" as well. Before leaving, Warner finds the photo of John from the album, which he then gives to Elaine.
 breaking and animal cruelty. John feels like his goose is cooked, until the judge in charge of his arraignment turns out to be the gun-toting Emmett Cook.

Upon their mutual recognition, John writes, in his lawyers notebook, a message to Cook and flashes it across the court, threatening to expose the judges fetish; upon reading the makeshift sign, Cook quickly dismisses all charges against John. Finally, Duff comes through as best he can and gives John his life savings, $1,000, which John bets on a longshot horse which wins and which paid 30 to 1. John and Elaine are married, Noreen goes off to college, and, in the final scene, John is left to ponder how loser Duff could possibly accumulate $1,000 – the last scene shows Duff offering to "spoon" with Cook for $1,000.
