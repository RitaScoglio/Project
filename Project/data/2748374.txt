Dil Hai Tumhaara (  Bollywood romantic comedy and family film starring Arjun Rampal, Preity Zinta, Mahima Chaudhry, Jimmy Shergill, Rekha and Alok Nath. The film performed poorly at the Indian box office, however Zintas performance was praised by critics and earned her nominations at a number of award ceremonies. The music of the film, composed by Nadeem-Shravan, went on to do well on the charts.

== Plot == relationships with her mother, Saritaji (Rekha), and sister, Nimmi (Mahima Chaudhary). Unknown to Shalu and Nimmi, they are only half-sisters, as Shalu is the daughter of Saritajis late husband with the woman he had been having an affair with. Wounded in a car accident with Shalus biological mother, he begged Saritaji on his death bed to accept Shalu as her own.

Although Saritaji adopted Shalu, she cannot forget the truth of Shalus hidden parentage, and so gives her none of the love she shows to her real daughter, Nimmi. Shalu, on the other hand, loves Saritaji, whom she believes is her real mother. She constantly craves her mothers affection but does not get it, so she retaliates by being rebellious, thinking it is the only way to get her mothers attention. Unlike their mother, Nimmi loves Shalu very much and constantly stands up for her, though she refuses to think ill-will of Saritaji.

Eventually a young man named Dev Khanna (Arjun Rampal) enters the sisters lives. Dev and Shalu initially do not get along but eventually fall in love. However, circumstances make Nimmi believe that Dev is in love with her, not Shalu. Saritaji, only aware of Nimmis side of the story, offers a marriage proposal to Devs father (Alok Nath) on Nimmis behalf. When Saritaji sees Dev and Shalu being affectionate, she jumps to the conclusion that Shalu has stolen Dev from Nimmi, just as Shalus mother stole Saritajis husband from her. Saritaji confronts Shalu in anger and reveals her true heritage in front of Nimmi.
 
Shalu, who has long craved her mothers love, decides to sacrifice Dev to make her mother and sister happy. When Dev learns of this situation from Shalu, he is confused and dismayed, but agrees to marry Nimmi to make Shalu happy. When Nimmi notices that something is wrong with Shalu, Shalu deflects the question by saying that she has fallen in love with Samir (Jimmy Shergill), her childhood friend who has been in love with her for years.

On the engagement day, Saritajis political rivals try to use Shalus illegitimate heritage to threaten Nimmis marriage to Dev, who is from a prominent family. Shalu takes matters into her own hands, rushing to Devs house where she publicly announces to Devs entire family that she is illegitimate, arguing that it is proof of Saritajis kindness and generosity that Shalu was adopted into her family, and it would be an injustice if the marriage were cancelled solely because of her. Devs father is impressed with Shalus courage, and promises that nothing will stop the marriage from taking place.

Saritaji secretly witnesses Shalus confession and is deeply touched. She is ashamed of how she has treated Shalu in the past, and they share their first hug together. Saritaji tells her that she will ask Nimmi to step aside if Shalu and Dev are really in love, but Shalu stops her from doing so, saying that now she has her mothers love and acceptance, she does not want anything else.

Nimmi is very happy that her mother has accepted Shalu but she still feels that something is not quite right with her sister. She soon learns of the whole ruse from Samir, and gladly steps aside in order for Shalu and Dev to be united.
