==Plot==
Southern Airways Flight 932 was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 that Marshall University chartered to transport the Thundering Herd football team to Greenville, North Carolina, via Stallings Field in Kinston, North Carolina, and back to Marshalls campus in Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington, West Virginia. On the evening of November 14, 1970, the aircraft clipped trees on a ridge just one mile short of the runway at Tri-State Airport in Ceredo, West Virginia, and crashed into a gully.
 East Carolina University Pirates, a 17–14 loss. There were no survivors. In all, 75 people lost their lives. The deceased included the 37 players; head coach Rick Tolley and five members of his coaching staff; Charles E. Kautz, Marshalls athletics director; team athletic trainer Jim Schroer and his assistant, Donald Tackett; 25 booster club|boosters; and five crew members.
 Red Dawson, the sole surviving member of the previous coaching staff, manages to rebuild the team in a relatively short time, despite losing many of their prospects to West Virginia University. Dedmon travels to Kansas City, where he pleads with the NCAA to waive their rule prohibiting freshmen from playing varsity football (a rule which had been abolished in 1968 for all sports except for football and basketball, and would be permanently abolished for those sports in 1972). Dedmon returns victorious.
 Morehead State Eagles. The loss weighs heavily on Dawson and Ruffin, who had been hurt in the first play of the game. The Herds first post-crash victory is a heart-stopping 15–13 home win against Xavier University in the first home game of the season.

==Critical reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49% out of 124 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.8/10 and the site consensus stating: "Matthew McConaughey almost runs We Are Marshall to the end zone, but cant stop it from taking the easy, feel-good route in memorializing this historic event in American sports." 

The films directing was criticized by many reviewers. Peter Hartlaub, from the San Francisco Chronicle, blamed director McG for "half of the movie problems" and went further on saying that "He has a kinetic and kitschy style that could make next years "Hot Wheels" movie a surprise hit, but hes completely out of place here."  Peter Howell from the Toronto Star said the film lacked genuine drama or conflict. 

McConaugheys performance was, according to some critics, one of the films highlights. Roger Moore from the Orlando Sentinel gave it 4 stars out of 5 and said in his review that "We Are Marshall (its the rally cry of the team) doesnt always have a handle on the grief, but it does keep emotions close to the surface. That allows McConaughey to be the most refreshing, funny and believable he ever has been."

*The name of the movie is based on a cheer performed by students and players at the university, which is also featured prominently in the movie.
*In the movie, newspaper headlines are from the combined Sunday newspaper of the Huntington Herald-Dispatch. 
*In the movie, a radio announcer calls Marshalls opponent the "Xavier Pirates." In real life, the schools nickname was, and still is, the Xavier Musketeers. "Pirates" is the nickname of East Carolina University, Marshalls opponent in their final game before the crash.

==Cameos==
 
*In the end credits of the movie, clips are shown of some of the more prominent players in Marshall history, such as former  ; wide receiver Randy Moss; and quarterback Byron Leftwich.
*The real William "Red" Dawson can be seen in the movie as the coach of Morehead State.
*1971 quarterback Dave Walsh can be seen in the movie as an assistant for Xavier.
*The real Jack Lengyel had a cameo appearance in the movie. 
*Another notable cameo was by Keith Morehouse, the current sports director for WSAZ-TV in Huntington and play-by-play announcer for Marshall broadcasts. He followed in the footsteps of his father Gene Morehouse, who was Marshalls play-by-play announcer when he was killed in the crash. Keiths future wife was one of the 18 children left orphaned by the crash.
*Sonny Perdue, governor of Georgia at the time the movie was filmed, has a cameo role as an East Carolina assistant coach.
*Dorsey Levens, a former Green Bay Packers running back, has a cameo as the Xavier head coach. This casting is an anachronism as well, since no major college football program would hire an African American head coach until 1979. Cabell County sheriff and Huntington mayor Kim Wolfe appears as a police officer in the scene of the crash aftermath.
