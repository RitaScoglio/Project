He admits to being on a spying mission, which he tries to justify by saying he wants to save Malta from further destruction.  He realises that he will almost certainly be executed.  .

Later the next day, Maria sits by the beach, thinking of her beloved Peter.  In the end it is implied (by newspaper) that the attack was a success, as the Afrika Corps has lost the Second Battle of El Alemain (in part due to supply shortages) and thus their foothold in Africa.

==Production==
The Ulster born director Brian Desmond Hurst was persuaded by his lifelong friend, John Ford, to direct the Malta Story.  Ford told Hurst, "its right up your street."   briandesmondhurst.org. Retrieved: 11 January 2012.  Thorold Dickinson who, along with Peter De Sarigny, wrote the story, was originally scheduled to helm the film. 
 Messerschmitt Bf 109F fighters and Junkers Ju 88 bombers can be seen, along with many other wartime RAF aircraft. Parish 1990, p. 268.  Additionally, many scenes were shot in Malta with the real types of aircraft still in operational service at that time, some of which did not exist any longer elsewhere.  The production only had the use of three later Supermarine Spitfire Mk XVIs, which had been located in storage.  Although a modicum of model work and studio rear projection footage was needed, careful editing of archival newsreel and location photography created an authentic looking, near-documentary style.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Malta Story was the fourth most popular movie at the British box office in 1953.  "The combination of an A-list cast, the portrayal of the iron resilience of the Maltese people, the gallantry of the RAF pilots and a tragic love story were the four components of its success."  

===Critical reception===
A contemporary review in The New York Times considered Malta Story as "restrained, routine fare."  The reviewer continued,  "However, the commendable British reserve they display in the face of peril does not add luster to the standard yarn in which they are involved.  This Malta Story, unlike the actual one, does not stir the senses or send the spirit soaring."  Variety, however, called it, "(an) epic story of courage and endurance ..."  

In a later review of Malta Story, Leonard Maltin commented that "on-location filming of this WW2 British-air-force-in-action yarn is sparked by underplayed acting."  Aviation film historians, Jack Hardwick and Ed Schnepf gave it a 3/5 rating, noting the use of period aircraft made it "good buff material."
