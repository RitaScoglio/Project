==Plot==
A mysterious killer, known only as "The Judge," kills anyone he considers worthless. Detective Harry Grant is assigned to track him down. With just a handful of clues, Grant constructs a faceless dummy to help his men conduct their investigation.

==Reception==
The New York Times was dismissive of the film and wrote, "There is no intelligent reason why anyone should heed the proposal of Follow Me Quietly... or this utterly senseless little thriller is patently nothing more than a convenient one-hour time-killer between performances of the eight-act vaudeville bill."   Reviewing it on DVD, Gene Triplett of The Oklahoman wrote, " his obscure gem packs a remarkable amount of thrills and dramatic weight into a mere 59 minutes".   Paul Mavis of DVD Talk rated it 4.5/5 stars and called it a "strange, unsettling film noir mystery, with a disturbing subtext".
