}} independent drama Henry V, and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them to Mikes hometown in Idaho and then to Italy in search of Mikes mother.

Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechys 1963 novel, City of Night, and concluding that Rechys treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scotts story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. He sent copies of his script to Reeves and to Phoenix, assuming that they would turn it down, but both agreed to star in the film.

==Plot== Mike (River street hustler, narcoleptic episode and dreams of his mother comforting him as he replays home movies of his childhood in his mind.
 fellated by a client in Seattle, Washington, Mike returns to his favorite spots to pick up potential clients. He is picked up by a wealthy older woman (Grace Zabriskie) who takes him to her mansion where he meets two fellow hustlers also hired by the woman. One of them is Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves), Mike’s best friend, and the other is Gary (Rodney Harvey). While preparing to have sex with the woman, Mike experiences another narcoleptic fit and awakens the next day with Scott in Portland, Oregon.

Mike and Scott are soon reunited with Bob Pigeon (William Richert), a middle-aged mentor to a gang of street kids and hustlers who live in an abandoned apartment building. Scott, the son of the mayor of Portland, admits to Bob in private that when he turns 21, he will inherit his father’s fortune and retire from street hustling. Mike yearns to find his mother, and he and Scott leave Portland for Idaho to visit Mike’s older brother Richard (James Russo), who lives in a run-down trailer. Along this journey Mike confesses that he is in love with Scott. Richard tries to tell Mike who his real father is, but Mike says that he knows it is Richard. Richard tells Mike that their mother works as a hotel maid; when Mike and Scott visit the hotel, they find she has gone to Italy in search of her own family.

Mike and Scott travel to Italy where they find the country farmhouse where Mike’s mother worked, as a maid and as an English tutor. The young woman, Carmela (Chiara Caselli), who lives there tells Mike that his mother returned to the United States months ago. Carmela and Scott fall in love and return to the U.S., leaving Mike to return home on his own, brokenhearted. Scotts father dies, and Scott inherits his fortune.

Back in Portland, Bob and his gang confront a newly reformed Scott at a fashionable restaurant, but he rejects them. That night Bob has a fatal heart attack. The next day the hustlers hold a rowdy funeral for Bob, while in the same cemetery, a few yards away, Scott attends a solemn funeral for his father. Mike is back on a deserted stretch of Idaho highway. He falls into another narcoleptic stupor and two strangers pull up in a truck, steal Mike’s backpack and shoes and drive away. Moments later, an unidentified figure pulls up in a car, picks Mike up, places him in the vehicle and drives off.

==Development==
The origins of My Own Private Idaho came from John Rechys 1963 novel, City of Night, which featured characters who were street hustlers who did not admit to being gay. {{cite news

After reading Rechys book, Van Sant realized that it was considerably better than what he was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing Mala Noche, Van Sant met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later become My Own Private Idaho.  Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people Van Sant had met in Portland who were street hustlers. 

Early drafts of the screenplay were set on Hollywood Boulevard, not Portland, with working titles such as Blue Funk and Minions of the Moon. {{cite news

In essence, this method involves various story fragments and ideas mixed and matched together to form a unique story. The idea to combine the two scenarios formed in Van Sants mind after watching Orson Welles Chimes at Midnight.  The director remembers, "I thought that the Henry IV plays were really a street story. I also knew this fat guy named Bob, who had always reminded me of Falstaff and who was crazy about hustler boys". Van Sant realized that Prince Hal in the plays resembled the character of Scott and the sidekick was Mike. His script ended up becoming a literal restructuring of the Henry IV plays. Fuller 1993, p. xxv.  Van Sant got the idea for Mikes narcolepsy from a man who was a guide of sorts when the director was gathering material for the film. According to the director, he always looked like he was about to fall asleep. {{cite news

Van Sant showed the script to an executive at 20th Century Fox who liked Shakespeare.  Eventually, he toned down the Shakespeare and made the language more modern. Van Sant was also working on a short story called My Own Private Idaho which he intended to film. It was 25 pages long and was about two Latino characters on the streets of Portland who go in search of their parents and travel to a town in Spain. One of them falls in love with a girl and leaves the other behind. Fuller 1993, p. xxv.  Van Sant had another script called The Boys of Storytown, which had the Mike and Scott characters and Mike had narcolepsy. The characters of Hans and Bob were also present. Van Sant wanted to make the film but felt that the script was not finished. Fuller 1993, p. xxvi.  While editing Drugstore Cowboy, Van Sant combined the scripts for Modern Days and Storytown with the Idaho short story. 

===Casting===
* River Phoenix as Mikey Waters
* Keanu Reeves as Scott Favor
* James Russo as Richard Waters
* Rodney Harvey as Gary
* William Richert as Bob Pigeon
* Grace Zabriskie as Alena
* Chiara Caselli as Carmela Flea as Budd
* Udo Kier as Hans
* Jim Caviezel as Airline Clerk
* Brian Wilson as Rock Promoter

Initially, no studio would finance the film because of its potentially controversial and off-beat subject matter. After Drugstore Cowboy received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest.  However, they all wanted their own versions made and not Van Sants. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, who was going to play Scott. 

Van Sant faced the problem of casting the two central roles. He decided to send the script to the agents of Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, figuring that their agents would reject the script. {{cite news

Van Sant got an offer of $2 million from an outside investor but when he put off production for nine months so that Phoenix could make Dogfight (film)|Dogfight, the investor and his money disappeared. Fuller 1993, p. xxxvi.  Producer Laurie Parker shopped the script around and, at the time, New Line Cinema was in the process of branching out into producing arthouse films and decided to back Van Sants vision with a United States dollar|USD$2.5 million budget. 

===Principal photography===
Phoenix arrived in Portland two weeks before principal photography was to begin in order to do research and Van Sant remembered, "He seemed to be changing into this character". {{cite news

One of the films directors of photography Eric Alan Edwards recalled that the actor looked like a street kid", and "in a very raw way he wore that role. Ive never seen anybody so intent on living his role".  Several cast and crew members, including Michael Parker, Phoenix, Reeves and Flea lived together in a house in Portland during filming. A couple of times a week they would play music together. Due to the low budget, a typical day of shooting started at 6 am and ended at 11 pm. 

The film was not storyboarded and was made without a shot list. Fuller 1993, p. xxxiv.  The camp fire scene was originally a short, three-page scene  that Phoenix re-wrote into an eight-page scene where Mike professes his love for Scott so that it was more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous.  Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, "Im not against gays or anything, but I wont have sex with guys. I would never do that on film. We did a little of it in Idaho and, believe me, it was hard work. Never again". 

Eric Edwards shot the time-lapse photography shots on his own. Fuller 1993, p. xxxix.  They were not in the script and the films producer was worried that he was using up too much film. Van Sant originally had the screen go black when Mike passed out but was not satisfied with this approach. He used Edwards footage as a way of "an altered sense of time" from Mikes perspective.  Some executives at New Line were not in favor of the Shakespeare scenes and wanted Van Sant to cut them all out. However, foreign distributors wanted as much Shakespeare in the film as possible. Fuller 1993, p. xxxviii.

===Critical response===
  
Van Sants film achieved critical acclaim. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote, "The achievement of this film is that it wants to evoke that state of drifting need, and it does. There is no mechanical plot that has to grind to a Hollywood conclusion, and no contrived test for the heroes to pass."    
In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers wrote, "Van Sants cleareyed, unsentimental approach to a plot that pivots on betrayal and death is reflected in magnetic performances from Reeves and Phoenix."    
 ) and Mr. Reeves (of the two Bill and Ted comedies) are very fine in what may be the two best roles theyll find in years. Roles of this density, for young actors, do not come by that often".    
In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen praised Phoenixs performance: "The campfire scene in which Mike awkwardly declares his unrequited love for Scott is a marvel of delicacy. In this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget youve seen him before: its a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once."    
Entertainment Weekly gave the film an "A−" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, "When Van Sant shows us speeded-up images of clouds rolling past wheat fields, the familiar device transcends cliche, because its tied to the way that Mike, in his benumbed isolation, experiences his own life – as a running piece of surrealism. The sheer, expressive beauty of those images haunted me for days."   
J. Hoberman, in his review for The Village Voice, wrote, "While Phoenix vanishes with reckless triumph into his role, Reeves stands, or occasionally struts, uneasily beside his, unable to project even the self-mocking wit of Matt Dillons star turn in Drugstore Cowboy."    Hal Hinson from the Washington Post wrote “Gus Van Sant‘s sensibility is wholly original, wholly fresh. My Own Private Idaho adds a new ingredient: a kind of boho sweetness. I loved it.”    

However, USA Today gave My Own Private Idaho two and half stars out of four, criticizing Van Sants film for being "nothing but set pieces; tossed into a mix whose meaning is almost certainly private".    
Time (magazine)|Time magazines Richard Schickel wrote, "What plot it has is borrowed, improbably, from Henry IV, and whenever anyone manages to speak an entire paragraph, it is usually a Shakespearean paraphrase. But this is a desperate imposition on an essentially inert film."    
In his review for The New Yorker, Terrence Rafferty wrote, "Van Sant has stranded the actor in a movie full of flat characters and bad ideas, but Phoenix walks through the picture, down the road after road after road, as if he were surrounded by glorious phantoms."   

Review aggregation website   gives the film a weighted average score of 77% based on 18 reviews.   Retrieved 27 April 2013
