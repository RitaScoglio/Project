==Plot== Battle of Guadalcanal has joined the American Red Cross on the island to entertain American servicemen.  Her leader at the service club, Kate Connors (Ritter) had initially been reluctant to have her assigned to New Caledonia lest she use her position as a pilgrimage to find out about her late husband.  In addition to entertaining, serving the soldiers and giving French lessons, the Red Cross women are expected to help with the wounded â€” which Lee initially refuses to do.
 Lt Col Black (Holden) objects to the Red Cross women treating his men softly; he states that the only place for women in war are "skirts" that the men chase and the "sweethearts" that wait for them back home.  He changes his mind when he tries to seduce the attractive Lee, who initially refuses his advances.  Lt Col Black decides to gain her interest by pretending he knew Lees late husband and was with him shortly before he died.  Though Lee despises the Colonels arrogance and demands, she is fascinated by him and falls in love with him.

Another member of the battalion is the Navy Chaplain, Lieutenant Junior Grade Holmes (William Redfield) whom Kate notices is a changed, silent, and saddened man since she last knew him.  During a battle the Chaplain had gathered some Marines together in prayer. A Japanese soldier, thought to be dead, used the group as a target for his hand grenade, killing several and wounding their sergeant with a spinal injury. Lt Col Black demotes the wounded sergeant in rank because he should have known better than to let his men gather in the open.  Black constantly harasses the Chaplain by never letting him forget that his presence caused their deaths, with the bodies of the Marines shielding the Chaplain from any injury. Holmess guilt is compounded by a tropical fever and exhaustion from working that has taken its toll.
