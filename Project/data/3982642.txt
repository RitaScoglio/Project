==Background== Frank Wilson, which was serialized in Colliers in 1947.
 Prohibition era Capone was organized crime following Prohibitions repeal).  And of course, IRS Criminal Investigator Frank Wilson became IRS Criminal Investigator Frank Warren.
 The Untouchables.

As one example, in The Untouchables the judge presiding over Capones trial abruptly changes juries in the middle of the case, something that would never happen in real life.  What actually happened was that the judge switched jury panels just before the trial began, and this incident is accurately portrayed in The Undercover Man.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Bosley Crowther panned the film, writing, "Furthermore—and this is fatal—it is a drearily static film, for all its explosive flurries of gun-play and passing of violent threats. The big crisis in the picture comes when the Treasury man, played by Glenn Ford, is uncertain whether to stick with the case or retire to a farm. And the basis of his decision to go on sleuthing for Uncle Sam is a long-winded lecture on justice which a sad-eyed Italian woman gives. Mr. Ford, in a battered gray hat and a baggy suit, makes a pretty case for higher salaries to civil servants but a not very impressive sleuth. And James Whitmore, who played the sergeant in "Command Decision" on the stage, seems much more inclined to low clowning than to accounting as an assistant on the case. Barry Kelley is robustly arrogant as "the big fellows" lawyer and front-man, with several other performers doing standard character roles." 

Yet, the staff at Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine gave the film a positive review, and wrote, "Narrated in a straightforward, hardhitting documentary style, The Undercover Man is a good crime-busting saga. Standout features are the pics sustained pace and its realistic quality. Fresh, natural dialog help to cover up the formula yarn, while topnotch performances down the line carry conviction. Joseph H. Lewiss direction also mutes the melodramatic elements but manages to keep the tension mounting through a series of violent episodes." 
 Time Out film guide lauded the film and wrote, "A superior crime thriller in the semi-documentary style beloved by Hollywood in the late 1940s...  achieves an authenticity rare in the genre. Perhaps even more impressive is the acknowledgment that mob crime affects not only cops and criminals, but innocents too: witnesses are silenced, bystanders injured. And Lewis - one of the B movie greats - directs in admirably forthright, muscular fashion, making superb use of Burnett Guffeys gritty monochrome camerawork."
