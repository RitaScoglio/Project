==Plot==
Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho), business manager for the wealthy Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont), is having dinner with another woman in the same restaurant. When they find each other at opposite tables, Driftwood joins Mrs. Claypool, and introduces her to Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman), director of the New York Opera Company, also dining at the restaurant. Driftwood has arranged for Mrs. Claypool to invest $200,000 in the opera company, allowing  Gottlieb to engage Rodolfo Lassparri, (Walter Woolf King), the “greatest tenor since Caruso”. Alan Jones) hires his best friend Fiorello (Chico) to be his manager. Ricardo is in love with the soprano, Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle), who is also being pursued by Lassparri. Driftwood finds Lassparri attacking his dresser, Tomasso (Harpo), who knocks Lassparri unconscious by hitting him on the head. Fiorello enters and identifies himself as the manager of the "greatest tenor in the world". Driftwood, mistakenly thinking Fiorello is referring to Lassparri, signs Baroni to a contract. Stateroom scene below)
Lassparri later spots the stowaways among the immigrants on the ship and they are caught and thrown into the brig. They escape and are able to sneak into the country by assuming the identities of three famous bearded aviators, who are traveling aboard the ship. After a welcoming reception in New York, their true identities are discovered and they hide out in Driftwoods hotel room, pursued by police sergeant Henderson (Robert Emmett OConnor).
Meanwhile, Ricardo is reunited with Rosa after climbing in the window of her hotel room. Ricardo has an altercation with Lassparri, which results in both Rosa and Driftwood being fired from the opera company by Gottlieb. The boys decide to seek revenge by sabotaging the opening night performance of Il Trovatore and they abduct Lassparri, forcing Gottlieb to substitute Ricardo and Rosa in his place. The audience clearly prefers Baroni, and Lassparri is booed and pelted with fruit after he attempts to return to the stage.
The film ends with Driftwood and Fiorello attempting to negotiate another contract, as Rosa and Ricardo sing an encore.

==Selected scenes==

===Stateroom scene===
This scene, one of the most famous comedy scenes of all time,  was developed with participation of silent comedy great, then gag writer, Buster Keaton who took inspiration from a simpler precursor in his own film, The Cameraman.  

Driftwood plans a rendezvous with Mrs. Claypool in his stateroom; then he finds out how small it is, and that he, his trunk, and the bed barely fit in it. Fiorello insists on getting something to eat ("We getta food or we dont go"). So Driftwood calls a steward ("I say, Stew") and orders dinner.

  
Driftwood: And two medium-boiled eggs.
Fiorello: (inside room): And two hard-boiled eggs.
Driftwood: And two hard-boiled eggs.
Tomasso: (inside room): (honk)
Driftwood: Make that three hard boiled eggs.
  

 
This continues until Fiorello and Tomasso have ordered about a dozen hard-boiled eggs and Driftwood has ordered about everything else&mdash;including coffee to sober up some stewed prunes. However, this is just to set the viewer up for the famous "Stateroom Scene", which sees a total of 15 people in Driftwoods tiny ships cabin, already containing a bed and a big wardrobe trunk.

The scene starts with Driftwood finding out that Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo Baroni managed to sneak onto the boat by stowing away in his steamer trunk. Fiorello and Tomasso have to hide out in the room while a parade of people walk in, asking to either use their cabin for something, or to perform their appointed tasks. Crammed into this little space at the end of the scene are: Driftwood, Fiorello, Tomasso, Baroni, two cleaning ladies who make up the bed, a manicurist, a ships engineer and his assistant, a girl looking for her aunt, a maid ("I come to mop up." "Youll have to start on the ceiling.") and four waiters with trays of food (prompting Driftwoods classic line: "Is it my imagination, or is it getting crowded in here?"). The mass of humanity tumbles out into the hallway when Mrs. Claypool opens the door.

===Contract scene===
The contract scene between Driftwood and Fiorello ("the party of the first part ..."):

  
Fiorello: Hey, wait, wait. What does this say here, this thing here?
Driftwood: Oh, that? Oh, thats the usual clause thats in every contract. That just says, uh, it says, uh, if any of the parties participating in this contract are shown not to be in their right mind, the entire agreement is automatically nullified.
Fiorello: Well, I dont know...
Driftwood: Its all right. Thats, thats in every contract. Thats, thats what they call a sanity clause. Sanity Clause!

==Production==
  and Groucho Marx|Groucho]]

In an interview with Richard J. Anobile in The Marx Brothers Scrapbook, Groucho said he was so appalled by an early draft of the script—which was reportedly written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby—that he screamed, "Why fuck around with second-rate talent, get Kaufman and Ryskind  !"  

At the suggestion of producer Irving Thalberg, the film marked a change of direction in the brothers career. In their Paramount films, the brothers characters were much more anarchism|anarchic: they attacked anybody who was so unfortunate to cross their paths whether they deserved it or not, albeit comically. Thalberg, however, felt that this made the brothers unsympathetic, particularly to female filmgoers. So in the MGM films, the brothers were recast as more helpful characters, saving their comic attacks for the villains.

Though some Marx Brothers fans were appalled at these changes, Thalberg was vindicated when the film became a solid hit. It helped that the film contained some of what fans consider to be the brothers funniest routines. These routines were honed on Theatre|stage, as the brothers performed the new material on the road before filming began.

However, according to Oscar Levant, the first preview was a "disaster", with "hardly a laugh" as was the second. Thalberg and George S. Kaufman spent days in the editing room, adjusting the timing to match the rhythm of a stage performance. About nine minutes was cut from the running time, and the result was a hit. 

===Opera=== Allan Jones. Italian buffet and dancing.
 Allan Jones, who were both trained in operatic singing, provided their own singing voices in the film. Walter Woolf King was a trained baritone but he portrayed a tenor in the film. His singing was dubbed by Metropolitan Opera tenor Tandy MacKenzie.

===Subsequent re-editing=== Leo the Lion (MGMs iconic mascot); Harpo Marx was to have honked his horn. This unique opening was created, but not used in the released film because MGM studio head Louis B Mayer felt the parody would cheapen the trademark. It would turn up years later, however, in a re-release trailer for the film.    Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx Brothers (Hardcover) by Simon Louvish.

This notable cut, with several other small ones made at about the same time, is why the stated running time of the film (95 minutes) was three minutes longer than that of existing prints. 
 Monkey Business.  There is, however, a reference to the Marx brothers mother, Minnie Marx, during the stateroom scene, in which a woman asks, "Is my Aunt Minnie in here?" 

Part of the concept of casting the Marx brothers as stowaways on a ship was recycled from Monkey Business.  As Groucho Marxs and Margaret Dumonts characters are boarding the ocean liner, Dumont asks Groucho, "Do you have everything, Otis?"; Groucho replies, "Well, I havent had any complaints yet."  In two different interviews with Dick Cavett on The Dick Cavett Show - Comic Legends DVD, Groucho claimed that that exchange of dialogue was banned in a majority of states when the film was released because it was too suggestive, although the number of states varied with different tellings of the story.

===Hungarian rediscovery===
In 2008, a film student reported that the Hungarian National Film Archive possesses a longer print of the film.    While the print does not contain the opening musical number, it does contain several excised lines referencing Italy that had been cut upon the films re-release in the 1940s. With the opening number still missing, it may be that this scene was cut after its original preview screenings during the 1930s rather than during its re-release, as previously thought. However, the discovery of the Hungarian print has not yet been independently verified, and Warner Brothers, who owns the rights to the film, has not indicated that any restoration is forthcoming.

===Hidden material===
In the scene where the three stowaways are impersonating Russian aviators, Driftwood seems to talk gibberish with the dignitaries. As a matter of fact, it is English; if played backwards, it can be heard what they are saying ("This man is accusing you of being impostors", etc.). It was recorded normally, then reversed and dubbed over the scene in post-production.

==Style change== A Day at the Races. 

Another idea of Thalbergs was that before filming would commence on an upcoming picture, the Marx Brothers would try out its material on the vaudeville stage, working on comic timing and learning what earned a laugh and what did not. He was keen to plant gags accordingly so the laughs could be timed correctly.   Interestingly enough, the famous "stateroom" scene was nearly eliminated because it was not getting any laughs.  One evening the Marx Brothers threw away the script and ad-libbed the whole thing.  As a result, a weak scene was transformed into one of their all-time classics.

In A Night at the Opera, the Brothers characters were refined. Groucho made more sense, and less trouble. Chico gained intelligence, and Harpo regressed into more of a child. The film dives straight into a plot and accompanying comedy, with every scene having a definitive beginning, middle, and end. The end consisted of a grand finale in traditional MGM musical fashion, something lacking from the Brothers Paramount efforts. 

Perhaps most notably, A Night at the Opera established a formula that would be used for every subsequent film the Marx Brothers made at MGM:
* opening scene with Groucho
* a friendship created between the romantic hero and Chico
* Chico and Groucho going through several verbal routines
* Harpo joining as Chicos partner
* lush surroundings as a backdrop to the Brothers lunacy
* a fall from grace
* a rebound on a grand scale in which everything is righted 

==Reputation and legacy== Duck Soup) Paramount films."  Mark Bourne concurs: "  still let the air out of stuffed shirts and barbecue a few sacred cows, but something got lost in all that MGMness when the screens ultimate anti-authoritarian team starting working the Andy Hardy side of the street."   

Roger Ebert admits that, while A Night at the Opera "contains some of their best work," he "fast-forward  over the sappy interludes involving Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones. In Duck Soup there are no sequences I can skip; the movie is funny from beginning to end."   

Danel Griffin says: "A Night at the Opera is funny, but this is NOT the Marx Brothers, and their earlier style is so sorely missed that the film falls flat. The main problem with A Night at the Opera is the obvious lack of the Marx Brothers’ trademark anarchy. What distinguished them in their Paramount films from all other comedians was their thumb-biting indictment of society.
