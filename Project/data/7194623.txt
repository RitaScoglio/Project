==Reception==
Matt Ravier of In Film Australia gave a negative review of the film, noting " he wrong-side-of-the-tracks film is an indie staple stateside. This Australian variant doesnâ€™t succeed in updating the well-worn genre and seems happy to simply recycle the classic coming-of-age elements of more successful productions."  Margaret Pomeranz of Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABCs At the Movies provided a more favourable reception concluding that it "may not be an easy film for audiences but for me it was a tremendously moving and rewarding experience."   

==Box Office==
West grossed $57,472 at the box office in Australia.
