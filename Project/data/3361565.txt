 1981 biblical Peter the Mark and Robert Day. The film mostly shows the works of Paul, beginning with his being struck down and converted by Jesus on the road to Damascus. From there it shows his ministry to the Gentiles, gaining converts in Galatia and Greece, and eventually going to Rome for his trial. He preaches there under house arrest for two years before being executed by Nero, after which Peter arrives in Rome and continues what Paul started. The film follows the biblical narrative fairly closely, with some omissions.
