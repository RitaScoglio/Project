==Plot== Louis XV insists that the two marry.  He goes undercover as Monsieur Beaucaire, the barber of the French Ambassador, and finds that he enjoys the freedom of a commonerâ€™s life.  After catching the Duke of Winterset cheating at cards, he forces him to introduce him as a nobleman to Lady Mary, with whom he has become infatuated.  When Lady Mary is led to believe that the Duke of Chartres is merely a barber she loses interest in him.

==Reception==
Monsieur Beaucaire was part of a series of box office and critical disappointments that plagued Valentino mid-career. Although the film did fairly well in big cities, it flopped in smaller locales, and could not exceed the expensive budget Olcott put into the films production.  Historians Kevin Brownlow and John Kobal suggested that the films shortcomings stemmed more from Olcotts "pedestrian" direction. 

Many viewers and critics, perhaps expecting the more virile Valentino of his earlier films, felt that his onscreen persona with its heavy makeup, frilled attire and arch mannerisms (particularly in the first half) was overly feminized in Monsieur Beaucaire: a somewhat unfair accusation considering that much of the film satirizes the excesses of the court of Louis XV. Much of the blame for the films alleged shortcomings was assigned to Valentinos wife Natacha Rambova who was felt by many of Valentinos colleagues to have had an undue influence on the costumes, set and direction of the film. Alicia Annas wrote that audiences were most likely alienated by the general design of the film which, while historically accurate, was not tailored to 1920s American film-goers tastes. 

The hallmark of the film today, depending on what print is viewed, is Harry Fischbecks sumptuous photography. The print at the Library of Congress is probably the finest remaining example of the film.  The Stan Laurel parody Monsieur Dont Care (1924) reflected the general public attitude towards Monsieur Beaucaire.
