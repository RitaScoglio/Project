==Plot summary==
The film begins with a clip from the previous film, showing its central characters Marcellus and Diana going to be martyred for their Christian beliefs on the order of Emperor Caligula.

Demetrius in desperation prays for God to save her, and suddenly it appears that Dardanius has broken Lucias neck. All present are shocked at Lucias apparent death, especially Demetrius, and he loses all his faith in Jesus Christ as God. Previously, he had avoided killing anyone in the Emperors games, because of his Christianity|religion, but all that now changes. His next time in the arena, not only does he fight, but he ferociously kills all the gladiators that took part in the attack on Lucia. The Roman spectators, including the Emperor, are thrilled. Demetrius is freed, and allowed to join the Praetorian Guard. Caligula asks if Demetrius renounces Christ; he does, and once Demetrius does this, Caligula frees him and inducts him into the guard with the rank of Tribune.

As a Tribune, Demetrius rejects the teachings of Christ (and of Isis when encountering Messalina praying to her statue), beginning an affair with Messalina.
