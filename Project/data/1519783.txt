}} of the The Fantastic Four, was a B-movie produced by Roger Corman that ultimately went unreleased. Fantastic Four was released in the United States on July 8, 2005.

Despite being a  , was released in 2007.

==Plot== cosmic energy Ben Grimm, MIT and Susan Storm and her hot-headed ex-astronaut brother Human Torch|Johnny.

The quintet travels to  , Susan Storm can become invisible and generate impact resistant force shields, Johnny Storm can engulf himself in fire and fly unaided, and Grimm becomes a rocklike creature with superhuman strength and durability. Meanwhile, von Doom faces a backlash from his stockholders because of the publicity from the space mission, and has a scar on his face that came from an exploding control console on the station.

Grimms fiancee Debbie cannot handle his new appearance and decides to leave him. Grimm goes to brood on the Brooklyn Bridge and accidentally causes a traffic pileup while preventing a man from jumping off the bridge. Grimm, Richards and the Storms use their various abilities to contain the damage and prevent harm. The media dubs them the Fantastic Four. They move into Richards lab in the Baxter Building to study their abilities and seek a way to return Grimm to normal. Von Doom, himself mutating, offers his support but blames Richards for the failure of the spaceflight, which has lost him his company.

Richards tells the group he will construct a machine to recreate the storm and reverse its effects on them, but warns it could possibly accelerate them instead. Meanwhile von Dooms arm has become organic metal, allowing him to produce bolts of electricity, and he begins plotting revenge. He drives a wedge between Grimm and Richards, who has rekindled his relationship with Susan Storm. Using the machine, von Doom restores Ben to human form, while accelerating von Dooms condition, causing much of his body to turn to metal. Von Doom knocks the human Grimm unconscious and captures Richards.

Now calling himself Doctor Doom, he puts on a metallic mask to hide his disfigurement, tortures Richards and fires a heatseeking missile at the Baxter Building in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat Johnny Storm. Susan Storm confronts Doom but is outmatched. Grimm arrives to assist her, transformed into the Thing again by reusing the machine (speaking his signature line, "Its clobberin time!"). The battle then gets spilled into the streets and The Storms combine their powers to wrap Doom in an inferno of intense heat, and Grimm and Richards douse him with cold water, inducing thermal shock and freezing Doom in place. In an epilogue, Grimm informs Richards that he has accepted his condition with the help of Alicia Masters, a blind artist for whom he has developed feelings, and the team embraces its role as superheroes. Richards proposes marriage to Susan Storm, who accepts. Meanwhile, Dooms statue-like remains are being transported back to his homeland of Latveria when the dockmasters electronic manifest briefly undergoes electromagnetic interference, suggesting that Doom is alive.

==Production== The Fantastic trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license.    Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors had no idea of the situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release.  Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the films negative, so 20th Century Fox could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation,    as well as a possible spin-off film starring the Silver Surfer for summer 1998. 

Fox hired  , who went unaccredited for his work.

==Home release== DVD was released in December 2005. This version had some changes from the one shown in Movie theater|cinemas. Some of these changes include the following:
*There is a scene where Reed and Sue are in a storage room of the Baxter Building. On one of the shelves is a robot that is supposed to be H.E.R.B.I.E. from the Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four animated cartoon series from 1978.
 Wolverine of the X-Men comics. The actor Gruffudd breaks the fourth wall and looks directly at the camera as he does this. The extended cut includes this as part of the movie, along with a longer version of the scene in the planetarium. 

*There are no beep sounds when Dr. Doom fires his heatseeking missile.

*The theatrical version shows Doom saying "And to think I was going to spend the rest of my life with you" when attacking Sue Storm, but in the DVD version, it depicts him laughing instead.

*Three slightly modified scenes concerning the attack on Dr. Doom - one in which Reed uses his body as a funnel to direct a stream of water at Doom, one in which he does not, and one in which Doctor Dooms line "Is that the best you can do, a little heat?" is cut short, having the "..a little heat?" portion removed.

The novelization of the motion picture contains a number of scenes that were not in the final cut of the movie, including a small number that developed the character of Alicia Masters.

===Extended cut===
In June 2007, an extended cut DVD of Fantastic Four was released. It incorporated about 20 minutes of deleted scenes, and also included a preview of the sequel,  . The DVD expanded on The Things relationships with Alicia Masters, Doctor Dooms manipulations to break up the group, and the Humans Torchs womanizing, and how it backfires.
