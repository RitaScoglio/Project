  }} a legend. It features the life of a devoted ghost wife and the unsuspecting husband.

==Plot==
In a rural village west of Bangkok, Mek (Winai Kraibutr) is conscripted and sent to fight in the Siamese-Vietnamese War (1831-1834). He has to leave behind his pregnant teenage wife, Nak (Intira Jaroenpura). Mek is wounded and barely survives. He eventually returns home to his beloved wife and their child.

 
A friend visits and sees Mek living with Nak. The villagers, knowing she had died months earlier, realize Mek is spellbound by her ghost. But those who attempt to tell him are killed by Naks ghost in the night, desperate to stay with her husband. When Mek confronts Nak about the rumors, she lied and said the villagers disliked her after he left for the war. She claimed they are also telling lies about their son not being Meks. Mek believes her and lashes out at anyone who tell him she is dead.

One night, Mek finally discovers the truth. Having crawled under their house to retrieve an item, he tripped over something sticking up from the dirt. Curious, he digs it up and found a corpse and began to wonder why Nak was always preventing him from going down there. When he looked up through the creaks of the wood floor he saw Nak sitting and brushing her hair. She dropped the comb through a creak and her arm extended to retrieve it. Mek covered his mouth, so she wouldnt hear him scream and continued watching Nak. Nak picked up her crying baby and Mek saw that their son is also a corpse. It was revealed through a series of flashbacks that Nak had a difficult childbirth and both mother and child died from complications. Mek flees in terror to the local temple to hid. Nak follows him and attempts to win him back, but he is too frightened of her. The villagers attempted to drive out Nak, burning down her house and at last summoning an exorcist. Nak refuse to leave unless Mek returns to her. Mek pleas with her to leave to the netherworld. He loves her, but they cant be together since she is dead. He tells her that he is going to cut his hair and become a monk in order to pray for her sins and allow her spirit to find peace. She still refused.
