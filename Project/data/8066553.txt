The Tale of Ruby Rose is an Australian movie, released in 1988. It is 100 minutes in length. It was written and directed by Roger Scholes and produced by Andrew Wiseman and Bryce Menzies. The cast included Melita Jurisic, Chris Haywood, Rod Zuanic, Sheila Florence, and Martyn Sanderson.

==Synopsis==
In the wild and isolated wilderness of the Tasmanian highlands, Ruby Rose is overcome by her fear of darkness. Ruby cries out to the elemental spirits that surround her. She is driven to take a harrowing journey out of the mountains to seek help from her lost grandmother.

==Production==
The film was the feature film debut of Roger Scholes, a Tasmanian born film director. In the 1980s he undertook a collection of oral histories of people living in the Central Highlands of Tasmania, from which he took more than 500 photographs of places and people in the region. These became the basis of the screenplay which he first wrote in 1983. He enrolled in a filmmaking course and managed to get funds raised though Antony I. Ginnanes Film and General Holdings Company. Scholes said that of the $1.2 million raised, only $730,000 was used to make the film the rest went into fees David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p75-77  and that he only managed to make the film because Ginnane made it part of a package which included The Lighthorsemen, which is what investors really wanted to put money into.   accessed 21 November 2012 

The film was meant to be shot over six weeks, three of which took place in rugged locations. However at the end of filming only 70% of the movie had been shot, so a second unit was sent back to the location for three more weeks of filming. Several scenes were cut during filming and 12 minutes was removed in post production by the American distributors.  

==Release==
The film was screened widely at festivals throughout the world.  however Scholes was disappointed with its distribution:
 It was a disaster for me because it meant that I had no work. The problem with making films is you have got to play the game - and the game is that your first film has got to give you a bit of a shunt on. If you dont get that, youre the mercy of styles and trend. Within the bureaucratic institutions, its just like a sea, it can go one way or the other. So its taken me ten years, basically, to get to the point where the next feature film Im doing can be made.  

==Awards==
1987 Venice Film Festival, Main competition - Critics Awards:

*Winner - Best Actress   
*Winner - Best Director 
 AFI Awards.

==Reviews==
The film received generally positive reviews. Christine Cremen from The Australian described it as "a masterly evocation". Keith Connolly from The Age called it "an artistic gem". David Stratton from The Movie Show gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, describing the film as "visually magnificent". Walter Goodman from The New York Times however gave the film a negative review, describing it as "undernourished and overcooked, like the possums on which the household   survives".
