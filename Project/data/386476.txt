==Plot== con men, the brothers Matt and Darryl Diggs and their partner Mr. Jones, who trick him into helping pay for a wagon and supplies to go west, then brutally rob him and leave him and most of his belongings scattered along a deserted road in Pennsylvania.
 posse on American Indian customs and hospitality, disrupt a Trappist monasterys vow of silence with an innocent gesture of gratitude, and learn a little about each others culture.

While stopping in a small town not too far from San Francisco, Belinski encounters the Diggs brothers and Jones again. He gets into a fight with the three of them and, after taking a beating, is rescued by Lillard, who takes back what they had stolen from Belinski. Seeking revenge, the three bandits follow the pair and ambush them on a California beach where they have stopped to bathe. Belinski experiences a crisis of faith when he is forced to shoot Darryl Diggs in self-defense. Lillard restores his faith by an eloquent argument with simple language, reminding him that he still is what he is inside, despite what he had to do on the beach. 

When Matt Diggs, sole survivor of the ambushing trio, prepares to avenge his brother by killing Belinski and Lillard springs to his friends defense, Belinski regains his composure and shows his wisdom and courage in front of the entire community. He exiles Diggs from San Francisco. The film ends with Belinski marrying Rosalie Bender, younger daughter of the head of San Franciscos Jewish community, with Lillard attending the ceremony as his best man.

==Production notes==
According to Gene Wilders autobiography (Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art), the Tommy Lillard role, played by Harrison Ford, was originally planned for John Wayne. John J. Puccio of Movie Metropolis writes that Wayne was "eager to take it on as a comic follow-up to True Grit and Rooster Cogburn. Salary concerns nixed the idea, though, and its questionable he would have finished the shooting, in any case, as he died shortly before The Frisco Kid opened."   

Robert Aldrich replaced director Dick Richards during pre-production.  Roger Ebert wrote, "Its really nobodys movie. The screenplay has been around Hollywood for several years, and Aldrich seems to have taken it on as a routine assignment." 

At one point, Wilder says to Ford that Poland is right next to Czechoslovakia, but the movie is set in 1850 and neither Poland nor Czechoslovakia existed as independent nations until 1918.

==Critical reception==
The film holds a 53% rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews, with a 67% audience score.  

Vincent Canby of The New York Times described The Frisco Kid as "harmless chaos": "People keep coming and going and doing ferociously cute things, but never anything that could appeal to anyone except a close relative or someone with a built-in weakness for anything ethnic whatsoever." He criticized the lack of plot development, saying that, while based on a clever idea, The Frisco Kid ultimately fails to deliver on its promise. 

Roger Ebert gave the movie a mixed review, admitting that after seeing Cat Ballou he was "forever after spoiled on the subject of comic Westerns." "The movies based on a good idea, yes... But what approach do you take to this material? Whats your comic tone? The Frisco Kid tries for almost every possible tone."   

Jordan Hiller called it one of "25 Essential Jewish Movies", praising its "uncommon innocence and unselfconscious humility." He called it an "unpredictably paced part screwball comedy farce, part dramatic buddy picture, part spaghetti western" and wrote, "The Frisco Kid has the feel of an artist’s charmingly naive youthful indiscretion... The Frisco Kid is, all pratfalls and tuchus jokes aside, the quintessential Torah movie."  Reviewer Ken Hanke wrote, "Robert Aldrichs penultimate film is an easygoing work of some considerable charm that relies far too much on ethnic humor — mostly Jewish, but not entirely — to sit quite as comfortably as it might like...   professionalism serves the film well. Its very hard to fault on a technical level, and he brings a strong visual sense to bear on a number of sequences that raise them several notches above the TV flavor of the material. The dance sequence, when Avram and his unlikely companion, Tommy (Harrison Ford), are prisoners of a tribe of Indians, is a good case in point, as is the final shoot-out in the streets of San Francisco... Never a great movie, its nonetheless a pleasant one — an old-fashioned entertainment that more than gets by on the unforced (albeit unlikely) chemistry of Wilder and Ford."   

Puccio of Movie Metropolis called the film "humorous and touching" and "uplifting as well": "The Frisco Kid is not a great film; its not even a very good film by the best filmmaking standards; but its such a sweet and gentle film, its hard not to like... The film moseys along at a leisurely pace, and the director has a little difficulty finding the right comedic tone between dry, subtle farce and outright slapstick; yet it manages to find a soft spot in the heart for every scene, so maybe heartwarming is what Aldrich had in mind, in which case he couldnt have done better." 

Wilders performance received wide praise. Ebert wrote, "Whats poignant about the film is that Wilders performance is such a nice one. Hes likable, plucky, versatile. He is, in fact, as good an actor here as hes ever been before, and at his own brand of complex vulnerability Gene Wilder has never been surpassed."  Hanke said, "But the main interest in the film is probably Gene Wilders performance, which is interesting simply because its one of the few times that Wilder played a character that wasnt essentially Gene Wilder. And, lo and behold, he does a perfectly credible job of being someone else — or at least someone else who isnt Willy Wonka."  Film scholar Stuart Galbraith IV declares that Wilder gives "one of his very best performances" and calls his character "incredibly endearing": "The Frisco Kid is a real surprise, offering as it does one of Gene Wilders best characterizations in a film thats alternately funny and sweetly touching, this despite Robert Aldrichs generally indelicate direction."   Puccio wrote, "Nobody does nice like Gene Wilder... Nor have many actors been so willing to celebrate their culture and religious convictions as Wilder does here, perhaps also a trait he picked up from   Brooks."
