==Synopsis==
The story is told by a fish (with the voice of Pierre Lebeau).  In Quebec during the autumn of 1999, twenty-five-year-old Bibiane Champagne (Marie-Josée Croze), head of three clothing boutiques, is being crushed by the expectations put on her for being the daughter of a celebrity, Flo Fabert.  She resorts to drugs and alcohol in an effort to cope, while trying in vain to keep her problems from for example her colleague brother Philippe (Bobby Beshro) and a persistent magazine reporter (Marie-France Lambert).  The early scenes of the film show her friends supporting her through her first abortion and her inability to function in her job.
 hit and diver who was recently inspecting Manicouagan River, encounters Bibiane by surprise and she quickly poses as his late fathers neighbour.  Evian falls in love with her, and Bibiane confesses eventually that she is his fathers killer.  She helps him sort through Annsteins possessions, and in the final scene, Bibiane accompanies Evian to Lofoten to dispose of the ashes.
