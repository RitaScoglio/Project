==Plot==
National Velvet is the story of a twelve-year-old girl, Velvet Brown (Elizabeth Taylor), who lives in the small town of  Sewels in Sussex, England, who wins a spirited gelding in a raffle and decides to train him for the Grand National steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase. She is aided by a young penniless drifter named Mi (or Michael) Taylor (Mickey Rooney), who has found Mrs. Browns name and address among his late fathers effects, but is unaware of what it was doing there. Hoping to gain a bit of money from the association, Mi stays at the Browns home, but Mrs. Brown is unwilling to allow Mi to trade on his fathers good name and remains vague about how she knew him. Nevertheless she convinces her husband (Donald Crisp) to hire Mi over his better judgment, and he is brought into the home as a hired hand. It is revealed that Mi had been a jockey in Manchester, but his career ended in a collision which resulted in the death of another jockey. Since then Mi has not held a job, and he has come to hate horses. Velvets horse is named "The Pie", short for "Pirate", the epithet given him by his owner due to the horse jumping clear of his paddock and wrecking things in the village. The man decides to be rid of the Pie, and offers him up in a raffle.  Velvet wins The Pie, and on realizing the extent of the horses natural talent, she pleads with Mi to train the horse for the Grand National. He believes it a fools errand, not because of the horse, but because they have no real way to support the effort. He makes his case to Mrs. Brown, but she consents to Velvets desire to train the horse. Velvet and Mi train the horse and enter him into the race.  An experienced jockey is hired to ride him. The night before the race Velvet senses that the jockey hired to ride The Pie has no faith in him, and doesnt believe the horse can win. Velvet convinces Mi to fire the jockey, leaving them without a rider. That night Mi determines to overcome his fears and ride The Pie himself. Instead, he discovers that Velvet has slipped on the jockeys colors, and intends to ride the horse in the race herself. Aware of the dangers of such a race, Mi pleads with Velvet but is unable to dissuade her. As the race unfolds Velvet and The Pie avoid a number of falls, clear all the hurdles and win the race. Elated by their win, Velvet faints and falls off her mount at the finish. As she is revived the race doctor realizes she is not a young man, but a young woman. As such she and The Pie are disqualified, but Velvet knows The Pie proved himself.  Velvet becomes a media sensation, declining an offer of £5,000 to travel to Hollywood with The Pie to be filmed. She ran the Pie at the Grand National because he deserved to have a chance.  He wasnt an oddity to be stared at. In refusing the offer she states simply: "He wouldnt like being looked at." At the close of the film Mi takes his leave, and Mrs. Brown gives Velvet permission to reveal to him the nature of her relationship with his father. Velvet rides off to catch up with Mi and tell him that his father had been Mrs. Browns coach when she won the prize as the first woman to swim the English Channel, many years before.

The film differs from the book in a number of respects.  For example, Velvets horse is a piebald, and thus is given the name "The Piebald" or "The Pie" for short. Velvet, in the book, is a sickly child who is given to great imagination and spirit; her father is stern and given to anger, but the mother is stronger still and will stand up to him when she has to. Since her days as a swimmer she has become a large woman, and weighs 16 Stone (unit)|stone—  at the time of the story, and warns Velvet never to allow herself to be weighed down with weight.
