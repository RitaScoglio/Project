}} 1939 novel of the same title by Nathanael West. Set in Hollywood, California just prior to World War II, it depicts the alienation and desperation of a disparate group of individuals whose dreams of success have failed to come true.

==Plot== East Coast WASP Tod Hackett, an aspiring artist employed by the production department of a major studio, who also fancies Faye.
 dwarf tenderly androgynous child beckons to a man through a window and performs a grotesque imitation of Mae West.
 Waterloo battlefield extras during film within the film.  In the films climax, an enraged Homer brutally tramples a child near a Graumans Chinese Theater as crowds gather for the premiere of a new film.  Seeing this, the enraged crowd swarms over and kills Homer.  Almost immediately, the entire crowd is driven to riot, turning on itself, smashing store windows, overturning cars, trampling each other to death and turning the already packed street into a war zone.  Severely injured, a delirious Tod imagines some of the mob take on the appearance of the characters in his own grotesque painting The Burning of Los Angeles.

==Critical reception== Biblical epic epic than in something that so relentlessly ridicules American civilization . . . The movie is far from subtle, but it doesnt matter. It seems that much more material was shot than could be easily fitted into the movie, even at 144 minutes . . . It is reality projected as fantasy. Its grossness — its bigger-than-life quality — is so much a part of its style (and what West was writing about) that one respects the extravagances, the almost lunatic scale on which Mr. Schlesinger has filmed its key sequences." 

Jay Cocks of Time (magazine)|Time said, "The Day of the Locust looks puffy and overdrawn, sounds shrill because it is made with a combination of self-loathing and tenuous moral superiority. This is a movie turned out by the sort of mentality that West was mocking. 
Salts adaptation  . . . misses what is most crucial: Wests tone of level rage and tilted compassion, his ability to make human even the most grotesque mockery." 

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called it a "daring, epic film . . . a brilliant one at times, and with a wealth of sharp-edged performances," citing that of Donald Sutherland as "one of the movies wonders," although he expressed some reservations, noting, "Somewhere on the way to its final vast metaphors, The Day of the Locust misplaces its concern with its characters. We begin to sense that theyre marching around in response to the requirements of the story, instead of leading lives of their own. And so we stop worrying about them, because theyre doomed anyway and not always because of their own shortcoming." 

In the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum described the film as "a painfully misconceived reduction and simplification . . . of the great Nathanael West novel about Hollywood . . . It misses crucial aspects of the books surrealism and satire, though it has a fair number of compensations if you dont care about whats being ground underfoot - among them, Conrad Halls cinematography and . . . one of Donald Sutherlands better performances." 

Channel 4 calls it "fascinating, if flawed" and "by turns gaudy, bitter and occasionally just plain weird," adding "great performances and magnificent design make this a spectacular and highly entertaining film." 

The film was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but wasnt entered into the main competition.
