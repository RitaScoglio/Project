 federal government subsidies enabled big-name movies to be filmed in Canadian locales. Markdale residents were delighted to have Hollywood make a film in their town.

It was hoped a film set in "The Great North Country" would be a crossover hit in the U.S. and the Commonwealth, both lucrative movie markets. For reasons unknown, the film disappeared from the public eye for almost 50 years. One interesting, though unsubstantiated, rumor suggested one of the main actors wanted all traces of the film destroyed. The only known copies of the movie are an incomplete version stored at the National Archives of Canada and a complete version at the Library of Congress|U.S. Library of Congress.

Copies of the movie can be found at the Markdale Public Library, Ontario, Canada, donated by the creator of the fan site, Jeff Wilson. He, along with actors from the film. Ron Wyvill and Paul Hutton, appeared in a short documentary made by Rogers Television, Owen Sound.
