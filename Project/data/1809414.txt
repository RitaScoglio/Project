==Plot== armored truck, getting away with over a million dollars in cash.   Down-on-his-luck flower delivery truck driver and decorated former war veteran Joe Rolfe (John Payne) is accused of being involved in the heist and gets roughed up while being interrogated by the KC police.

Released due to lack of evidence Joe decides to track down the men who tried to frame him, both to clear his name and to exact revenge, and he digs up clues that lead him from Kansas City to Tijuana, and then to a tropical Mexican beach resort where Joe attempts to impersonate one of the heist guys whod been shot dead in the TJ airport on their way to split up the money.

Joe doesn’t realize that the heist was concocted by a secretive mastermind (Mr. Big) who is a disgraced former police captain who had planned the crime as revenge for being booted off the force, and to score some reward money by double crossing his own guys.

Things get complicated when Joe arrives at the resort with an intelligent and attractive young woman who has taken a serious shine to Joe, and who just happens to be the police captains daughter.

Things start to heat up as the two other robbers get wise to Joe impersonating their dead partner and start to play rough.

===Critical response===
The staff at Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine said, "With exception of the denouement, director Phil Karlson reins his cast in a grim atmosphere that develops momentum through succeeding reels. Payne delivers an impressive portrayal of an unrelenting outsider who cracks the ring.   Time magazine said the film "combines a perfect crime plot with some fair-to-middling moviemaking....  Obviously, the confidential of the title does not refer to the pictures plot, which is a very model of transparency."  Bosley Crowther of The New York Times was not a fan, writing that Kansas City Confidential "appears designed&mdash;not too adroitly&mdash;just to stimulate the curious and the cruel. The screen play by George Bruce and Harry Essex is an illogical fable of crime, the direction by Phil Karlson is routine and the leading role is bluntly acted by John Payne. Neville Brand, Jack Elam and Preston Foster do not shine in other roles, except as drab exponents of the violence that suffuses and corrupts this measly film." 
 Raw Deal, Karlson tempered the surface cynicism of his films with an underlying sense of hope."  Dave Kehr of The New York Times gave MGM Home Entertainments 2007 DVD release of the film an extensive review.  He called the release an "immeasurable improvement over what had been available":    Walking Tall (1973) and Framed (1975 film)|Framed (1975).
