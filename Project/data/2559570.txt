== Synopsis ==
The World tells the story of two workers at  ), and Taisheng (Chen Taisheng), a security guard and Taos boyfriend. As the film begins, Tao is visited by her ex-boyfriend, who is on his way to Ulan Batur. Taisheng meets Tao and the ex-boyfriend at a small diner and insists on driving him to the Beijing Railway Station. From this awkward introduction, the relationship between Tao and Taisheng grows increasingly strained. Taisheng, frustrated that Tao refuses to have sex with him, is also busy with fellow migrants from his home province of Shanxi. One, Chen Zhijun nicknamed "Little Sister," is a childhood friend of Taishengs and comes to him looking for a job. Taisheng manages to put him in touch with someone and he eventually finds work as a construction worker.
 prostitute herself in order to make enough money to see her sister, also in Ulan Batur (Tao, realizing only that Anna is upset, tries to comfort her). Later, while at a karaoke bar, Tao runs into Anna and confirms that Anna has indeed become a prostitute. Anna runs away and Tao cries, neither quite knowing what the other is thinking. As for Taisheng, he soon proves to possess a roving eye. When one of his associates asks him to drive a woman, Qun, to Taiyuan so that she can deal with her gambling brother, Taisheng agrees. Taisheng becomes enraptured with Qun shortly afterwards, and the two often meet at Quns small clothing shop. There, Qun tells Taisheng about her husband, who years before had left China for France. Since then, she has tried with some difficulty to obtain a visa to join him. Though he pursues her, Qun rejects Taishengs physical propositions.

==Production== Unknown Pleasures, in 2003 during the SARS outbreak.  The screenplay took approximately a year to write, over which time the story slowly changed, such that it became harder to distinguish the fact that it took place in Beijing, and the focus of the setting shifted to that of any large city with many migrants in it.  Filming of The World took place on location at the actual Beijing World Park, as well as at an older but similar park, Window of the World, that sometimes served as a stand-in and is located in the southern city of Shenzhen. 

=== Legitimization === Chinese Film Bureau, many felt that Jias hand would be unduly restricted by Communist bureaucrats. As it turned out, Jia claimed that the main impact of government approval was the ability to screen abroad and at home without major obstacles; Jia stated that,   Jia attributed the loosening of restrictions as part of the Film Bureaus overall liberalization and acceptance of so-called "outside directors."  Outside observers agreed with Jias assessment, dismissing claims that Jia had compromised his principles and "sold out."    One definite result of working within the system, however, was that the film became much easier to produce, as Jia no longer had to worry about interference from the central government or from local officials. 

=== Creative team=== Zhang Yang, and production houses Office Kitano and Lumen Films.  Also returning was editor Kong Jinglei, who had worked with Jia on Platform (2000 film)|Platform and would later work with Jia on Still Life and 24 City. With his core team in place, Jia also brought in several new young assistant directors. 
 diegetic music, music was an important feature to The World, which featured snippets of the dance performances that were the parks centerpieces. Music played such an important role that the film was almost considered by some to be a musical film|musical.  Jia brought in the Taiwanese composer Lim Giong, who had previously worked with Hou Hsiao-hsien, to score the film using primarily electronic music.  As stated by Jia, the artifice of the electronic music was to "signify the real emptiness of the lives of Tao and her friends. Life’s heaviness fades when confronted by the silky lightness of dance and music."  Jia then tied the music to the animated sequences of the film, wherein Taos inner thoughts were given life, all to create an "Asian digital life." 

In the cast, Jia brought back Zhao Tao, who had starred in the Jias previous ensemble pieces Unknown Pleasures and Platform, and would go on to star in both Still Life and 24 City. As usual, Jia also had a small part for his friend and classmate Wang Hongwei, who has been in nearly all of Jias films since his starring role in the short film Xiao Shan Going Home in 1995, filmed while both were still attending the Beijing Film Academy.

== Reception == Unknown Pleasures). Variety mentioned the overly long complaint in its review, as did the review by Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun Times (stating that "either you will fall into its rhythm, or you will grow restless").  Dargis, however, had fewer problems with the films pace and instead felt that Jias vision was overly insular, "mesmerized" by World Park with only fleeting glimpses of the city beyond.
