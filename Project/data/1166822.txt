After the boys become convinced that they are on the "naughty list", they travel to the North Pole to write their names on Santas "good list".  At Santas workshop, they cause much trouble, such as bumping into elves and breaking stuff, but they and the elves help clean up the mess and save Christmas.  Before they leave, they luck into an opportunity to add their names to the "good list"; however, they add Uncle Scrooges name instead, mindful of the fact that he was never written onto the list either.  On Christmas, Santa leaves them a note that explains that their actions have caused them to be put on the Good List, too.

==="Christmas Maximus"===
This story features Max Goof and Goofy celebrating the holidays. An adult Max brings home his friend Mona to meet Goofy. However, Max is unsure whether or not he wants Mona to meet his dad. Most of the story takes place within the song "Make Me Look Good". Max at first is embarrassed by his dad, who shows baby pictures to Mona, but after noticing that his scarf is made by him, he realizes that Goofy is always goofy, and that is why he loves him. Max forgets about being embarrassed and decides to join in the fun when the popcorn making machine goes haywire and causes the house to explode popcorn like a volcano and Mona reveals to have the same kind of teeth like Goofy and Max.

==="Donalds Gift"===
This story revolves around Donald Duck and his Christmas wish of peace and quiet. Daisy Duck and Huey, Dewey, and Louie also appear.  As Donald returns home from Christmas shopping, he daydreams and misses his bus.  He runs to catch after it, but he is slowed down by a series of well-wishers.  Donald becomes increasingly annoyed by the joyous people, and, at home, he is annoyed to hear the same Christmas carols on his radio.  When Daisy and his nephews arrive, Donald becomes annoyed that they want to go out so soon after he returned home, but Daisy drags him out.  Donald finds that he can not escape "We Wish You a Merry Christmas", and he inadvertently vandalizes a windows display.  After he is kicked out of the mall by a policeman, he feels guilty for his lack of Christmas spirit and helps off-key carolers.  Daisy and the boys join him, and Donald sings from his heart.

Mickey sends Pluto to the dog house. Pluto decides to run away from home and finds himself shipped to the North Pole, where the reindeer adopt him. At home, Mickey tried to apologize, only to find Pluto missing.  Mickey posts "lost dog" posters and eventually turns to a department store Santa, who turns out to be the real one.
