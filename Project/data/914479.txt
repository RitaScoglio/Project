 short — 1962 anthology Renzo Rossellini and Andrzej Wajda, as well as Truffaut.

Antoine Doinel — and Jean-Pierre Léaud, the actor who played him throughout all five films — had made his screen debut in 1959 with Truffauts first film, The 400 Blows. Truffauts tender, semi-autobiographical film about the young Antoine and his gradual descent into petty crime introduced the world to the French New Wave, a short-lived but highly influential outpouring of work from young French filmmakers including Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Éric Rohmer.

==Plot==
Antoine and Colette catches up with Antoine Doinel as a solitary 17-year-old who works at Phillips manufacturing LPs to support himself. He lives in a furnished room by himself in Place Clichy,  , Stafford, Jef.  . Turner Classic Movies website. Retrieved on 2009-04-09.  listening to opera and classical music and spending time with René (Patrick Auffay), his school friend from The 400 Blows.

One day, while attending a Berlioz Music Programme  with René, he spots Colette, a secondary school student, and falls in love for the first time.

Colette is his own age, but unlike Antoine has a warm, supportive family with whom she still lives. Antoine forms a strong friendship with Colette and, eventually, also her parents who begin to treat him as if he were a part of their family.

Colettes feelings for Antoine are at first ambiguous and, harbouring some hope that she might grow to return them, he leaves his apartment at the Place Clichy and moves into an apartment across the road from her familys. Although she continues to treat him kindly, it slowly becomes apparent that she is not interested in him romantically.  He sulks about this and at first refuses to see her, but he is lured back by a dinner invitation. It is clear that her family still consider him a surrogate son and are possibly hoping for something romantic to happen between the two teenagers.

All of these hopes are dashed, however, when the pretty Colette is met at the front door by an older man.  Her parents and Antoine look helplessly on as she disappears off with her date. They are all left to watch television. {{cite book

==Development== Renzo Rossellini and Andrzej Wajda as the other directors who would eventually participate in the project.  In his book Truffaut On Truffaut, Truffaut later said, "For my part, the French episode gave me the occasion to realize a project I hadnt dared to launch on my own, a short sequel to my first film, The 400 Blows, in which we would meet up with the young Antoine Doinel three years later having his first sentimental adventure, one that would illustrate the moral: you risk losing everything by wanting too much." 

Antoine and Colette is a largely autobiographical work, based on seventeen-year-old Truffauts infatuation with an unconventional beauty named Liliane Litvin.  . Criterion website. Retrieved on 2009-04-09.  Truffaut met Litvin at the Cinémathèque Française and quit his job as a welder and moved to Paris just to be near her. Like Antoine, he took an apartment across the street from hers so that he could monitor her activities. However, she was ultimately not interested in him nor in any of his friends (she had also attracted attention from Jean Gruault and Jean-Luc Godard).
