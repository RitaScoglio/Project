  is a 1996 Japanese animated film directed by Monkey Punch. It is the fifth feature film in the Lupin III franchise. The North American release was done by Funimation; the film is available both individually and as part of their "First Haul" box set.

==Summary== Lupin has Goemon to Inspector Zenagata shows up and put the handcuffs on Lupin but he escape with a fake hand. So Lupins gang go their different ways: Jigen:east, Goemon:west, Fujiko:south, and Lupin: north.

==Production==
Monkey Punch, the original creator of Lupin III, was the director of the film.    However, he claims it was not something he wanted to do. The production had a short deadline and as there was no director, he accepted the role. He said the experience was too demanding and claimed that it was the other people involved that "saved" the film, and added that he never wants to direct again. 

Monkey Punch originally turned down the offer to direct the movie, however he felt pressured to accept. He designed the opening and ending but the Scenario Writer filled in the rest. The assistant director made the computers look like Apple Macintosh because Monkey punch likes them.
