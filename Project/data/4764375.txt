==Production==
The movie features very few on-screen shark attacks.  However, an attack on a tourist dangling her leg in the water is very realistic and in line with documented shark attacks.  Instead of the shark taking off her whole leg, it takes out a large chunk of flesh, which later required surgical amputation.
