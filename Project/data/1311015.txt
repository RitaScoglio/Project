Noted director Werner Herzog pledged that he would eat the shoe he was wearing if Morris film on this improbable subject was completed and shown in a public theater. When the film was released Herzog lived up to his wager and the consumption of his footwear was made into the short film Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe.

Roger Ebert wrote that the film is an "underground legend," and in 1997 put it in his list of The Great Movies.
