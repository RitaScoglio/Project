First Descent is a 2005 documentary film about snowboarding and its beginning in the 1980s.

The snowboarders featured in this movie (Shawn Farmer, Nick Perata, Terje Haakonsen, Hannah Teter and Shaun White with guest appearances from Travis Rice) represent three generations of snowboarders and the progress this young sport has made over the past two decades. Most of the movie was shot in Alaska and its back country.

It is the first movie to be produced and financed by a soft-drink company .
