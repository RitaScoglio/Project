==Plot== New York, home land after years of absence.

Susetz wishes to decipher his constant feeling of failure as a human being, as a family man, as an artist. His best friends were killed in Yom Kippur War|war, his paintings were burned not without intent. He has no past and no future. 

Back home Susetz reunites with his dying father, with his mother, who unsuccessfully tries to understand her son, and with a childhood friend, Ansberg, now a philosopher/homeless.   

Ansberg has adopted unusual methods in order to bring love back to Tel-Aviv and expects "conscientious" Susetz to assist him in that. Susetz cannot be a "conscientious", or anything else for that matter, not before he resolves his own personal fate: who is he, why was he born, why does he live.

Ami Susetz decides to make a movie, about himself, his parents, his hometown Tel-Aviv, and about all that constitutes the puzzle we call human life. His movie fails in resolving the pattern but ironically becomes a commercial blockbuster. 
At the end of the day, the movie gets burned, just like the paintings, not without intent…
