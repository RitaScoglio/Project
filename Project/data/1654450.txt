==Plot==
Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) and Nisha (Karisma Kapoor) are members of a massive dance troupe. They are the best of friends, although Nisha is secretly in love with Rahul. Rahul announces his desire to direct a musical named Maya. The members of the troupe, including Nisha, have their doubts about the title character when Rahul describes "Maya" as a girl who believes in true love and waits for her prince charming who will surely turn up and take her away.Meanwhile, Pooja (Madhuri Dixit) also has a passion for dancing. Having been orphaned at a young age, she has been raised by close friends of her parents.

Pooja and Rahul have a string of near-misses while they run into each other time and again. Each of these instances is marked by a tune that registers with Pooja. Doted upon by her foster family, Pooja is soon taken to Germany by her guardians son Ajay (Akshay Kumar) who has been in London for months. Just as Ajay leaves to fly to England, he proposes to Pooja. In a dilemma, she ends up accepting it.

During rehearsals for the play, Nisha injures her leg and the doctor says she cannot dance for a few months. Rahul needs a new woman to play the lead role in the play. He comes across Pooja dancing one day and believes she is perfect for the role. He begs her to come to their rehearsals and she agrees. Rahul and Pooja become close friends. Nisha soon returns from hospital and is upset that she has been replaced. Knowing that Rahul does not reciprocate her love, she decides to leave for London. Throughout rehearsals, Rahul and Pooja find themselves falling for one another. When Rahul drops Pooja home one day, he starts whistling his tune making Pooja realize that she has fallen for the man she often heard. The next day, the two go to meet Poojas old dance tutor Tai (Aruna Irani) who believes the two are blatantly in love. At the wedding of two members of the dance troupe, Rahul and Pooja confess their love for each other but are highly awkward about it.

A few days before the premiere, Ajay arrives and tells everyone that he is Poojas fiancé. Rahul is heartbroken but tries not to show it. Nisha, who has returned, notices Rahuls devastation and explains how she too was devastated when he did not love her in return. Rahul edits the end of the play to reflect his heartbreak. On the night of the premiere, Ajay plays a recorded tape where Pooja described how she felt about Rahul, implying that Ajay thinks Rahul and Pooja are meant to be together. Pooja now realises she truly loves Rahul and the two confess their love on stage as the audience applauds them. Also, backstage, Ajay ends up asking Nisha whether she is already married or not (implying he wishes to start a relationship with her).

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
 Madhuri (though a bit chubby), Karisma, and even Akshay do a good job and Yash Chopras potentially award winning direction are just a few reasons to go watch it." 

Dil To Pagal Hai has attained classic status over the years.       Sanoobar Patel of BizAsia Showbiz wrote, "Dil To Pagal Hai really is one of those films which you cant help but fall in love with, every time you watch it. Yash Chopra showed his brilliance in bringing together some big name stars and making us adore them. An unforgettable film with some fantastic characters and an even better soundtrack… and this is what makes it an out-and-out classic."    Neha Kirpalani of businessofcinema.com stated, "The maverick director also introduced us to some very Western concepts, like Valentines Day, dance shows and plays and the concept of people in urban India dating before marriage (something that was quite uncommon in Hindi films). And yet, there were some deep-rooted Indian values in the film, like finding your soulmate and loving them for all eternity, and as Nisha proclaims, the ability to love and spend your entire life with one person until the end of time."    Ameet Bhuvan of madaboutmoviez.com observed, "Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), came at a time when Bollywood was undergoing a sea change. A churn was on in the way films were made, the way they were received and the people who were watching it. DTPH is perhaps the best example of how mainstream Hindi cinema blended to manage new tastes while still not alienating traditional likes.   

Many websites and newspapers including Yahoo! Movies, Rediff.com, CNN-IBN|IBNLive and The Times of India have listed Dil To Pagal Hai as one of the top 10 Yash Chopra films.
