As Hollywood film biographies of the period go, it takes fewer liberties with the facts than usual, and Astaire and 
Skeltons onscreen portrayal of the partnership is considered psychologically accurate,  and is complemented by a mutual chemistry, some quality acting by both, and some fine comedy touches by Skelton.   Unusually for Hollywood songwriting biographies of this period, two of the songs, "Thinking of You" and "Nevertheless", became major hits on the films release, reaching first and second place respectively, in the U.S. charts.

In recognition of his acting performance, Fred Astaire was awarded the first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy in 1951.

==Key songs/dance routines==
This film provides an object lesson in how to integrate the many songs and dances seamlessly and naturally into the script  Hermes Pan collaborated with Astaire on the choreography which takes the opportunity provided by Vera-Ellens technical prowess  to showcase dance routines notable  for leg kicks, lifts and  - Hermes Pans innovative combination of the two - the hurdling lift, first invented for "The Yam" number in Carefree (film)|Carefree (1938). These routines are contrasted with some choreographically primitive numbers typical of vaudeville c. 1920. The spirit of the partnered dances expands on the theme of marital contentment previously explored in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939) and the prior years The Barkleys of Broadway (1949). Vera-Ellens singing voice was dubbed  by Anita Ellis.
 
* "Where Did You Get That Girl?": Astaire and Vera-Ellen, dressed in top hat, white tie and tails, impersonate the vaudeville partnership of   and others, illustrates the profound evolution popular dance had undergone in the intervening period. Incidentally Ruby, working as a song plugger,  had once played tunes for the Astaire siblings. 

* "Mr. and Mrs. Hoofer At Home": A hectic and high-kicking comic dance duet for Astaire and Vera-Ellen - choreographed by Hermes Pan and featuring the hurdling lift - which is set in a suburban family living room and portrays  the various challenges of contented domesticity. The routine, which, in contrast to the previous one, is thoroughly modern  in conception, is nonetheless shown performed at the Keiths Theatre (which later became the K in RKO) in Washington, D.C. in the presence of President Woodrow Wilson, a noted vaudeville fan.  

* "My Sunny Tennessee": Astaire and Skelton deliver a version of this 1921 hit. 
 
* "So Long, OO-Long": Kalmar and Rubys 1920 oriental-themed ditty is performed by Astaire and Skelton.

* " .
 A Damsel Blue Skies (1946), - all remarkably dissimilar in execution. In the beginning of the solo, Astaire places his hat on top of a light stand and then waves to it. One year later, in "Sunday Jumps" from Royal Wedding (1951) he would take a clotheshorse into his arms and dance with it. 

* "Come On, Papa": Another high-kicking song and dance routine, this time for Vera-Ellen and chorus of sailors, to a 1918 song by Ruby and Edgar Leslie. 

* "Nevertheless (Im in Love with You)": Kalmar and Rubys 1931 song is performed on stage by Astaire and Vera-Ellen to Skeltons piano accompaniment.

* "All Alone Monday": Gale Robbins delivers a performance of Kalmar and Rubys 1926 ballad.

 Latin and ballroom dance styles, which he had first been inspired to undertake during his celebrated partnership with Rita Hayworth. After this departure - which illustrates the passion than can continue to flourish long after the married nuptials - the dance subsides into a tender coda, recalling its opening mood.      

* "I Love You So Much":  Arlene Dahl, accompanied by a chorus of top-hatted men, sings and dances her way through  this number originally written  for the 1930 film version of The Ramblers (later retitled The Cuckoos).
                                                  
* "Medley (incl. Three Little Words)": In this closing scene, Astaire and Skelton perform a medley of most of the songs featured in the film, ending with "Three Little Words" - Kalmar having finally found a suitable lyric for Rubys melody, a running gag throughout most of the film.

==Contemporary reviews==
*The New York Times, August 10, 1950: "There is a special quality about the new picture...which deserves immediate mention in detail. That is the polished performance of Fred Astaire as Bert Kalmar... Mr. Astaire has been wearing out thin-soled dancing shoes at a great pace over the years while most of us have grown a little heavier and somewhat slower of foot. But, he hasnt changed. Still lithe in appearance, Mr. Astaire has drawn rich dividends from time and is dancing in peak form...In talking of the fine dancing contributed by Mr. Astaire we forgot to mention how engagingly they carry off the romantic interest and bust into song when the script demands it." {{cite book

*Variety (magazine)|Variety, July 12, 1950: Stal.:"For Astaire, its unquestionably his best picture in sometime. His terping, as always, is tops, his singing is adequate and his characterisation of Kalmar, while never deeply-etched, does full justice to the late songwriters many talents...Vera-Ellen, with this picture, becomes the undisputed premiere danseuse of the screen. She matches Astaire tap for tap...and looks to be the best partner hes ever had."
