To punish Jeeva, Kirans father frames his mother (Farida Jalal) and two sisters for prostitution and bribes the police into arresting them, which leads to the three of them committing suicide.

Kiran Bali (Rani Mukherji) is the youngest daughter of the family and strongly dislikes them. She tries to befriend Jeeava many times, but he is too engrossed in his killing to have any time for her. One day, Kiran is in Jeevas apartment delivering milk to him. Whilst she is there, Khatri and his men break into the Balis apartment and kill them all - Kiran is the only one to survive as she was in Jeevas apartment.
