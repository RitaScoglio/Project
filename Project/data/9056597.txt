==Production== wushu champions gathered together in Shandong where the director and animators flew to learn more about the diversity of martial arts for the film. Although DragonBlade was completely made in Hong Kong, the film was originally animated and lip-synced to English first. This is because it is technically easier to dub from English to Cantonese than the other way around. 
 MTR transportation service promoted the movie with a Dragonblade octopus card.  Since this movie is the first 3D-CG film fully rendered in Hong Kong, the card is now a rare collectible item.

The idea of using "outtakes" (better known as "NG"s in Hong Kong) during the end credits was used by the director as a homage to Jackie Chan films.

==Awards and nominations==
