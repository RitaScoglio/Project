==Plot== traumatized during an unnamed war, leading to a pathological fear of flying. As a result, he is unable to hold a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty), now a flight attendant, leaves him. Striker nervously boards a Boeing 707 (Trans American Flight 209) from Los Angeles to Chicago on which she is serving, hoping to win her back, but she rebuffs him.
 food poisoning from the fish. The cockpit crew, including pilot Clarence Oveur (Peter Graves) and co-pilot Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), have also been affected, leaving no one to fly the plane. Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower for help, and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the planes autopilot, a large inflatable pilot doll (listed as "Otto" in the end credits), which will get them to Chicago, but will not be able to land the plane. Rumack convinces Ted to fly the plane, though Ted feels unable to handle the pressure and the unfamiliar aircraft.

McCroskey knows that he must get someone else to help take the plane down and calls Rex Kramer (Robert Stack). Kramer was Teds commanding officer in the war, and despite their hostile relationship he would be the best choice to instruct Striker. As the plane nears Chicago, Ted is overcome by stress and can land the plane only after a pep talk from Dr. Rumack. With Kramers advice, Ted is able to land the plane safely with only minor injuries to some passengers. Teds courage rekindles Elaines love for him, and the two share a kiss. "Otto" takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female companion.

==Production== Jerry Zucker, David Zucker (collectively known as Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker|ZAZ), wrote Airplane! while they were performing with the Kentucky Fried Theatre, a successful small theatre they founded in 1971. To obtain material for comedy routines, they routinely recorded late night television and reviewed the tapes later primarily to pull the commercials, a process Abrahams compared to "seining for fish".    During one such taping process, they unintentionally recorded the 1957 film Zero Hour!, and while scanning the commercials, found that the film was a "perfectly classically structured film" according to Jerry Zucker.   Abrahams later described Zero Hour! as "... the serious version of Airplane!". It was the first film script they wrote, completed around 1975,  and was originally called The Late Show. The script originally stayed close to the dialog and plot of Zero Hero!, as ZAZ recognized they did not a good understanding of film at the time to structure a proper script.  ZAZs script borrowed so much from Zero Hero! that they believed they needed to negotiate the rights to create the remake of the film and assured they remained within the allowance for parody within copyright law. They were able to obtain the rights from Warner Bros. and Paramont for about $2,500 at the time.  The original script contained spoofs of television commercials but people who proofread the script advised them to shorten the commercials, and, eventually, ZAZ removed them. When their script was finished they were unable to sell it.   

The trio knew director John Landis, who encouraged them to write a film based on their theatre sketches. They managed to put the film, called The Kentucky Fried Movie, in production in the late 1970s, and entered a movie set for the first time. David Zucker explains: "  It was the first time we had ever been on a movie set. We learned a lot. We learned that if you really wanted a movie to come out the way you wanted it to, you had to direct. So on the next movie, Airplane!, we insisted on directing."  
 
Filming took 34 days,  mostly during August 1979. Zucker stood beside the camera during shooting, while David Zucker and Abrahams would be watching the video feed to see how the film would look; they would confer after each take.   

During filming, Leslie Nielsen used a fart toy to keep the cast off-balance. Hays said that Nielsen "played that thing like a maestro".   

===Casting===
David Zucker explained that "the trick was to cast actors like  , who was a co-star of Angie (TV series)|Angie, and Julie Hagerty to round out the cast, whom the directors advised to play it straight. 

The films writers and directors, as well as members of their family, showed up in cameo appearances. David and Jerry appear in the beginning as the two ground-crew members who accidentally cause a 747 to taxi into a terminal window. Abrahams is one of many religious zealots scattered throughout the film. Charlotte Zucker (David and Jerrys mother) is the woman attempting to apply makeup in the plane while it experiences turbulence. Their sister Susan Breslau is the second ticket agent at the airport. Jim Abrahams mother is the woman initially sitting next to Dr. Rumack.
 jive and The Poseidon The Towering California Proposition NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar plays co-pilot Murdock, who is later revealed in dialogue to actually be Abdul-Jabbar living a secret double life. In the DVD commentary the Zuckers and Jim Abrahams revealed that Kareem Abdul-Jabbars role of co-pilot Roger Murdock was originally intended for baseball star Pete Rose. Due to Roses schedule and his commitment to baseball, he had to decline the role.

For the "red zone/white zone" send-up of curbside terminal announcements—in which public address announcers "Betty" and "Vernon" argue over the red and white zones, ZAZ went through the usual process of auditioning professional voice actors, but failed to find ones who could provide the desired verisimilitude. Instead, the filmmakers ultimately sought out and hired the real-life married couple who had recorded the announcement tapes which were then being used at LAX.   

===Score===
In 1980 an LP soundtrack for the film was released by Regency Records, and included dialog and songs from the film. It was also narrated by Shadoe Stevens, and only featured one score track, the "Love Theme from Airplane" composed by Elmer Bernstein. The soundtrack was altered for the European Flying High release, with several of the featured tracks swapped for pieces original to the LP.

On April 28, 2009 La-La Land Records announced that it would release the first official score album for Airplane!, containing Bernsteins complete score. 

The soundtrack was released digitally on February 19, 2013, by Paramount Music.  

==Release==
Before its release, the directors had been apprehensive due to a mediocre response at one of the pre-screenings. But the film earned its entire budget of about $3.5 million in its first weekend of release. Overall, it earned more than $83 million in box office gross for $40 million in rentals,  making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 1980.

Based on 56 reviews, compiled retrospectively Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 98% judging it "Certified Fresh."  The consensus on the site reads "Though unabashedly juvenile and silly, Airplane! is nevertheless an uproarious spoof comedy full of quotable lines and slapstick gags that endure to this day."

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote "Airplane! is sophomoric, obvious, predictable, corny, and quite often very funny. And the reason its funny is frequently because its sophomoric, predictable, corny, etc".  Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote "Airplane! is more than a pleasant surprise... As a remedy for the bloated self-importance of too many other current efforts, its just what the doctor ordered".  In 2008 Airplane! was selected by Empire (magazine)|Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.  It was also placed on a similar list by The New York Times, a list of The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made.
