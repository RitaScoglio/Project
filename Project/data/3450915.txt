Raising funding for the film was difficult at first, as Irving had to find individual donors.  The proceeds from a fundraiser, in which Bittner gave a presentation to a packed theater, allowed Irving to start shooting the film in earnest.   

The musical score was created by Chris Michie, a Bay area musician, formerly the guitarist for Van Morrison.  It was his final project before he died from melanoma.  The film, which he did not live to see released, is dedicated to him.
