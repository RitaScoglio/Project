== Reception ==
The movie received negative reviews from some critics, who considered it little more than a 96-minute commercial for Nintendo games and Universal Studios Hollywood. Roger Ebert called it "a cynical exploitation film with a lot of commercial plugs" and "insanely overwritten and ineptly filmed".
