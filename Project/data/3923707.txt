 1948 film loosely based on the creative partnership of the composer Richard Rodgers and lyricist Lorenz Hart. The film stars Mickey Rooney as Hart and Tom Drake as Rodgers, along with Janet Leigh, Betty Garrett, Ann Sothern and numerous musical stars. 
 sanitized Harts complex psychological problems and self-destructive behavior, which led to the break-up of the writing partnership and contributed to Harts early death.  Further, while understandable for its time, the film also completely avoided any mention of Harts homosexuality.

The beginning of the film is somewhat unusual for a biopic.  Drake appears alone in character, introducing himself to the audience as Richard Rodgers and then introducing the story. Its as if Rodgers were playing himself. 

Though the film performed very well at the box office, it proved to be quite an expensive production and, as a result, barely recouped its cost in its first release. H.
