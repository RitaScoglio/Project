==Production==
The making of Swamiji spanned six years, starting from Manick Sorcars visit to the Art Institute of Chicago in 2006,    when he was inspired to make the laser documentary on the philosopher-monk and started doing research on the subject with the help of the Art Institute library and the State Government of Illinois. The following years entailed research, building the storyboard, and developing the corresponding 3D special effects. The final production incorporated several color lasers, animation and atmospherics synchronized with intelligent lighting, haze machines, and surrounding sound system to present the mystical life story of the great monk. The objective of the unique laser show was to relive and spread the message of Swami Vivekananda of the 19th century in the light of the 21st century.

There are two songs in it. The lyrics for "Mano Chalo Nijo Niketane" were written by Ajay Udayanath Pakrashi and sung by Anindya Basu; and the lyrics for "Prabhuji Mero Awagun Chit Na Dharo" were written by Surdas, and sung by Durga Rahul.

In a review of the show in Delhi, Ramakrishna Mission, Delhi wrote: "It is difficult to express in words the quality of production. Apart from the very impressive display of laser technique, what really gladdened our hearts was the accuracy, authenticity and the appropriate nature of the choice of incidents, music, narration, etc...It gives wonderful glimpse of his work in the West as well as in India. It highlights some of the most important and soul-stirring messages of Swamiji. In our view the Western audience would appreciate the show even more because Swami Vivekanandas message of harmony has been beautifully highlighted."

Voice of Asia TV News wrote: "A pencil torch emitting laser light turned into a magic wand and the magic of light brought to life the ever green story of a world famous monk, known as Swami Vivekananda. The expectant audience, unfamiliar with the technique of laser show, was perhaps looking for a miracle and miracle, indeed, occurred as ships sailed, trains arrived, men and women walked and children played, all walks of life continued, bound and shaped by sheer light…The art of cartoon and animation reached its zenith in the hands of the reputed Laserist Manick Sorcar."
