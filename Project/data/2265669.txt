== Plot ==
 
 Armistice through 18th Amendment Prohibition period 1929 stock the 21st Amendment brought an end to the Prohibition era.
 bootlegging business Priscilla Lane), who is now an adult - a girl he formerly corresponded with during the war while she was in high school - working at a nightclub. Eddie gives her a job singing in Hendersons cabaret, where Panama is hostess.  Eddie wants Jean as his wife, but she does not return his affections.
 Paul Kelly) who had refused to cooperate with him.  In charge of the liquor shipment on board is George who proposes to Eddie to bring him in as a partner.  Eddie agrees, and back home they tip off the Feds of a liquor shipment of Browns that is then confiscated.  Eddie, George, and their henchmen raid the Feds warehouse stealing the liquor.  As they are leaving, George recognizes one of the watchmen as his former sergeant that he disliked and murders him.  After learning of the murder, Lloyd quits while being threatened by George. In time, as the bootlegging rackets prosper, Eddie sends Danny to arrange a truce between him and Brown, but Dannys life-less body is dropped off in front of Hendersons. Eddie and his henchmen plan a surprise visit to Browns establishment, but George, uncomfortable with Eddies increasing authoritarian manners, tips off Brown, who sets a trap.  A gunfight ensues, and Eddie kills Brown while escaping.  Figuring out Georges duplicity, he dissolves their partnership.  

While being in love with Jean, Eddie is surprised when she tells him of her plans to marry Lloyd. Subsequently, after speculating in the stock market, Eddies bootlegging empire crumbles in the 1929 crash.  He sells his fleet of cabs to George, who mockingly leaves Eddie one to drive, like the cab he drove at the end of the Great War after losing his job at the garage. As by chance one day, Jean steps into Eddies cab. Eddie is upset at her for leaving him for Lloyd, so hes standoffish. Jean invites him back to her house to help Lloyd with a problem that he has with George.  Now in the District Attorneys office, Lloyd has received a death threat from George unless he stops working on the case in which George murdered his former sergeant.  Eddie is introduced to their 4 year-old son, but he refuses to help Lloyd, and he agrees to be friends with them and leave it at that.

Jean tries a second time to ask Eddie for help.  She locates him at a bar with Panama.  After appealing to a drunken Eddie, he agrees to go to Georges house.  While there, Eddie is mocked again by George for his shabby looks and cannot convince him to lay off Lloyd. This results in a shootout in which Eddie kills George ("Heres one rap ya wont beat...") and some of his men, redeeming himself. After running outside, he is shot in the back by another cohort, and collapses on the steps of a nearby church. As the police arrest the remainder of Georges gang, Panama runs to Eddie, and being interviewed by a cop while she cradles Eddies lifeless body, she informs the officer, "He used to be a big shot."
