On a trip to Chennai, Sivagiri rescues a court witness from Pattasu Balu (Pasupathy), a don dominating central Chennai.

He also calls the commissioner and warns him that he will kill all the thugs of Chennai as the police department fails in their duty. Later on, Sivagiris friend Veluchamy who is also an inspector, comes to know about this. Sivagiri challenges Veluchamy that he will give up his mission if the latter keeps any one thug of Chennai in jail at least for a single day. Veluchamy not only fails in his mission but also loses his son as he was killed by Pattasu Balu, the head of the thug who got arrested.

This harsh lesson makes Veluchamy to help Sivagiri. Thus, Veluchamy lists Sivagiri the entire mafia network of Chennai by providing the specification of who leads the various areas. Sivagiri write their names in papers and randomly chooses Pattasu Balu. He goes and kills Pattasu Balu, stating that he is not killing instead clearing.

Then, one day, Shuba meets Sivagiri in a temple and finds that he is not working in any cloth manufacturing company. But still, Sivagiri manages to make Shuba believe that he is working in a travels company. Thus, Shuba gets a promise from Sivagiri that he should meet her and spend time with her quite frequently.

Later on, Sivagiri provokes Panparak Ravi to kill his own brother by sticking the funeral posters of Ravi and making him think that his brother is the person who is killing people all over Chennai. After the death of Ravis brother, Ravi hides himself in a politicians house to be away and safe from the hands of police. That politician damages his own car and house by his henchmen and makes the police to believe that someone has attacked his house. Thus, the police decide to provide security for the politician. This makes Ravi feel happy, considering that Sivagiri cant come to his place by fooling all these inspectors and kill him. Then, Sivagiris friend inspector Veluchamy found out that Ravi is hiding in the politicians place. (He found out from the politicians servant that walks in but brings tobacco).

Sivagiri wants Veluchamy to help by disband the police protection but Veluchamy refused because that is police responsibilities to protect. He can only informs Sivagiri and Sivagiri have to kill Ravi.

===Reviews===
The film received positive reviews.  Behindwoods wrote: "Another tailor-made role for Vijay, Tiruppachi scores with its impressive screenplay. Although the story is the perennial tear-jerker of a brothers affection for his sister, the packaging will attract the audience".  Indiaglitz wrote: "It is a film for Vijays fans who love their star to dance with energy, fight with enthusiasm and love with mischief. He does all this in his usual style. Punchline dialogues, songs glorifying hero find their place in all throughout the movie".  While another critic wrote: "Unlike usual masala movies that serve up sentiments and action alternately, Thiruppaachi makes a clean break between the two. Its first half, which is entirely setup, is devoted entirely to comedy and sentiments with not even a single stunt sequence. But once action rears its head after the intermission, there is no respite from it apart from the obligatory duets. It is one violent fight after the other until the final credits roll. It is to director Perarasus credit that both halves maintain our interest in spite of the dedication to a particular aspect".  Sify wrote:"Vijay has stuck to his regular formula - five songs, flying fights, crass comedy, punch line dialogues, dream songs in foreign locales and corny sentiments. So if you have seen earlier films of the superstar you may strive hard to find anything new in Tirupachi, which is old wine served in a new bottle, with a different label. 

===Box-office=== Ayya and with dhanush starrerDevathayai Kanden. The film opened up to full houses with 80 percent occupancy from Chennai and other districts of the state.
