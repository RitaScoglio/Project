 Neville Smith, private eye of the kind he knows from films and pulp novels. Having put an advertisement in a local newspaper (the Liverpool Echo) as a birthday present to himself, Ginley is suddenly contacted for what appears to be an actual piece of detective work...

The film has many comic moments as it switches between detective novel and affectionate Parody|spoof. It has some shots of Liverpool buildings that have long since been demolished, including the employment exchange on Leece Street.
 The Odessa Sunset Boulevard (1993).

Several scenes in the London part of the narrative take place in and around Paul Bruntons famous occult bookstore, The Atlantis Bookshop.

Despite its relatively lightweight tone, Frears film is not without its contentious moments. TV broadcasts are nowadays rare because of Ginleys use of racist language and insults (such as calling a black African character "Mighty Joe Young" and a "spade" â€” see list of ethnic slurs). Another scene was significantly (and clumsily) shortened before release because of its detailed depiction of a heroin-user preparing and taking his fix.

After years of unavailability, Gumshoe was released on DVD in 2009.
