Storm Boy is a 1976 Australian film based on a Storm Boy (novel)|childrens book, by Colin Thiele, about a boy and his pelican.

==Plot==
Storm Boy (Greg Rowe) likes to wander alone along the fierce deserted coast of South Australias Coorong, near the mouth of the Murray River. He and his father live a reclusive life among the dunes that face out into the Southern Ocean. After a pelican mother is shot, Storm Boy rescues three chicks; he names them Mr Proud, Mr Ponder and Mr Percival, and nurses them back to health. His father, known to some as Hideaway Tom, forces Storm Boy to release the birds, but Mr Percival returns. The boy and the pelican form a special bond.  Mr Percival is shot by hunters and dies. The story also looks at the conflict between Storm Boys lifestyle and the externally imposed requirement for him to attend school.

Storm Boys real name in the film is Mike—the moniker "Storm Boy" was given to him by Fingerbone Bill (David Gulpilil), an Aboriginal man who becomes his friend.
