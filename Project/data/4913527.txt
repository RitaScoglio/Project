==Plot==
The film opens with a captive woman who is forced to breed mutant children giving birth to stillborn. She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Some time later, a group of scientists working in the hills of the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch (Jason Oettle).
 Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film).  The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and  Amber (Jessica Stroup).

The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another mutilated and dying scientist from beneath the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitters friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down.

The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way to escape the hills is through the mines. After the group kills Stabber, Missy (Daniella Alonso) is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon (Derek Mears), who attempts to rape her. Missy fights him off only to be captured by Hades, who drives Chameleon away and savagely rapes Missy himself. The remaining troops attempt to rescue her, with the exception of Stump (Ben Crowley), who is killed by Letch while attempting to climb down the hill without ropes. After being separated from Crank (Jacob Vargas) and Delmar (Lee Thompson Young),  Napoleon and Amber cross paths with Chameleon, who they manage to kill. They later locate a non-violent mutant named Hansel (David Reynolds), while escaping Grabber (Gaspar Szabo). Grabber is killed by Crank and Delmar after shooting the latter. Delmar eventually dies from his wounds, and Hansel leads Napoleon, Amber and Crank to the exit. Along the way Crank is killed by a trapped crate of dynamite that he attempts to take with him, incidentally triggering an explosion.

After killing Letch, Napoleon and Amber find the captive Missy, and all three fight Hades, who they manage to kill as well. The three leave the mines, but are watched by an unknown mutant using their surveillance equipment.

==Production== previous movie was filmed.  The alternate title was The Hills Have Eyes 2: The Hills Still Have Eyes.
 The Hills Have Eyes, joins the National Guard to overcome her fears. Barely finished with basic training, Brenda receives a call from her sergeant, who explains that they are sending a team back to the New Mexico desert to eradicate the remaining mutants. Her sergeant and the team need her, for she is the only one left alive who knows the mutants location. Because of de Ravins involvement in the television show Lost (TV series)|Lost, her schedule was unable to accommodate the filming of the sequel. Wes Craven replaced her character, but retained much of the original concept, including the group of National Guard soldiers in training.   

A one-minute   was released on December 12, 2006. The teaser featured "Insect Eyes," a song by indie folk recording artist Devendra Banhart. In addition to that, a series of clips with an introduction by Wes Craven and a small gallery can be found on the   website. Also on Fox Atomic is a soundless clip of the mutant Grabber attacking Amber. Later on a full length trailer and two clips were released to  .

Craven originally looked at Michael J. Bassett, the director of Deathwatch (2002 film)|Deathwatch, to take over the directing role, but ultimately chose Martin Weisz after scheduling conflicts with Bassett.
