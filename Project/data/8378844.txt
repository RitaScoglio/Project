Three Little Beers is the 11th short subject starring American slapstick comedy team the Three Stooges. The trio made a total of 190 shorts for Columbia Pictures between 1934 and 1959.

==Plot==
  fairy tale "The Three Bears"   ]] Gainfully employed in the delivery department of the Panther Pilsner Beer company (a reference to the derogatory slang term, characterizing poor quality beer as "panther piss"),  the Stooges suffer several mishaps while loading the back of their truck with a six-barrel tall stack of beer barrels. After learning of a golf tournament their company is sponsoring, in which cash prizes will be awarded, the boys  quickly drive off to the Rancho Golf Club. To gain access they impersonate reporters by using knobs torn from bathroom fixtures as press badges. The ruse barely succeeds—Moes and Larrys are marked "press", but Curlys reads "pull". Once inside, the Stooges steal some golfers clothes, and split up to practice—although they know absolutely nothing about golf.

Curly gets his golf ball stuck in the tree and decides the only way to retrieve it is by chopping the tree down. Moe finds an open area to practice, but the only thing that he hits is the ground, which is soon pockmarked with hundreds of Glossary_of_golf#Divot|divots. Larry practices putting, but a root gets in his way, and he tears up the putting green in his efforts to extract the seemingly endless root. All of this destruction is noticed by the two outraged and angry Italian groundskeepers, who complain to management and send police in pursuit of the trio. 

The Stooges escape in their beer truck. As they drive up a steep hill, two barrels fall off the truck and roll away. Parking the truck, the Stooges give chase but to no avail. It gets worse when the parked trucks brake loosens and the truck rolls into a curb, jarring loose the rest of the barrels which head downhill as well—directly toward the Stooges, who are hurled into a freshly laid sidewalk of wet cement.

==Production notes== Beverly Hills, 20th Century Echo Park Avenue in Los Angeles. This is the second of sixteen Stooge shorts with the word "three" in the title.   

==In popular culture== 2012 Three Stooges film:
* Moe smacks Larry, and Larry cries "My neck!", then Moe slaps him again and asks "How does it feel now" and Larry replies "All right," then Moe slaps him yet again and says "Thats good. Cmon on! Whats the matter with you?".
* In a deleted scene on the DVD release, Curly is washing his clothes on the golf course (the original scene from 1935 featured Curly using a ball washer for laundering his clothes). Moe is about to smack Curly, but Larry butts in and asks whats going on. Moe tries to poke Larrys eyes, but Curly stops him. Moe then slaps Curly. He turns to Larry, who has his eyes covered. Moe smacks the top of Larrys head, Larry opens his hand, and Moe pokes his eyes, this continues twice. Moe sets up his fist, Curly smacks, Moe begins the around-the-world bop (or "hand-to-hand head clunk"), hitting Larrys chin in the process, then hitting Curlys head.
