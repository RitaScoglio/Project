}} James Tien. The film also features Yuen Biao as the Master of the Five Fists. Chan was also the films stunt co-ordinator. It was known in some releases as Karate Ghostbuster.

Along with Dragon Fist, Spiritual Kung Fu was filmed in early 1978. As Lo Weis studio went bankrupt was running out of money, they shelved both films due to cost-cutting measures and Chan was loaned out to Seasonal Films for a 2 picture deal. Whilst there he made Snake in the Eagles Shadow and Drunken Master with Yuen Woo-ping. {{cite web

Spiritual Kung Fu was Lo Weis response to Chans earlier attempt at blending comedy with kung fu in the film Half a Loaf of Kung Fu. The supernatural elements of the film were brought to life by some early examples of Hong Kong special effects. Much of the scripted comedy in the film centred on Chans exaggerated facial expressions and reactions to his ghostly teachers.

==Plot synopsis== Shaolin Temple. An anonymous thief steals a book from the library which teaches a potentially fatal style of Kung Fu. Yi-Lang, along with a group of five other monks, is punished for not stopping the thief, but his bravery leads to him signing up to defend a supposedly haunted portion of the school. 

Upon discovering the ghosts, who are masters of a supposedly lost style of fighting known as The "Five Style Fists", Yi-Lang offers himself as a student, masters the form and uses it to progress quickly through the ranks of the school. In order to defend the school against the very thief who stole the book from its library, Yi-Lang demonstrates his new style and defeats the invading troup, with a little help from his five spiritual masters.

==Versions==
* The film was recorded in Mandarin in early 1978 but shelved. Prior to its belated theatrical release late that year, it was over-dubbed with a Cantonese soundtrack and some small edits were made. It wasnt until 1980 that the film was finally given a release with the original Mandarin soundtrack.
 Fortune Stars library contains the visual content of the Mandarin version, but they have (erroneously) provided the Cantonese soundtrack to distributors such as Universal Japan and Hong Kong Legends.

* The Korean theatrical version contains a completely different opening.
