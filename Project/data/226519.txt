The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is a 1958 Technicolor fantasy film from Columbia Pictures, produced by Charles H. Schneer and directed by Nathan H. Juran. This was the first of three Sinbad feature films from Columbia, the much later two being The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger). All three Sinbad films were conceptualized by Ray Harryhausen who used a full color widescreen stop-motion animation technique he created called Dynamation.

==Plot== magic lamp to the monster. Despite his desperate pleas to Sinbad to return him to the island, Sinbad refuses, since he is carrying Princess Parisa (Kathryn Grant) aboard, with whom he has fallen in love and their marriage meant to secure peace between her fathers realm and Sinbads homeland Persia.

In order to make the journey, Sinbad recruits additional sailors from among the convicts in the Caliphs prisons. Before they reach the island of Colossa, the cutthroats mutiny and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and his men. During a storm, the sounds of screaming demons from an island south of Colossa madden the crew and the ship is in danger of being dashed upon the rocks. After the leader of the mutineers falls from the mast to his death, one of the mutineers releases Sinbad so he can save the ship.

On the island of Colossa, Sinbad, Sokurah and some of the sailors enter the valley of the Cyclops, where they find a treasure hoard but are captured by the monster. Sokurah abandons Sinbad and his men to regain the lamp, but is trapped by the Cyclops. With Parisahs aid, Sinbad escapes, blinds the Cyclops and lures it off the edge of a cliff to its death. With Sokurahs treachery revealed, Sinbad retains custody of the lamp until Parisah is turned back to normal.
 Genie of the lamp, Barani (Richard Eyer), who tells her how to summon him in return for his eventual freedom. The parent Roc returns and attacks the men in retaliation, slaying several of them. Sinbad manages to retrieve both a fragment of an eggshell and the lamp, but is captured by the Roc, who drops him unconscious in its nest. Admist the confusion, the magician kills Sinbads faithful aide Harufa (Alfred Brown), abducts the tiny Princess and takes her to his underground fortress.
 skeleton warrior to slay them. Sinbad destroys the skeleton, however, and as he and Parisah make their way out of the cave, they honor their promise to the Genie and destroy his lamp to set him free.

When the two leave the cave, they encounter another Cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, who forces the cyclops out of the cave and kills it. Sinbad and Parisa make good their escape back to the shore. Sokurah orders the victorious dragon to follow and kill them, but Sinbads men have had time to prepare the giant crossbow. The dragon is mortally hit by Sokurahs own invention, and the magician is accidentally crushed by the falling monster while Sinbad, Parisa, and the other survivors depart. They are joined by Barani, Sinbads new cabin boy, who has placed the treasure of the Cyclops in Sinbads cabin as a wedding gift.

==Production==
It took Ray Harryhausen 11 months to complete the full color, widescreen stop-motion animation sequences for The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. Harryhausens "Dynamation" label was used for the first time on this film. 

Harryhausen gave the Cyclops a horn, furry goat legs, and cloven hooves, an idea based upon the concept of the Greek god Pan (mythology)|Pan. He lifted much of the creatures design (for example the torso, chest, arms, poise and style of movement) from his concept of the Ymir (the Venusian creature from his earlier 20 Million Miles to Earth). He used the same armature for both figures; to do this, he had to cannibalize the Ymir, removing the latters latex body.

Harryhausen researched the Cobra-woman sequence (when Sakourah entertains the Caliph and the Sultan) by watching a belly dancer in Beirut, Lebanon. During the performance, Harryhausen says, "smoke was coming up my jacket. I thought I was on fire! It turned out the gentleman behind me was smoking a hookah!" The Cyclops is the films most popular character, but Harryhausens personal favorite was the Cobra-woman, a combination of Princess Parisas maid, Sadi, and a cobra. 

The films original script had a climax that involved two Cyclops fighting. In the final version, however, the climactic battle featured a single Cyclops versus a Dragon. The model of the Dragon was more than three feet long and was very difficult to animate; the fight sequence took nearly three weeks for Harryhausen to complete. Originally, it was planned to have the Dragon breathing fire from its mouth during the entire sequence, but the cost was deemed too high. So the scenes where it does breathe fire, Harryhausen used a flamethrower, shooting out flames 30 to 40 feet against a night sky, then superimposeing the filmed fire very near the Dragons mouth. 
 Jason and the Argonauts. 
 Clash of the Titans.

==Score== Mysterious Island, Jason and the Argonauts, but Harryhausen regarded the score for The 7th Voyage of Sinbad as being the finest of the four due to the empathy which Herrmanns main title composition displayed for the subject matter. 

The soundtrack producer Robert Townson, who re-recorded the score in 1998 with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, described the music as rich and vibrant, commenting "I would cite The 7th Voyage of Sinbad as one of the scores which most validates film music as an art form and a forum where a great composer can write a great piece of music. As pure composition I would place Sinbad beside anything else written this century and not worry about it being able to stand on its own." 

==Reception==
The 7th Voyage of Sinbad was, and continues to be, well-reviewed by critics and audiences alike, with many saying that it is the best film of the "Sinbad" trilogy.  It has a 100% rating at the aggregate movie review website Rotten Tomatoes,  with several reviewers citing its nostalgic value.  Mountain Xpress critic Ken Hanke calls it "Childhood memory stuff of the most compelling kind."
