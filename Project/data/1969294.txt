Later that night, a drunken Mother assaults Murdoch for stating that Leroys death "doesnt count"; though Murdoch states this in regard to the drivers "dead body" pool, Mother perceives it as an attack on the character of his dead partner.

All of Unitys and F+Bs ambulances descend on the F+B garage; upon arrival, Murdoch opens fire and hits Speed in the shoulder.  When Mother charges onto the garage grounds to rescue his ambulance, he comes face to face with Murdoch; Murdoch tries to shoot Mother, but his gun is empty.  A deputy sheriff then shoots and kills Murdoch.

In the aftermath of this incident, F+B does merge with Unity, forming the Fishbine + Unity (F+U) Ambulance Company, based out of the old F+B garage.  (The new acronym for the company is also a slang abbreviation of "fuck you"; the old F+B stood for "Fish + Bine".)  Speed, who has been cleared of all charges, is reinstated to the police force, though he remains romantically involved with Jugs.  Jugs is initially relegated to switchboard duty again, until Mother insists that she become his new partner.

==TV version== ABC aired pilot as a one-time special in August 1978.

==Production==
Joseph Barbera, one half of the legendary cartoon-creating duo Hanna-Barbera, served as executive producer for this movie. Tom Mankiewicz says it was Barberas idea to make a film about ambulance driving. He had a deal with 20th Century Fox who paid a writer to develop a script. Mankiewicz, then best known for writing several James Bond movies, became interested and was hired. He did research on the subject and wrote his own script, and then attached Peter Yates as director. Alan Ladd Jnr, then head of production for Fox, said he would make the film if it could be done for less than $3 million. 

Yates and Mankiewicz thought the lead role of Mother Tucker was perfect for Gene Hackman and offered him the role but Hackman was exhausted from working on Lucky Lady and declined. However he recommended Bill Cosby as an alternative; Yates, Mankiewicz and Ladd all agreed and Cosby accepted the part. The tight budget meant the leads had to accept deferred payment. The female lead was offered to Valerie Perrine but she would not take deferred payment so Raquel Welch was cast instead. Tom Mankiewicz and Robert Crane, My Life as a Mankiewicz, University Press of Kentucky 2012 p170-174 

==Reception==
According to Tom Mankiewicz the film was made for around $3 million and grossed $17 million. 

The movie was referenced in the 2006 film Relative Strangers multiple times throughout the film, most notably during the game of Charades scene.
