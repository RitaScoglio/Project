==Production==
The movie was shot entirely on location in Kenya. According to the article "To Realize the Impossible Dream" in the Marvel Comics Super Special for the film (see below), producer Paul Aratow had been trying to get the movie made since ten years prior its completion and release in 1984.

"At first it looked incredibly easy," Aratow says in the interview. "After only two months I had an office at the studio and Raquel Welch was going to play Sheena." However, the film became mired in preproduction limbo and bounced back and forth between different studios for the next several years.
 David Newman King Kong.

The film was shot over seven months and ran into all of the expected production problems involved with shooting on location. Ted Wass (Vic Casey) recalled, in the article "Man on the Spot" (an article about executive producer Yoram Ben-Ami, also found in the Super Special), "Making a movie is like going to war. You can be the greatest general in the world but if you dont have a good army, youre going to lose the battle."

The films multitude of animals were managed by Hubert Wells, who recalled, "We flew over an elephant, a rhino, five lions, four leopards, four chimpanzees, five horses and sixteen birds. It was the largest shipment of animals back to Africa and just getting all the necessary permits to bring them in and out of the country was a superhuman task."

Wells had few problems with the trained animals, but the crew did have some with wild animals that would come onto the set, in particular wild lions who would try to start fights with the tamed ones. Guards had to be posted on the set at night to keep them away. Despite this, Wells was quoted as saying that he enjoyed working on the picture so much he hoped for a sequel, which of course never came.

== Reception ==
On the television program  s comic-book jungle-queen, but Mother Nature forgot to endow her with a script. Supposed to be campy, but its just plain awful."

The New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael was among the very few critics who liked the film. Calling it a "lighthearted, slightly loony adventure film, there are some good silly gags, and the animals look relaxed even in their dizziest slapstick scenes. And the picture certainly never starves the eye; the cinematography is by the celebrated Pasqualino De Santis." Kael even had some (qualified) kind words for the star: "Tanya Roberts is too tense and earnest for her blond-goddess, queen-of-the-jungle role, but she has the face of a ballerina, and a prodigious slim, muscular form, and she gazes into space with exquisitely blank pale-blue eyes. Shes pretty funny when she presses her fingers on the center of her forehead and summons legions of waterbucks or swarms of tall birds." 

==Soundtrack listing== composed and conducted by Richard Hartley for the film was released in 1984. It was reissued on CD by Varèse Sarabande in 2004, separating the first track into two parts ("Theme" and "Interlude").

==Comic adaptation== Marvel Super Special #34, written by Cary Burkett and illustrated by Gray Morrow.  It followed the story of the film very closely, and developed the character of Fletch the cameraman quite a bit more than in the film, in particular revealing his surname to be "Agronsky". The comic also had several pages in the back about the making of the film. One noteworthy difference between the film and the comic concerns the ethnicity of Otwanis troops. In the film, they are all Caucasian race|white. In the comic, the only white soldiers are Colonel Jorgenson and the helicopter pilot (identified as "Joe"), while all of the others are of African descent, including the featured soldiers.

New editions of the comic books were first published by Devils Due, then the comic book publication was licensed to Moonstone by Galaxy Publishing, Inc.  This latest version of the comic book is now (2012) being published.
