}} French film written and directed by Francois Ozon and starring Sasha Hails as a young British mother living in a small seaside village in France who takes in a malevolent homeless drifter (played by Marina de Van) while her husband is away on business.

==Plot==
The Englishwoman Sasha lives on ÃŽle dYeu near France with her ten-month-old daughter and her husband, who is often away for business. One day, when Sasha is home alone, the drifter Tatiana appears at Sashas door and asks her for permission to pitch her tent in the garden.  At first reserved and reluctant, Sasha eventually allows her this and both women begin to develop a relationship with each other.  Sasha decides to go shopping and leaves Sioffra in Tatianas care.  When, upon her return, she finds everything in order, she finally invites Tatiana inside her house, even though she is irritated by Tatianas unusual behavior. 

When Sashas husband comes home on the following day, he finds an empty house.  In the tent behind the house lies Sasha bound and dead. Tatiana holds the crying Sioffra on a ferry, which is leaving the island.
