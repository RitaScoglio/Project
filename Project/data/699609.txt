==Plot== Malibu to Anaheim, California|Anaheim. An American presidential candidate (portrayed by Cliff Robertson), who is also an outspoken theocracy|theocrat, has been saying that L.A. is a "city of sin," and that "like the mighty fist of God, waters will rise up and separate this sinful, sinful city from our country." The candidate is shortly elected president and, by a forced amendment to the Constitution of the United States, his term is made permanent. 
 death by electrocution as an alternative. A containment wall is built around the island with armed guards and watchtowers posted. Those sent to the island are exiled permanently. He also banishes all the other political parties to ensure that he would be president for life. He also demolishes the Manhattan prison and rebuilds it, and relocates all the prisoners to L.A.
 Sword of Dark Ages. The president intends to use the system to destroy the "ability to function" of Americas enemies and eventually dominate the world using the weapon as blackmail.

While traveling aboard Air Force Three to meet with her father, Utopia leaves the plane in an escape pod and lands on L.A. Island to join Cuervo. With the satellites under his control, Cuervo promises to take back America with the assistance of an allied invasion force of third world nations that are standing by to attack. He claims that if the president tries to stop him, he will "pull the plug" on the country and black out the capital. In addition, Cuervo also knows a secret code that can knock out power for the entire planet, i.e. the "world code."
 16 years after the Manhattan incident, Snake Plissken is captured for a series of crimes and is scheduled to be exiled to the island. Upon his arrival for deportation, he meets the president and is offered the mission of retrieving the weapon in exchange for a full pardon for all the crimes Snake has ever committed if he is successful. The president indicates he does not care whether Utopia is returned or not, declaring her a traitor. To ensure Snakes compliance, he is infected with the man-made Plutoxin 7 virus that will kill him within ten hours. If he completes the mission, Snake will be given an antidote and cured of the virus. 
 transsexual gang leader Hershe Las Palmas (Pam Grier), who lives on a huge tanker and has been in L.A for the past 5 years. Together with Hershe and her gang, Snake stages a final assault on Cuervos forces.
 The Happy Kingdom by the Sea and takes the remote control. He leaves the island with Utopia and some other Cuervo resistors in a helicopter. Eddie mortally wounds Cuervo, but the revolutionary fires a rocket launcher at the helicopter. Seeing the incoming rocket, Eddie leaps off the aircraft, landing on an awning. The rocket hits the helicopter and kills those in the back of the chopper; Snake and Utopia bail out before it crashes. When the presidents men reach the crash site, Snake intentionally hands off the wrong remote to the president while Utopia is taken to the electric chair, despite her pleas for forgiveness. The Plutoxin 7 virus is revealed to be nothing more than a fast, hard-hitting case of the flu. The president tries using the satellites to stop a Cuban invasion force threatening Florida. Activating the remote, the president hears only Eddies "Map to the Stars" intro over "I Love L.A.." 

The president, furious about being given a wrong remote, orders Snakes execution, but Snake tricks him and his troops by using a holographic illusion of himself. Seeing the problem of one man having such power over the world, Snake activates the real Damocles and enters the secret world code, against pleas to stop. Within seconds, all electronic technology worldwide is shut down by the satellites; as a result, the entire world descends to the Dark Ages and all the technology shuts down.

==Production==
The film was in development for over ten years with a script commissioned in 1985, written by screenwriter Coleman Luck. Carpenter would later describe the script as "too light, too campy".  The project remained dormant following that time until the 1994 earthquake and the L.A. riots revived it. Carpenter and Kurt Russell got together to write with their long-time collaborator Debra Hill. Carpenter insists that it was Russells persistence that allowed the film to be made, since "Snake Plissken was a character he loved and wanted to play again".  Principal filming began in December 1995. Carpenter has stated that if he ever did another sequel for the Escape films he would call it Escape from Earth.  Russell has also stated that out of all the characters he has done in his career, Snake Plissken is his favorite. 

==Reception==
Escape from L.A. was a box office bomb, only earning $25,477,365 from its $50 million budget—about as much as its predecessor, but little more than half its significantly higher budget.

In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program in order to predict and anticipate a specific criminals every move. The robots first test subject is Americas public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality.
