 independent drama novel of Showtime and Lifetime in 2005 after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004. 

==Plot==
Melinda Sordino (Kristen Stewart) starts out her freshman year in high school struggling on the first day and being labeled as a "whistleblower|squealer". A series of flashbacks reveals that she called the police to a house party during the previous summer. Her real reason for calling 9-1-1 was that she was raped at the party by a senior student, Andy Evans (Eric Lively). While on the phone, she was unable to talk to the police about what happened, and when the police arrived, she did not report the rape. The party was crashed, causing mayhem and everyone to flee from the police.

When her parents see her report card, they prompt her to see Mr. Neck (Robert John Burke), who tells her to write an essay on any history topic. After refusing to read her paper aloud to her class, she gets sent to the office of the school principal. Melinda is nice to a new student named Heather Billings (Allison Siko), who claims to be Melindas "friend", but Heather abandons Melinda when the chance for social advancement arises. The only other student with whom Melinda has a positive experience is her lab partner Dave Petrakis (Michael Angarano), who has successfully managed to keep from affiliating himself with a clique.

As the year progresses, Melinda begins a painfully slow recapture of her confidence, with some help from Dave and her art teacher Mr. Freeman (Steve Zahn). Her former friend Rachel Bruin (Hallee Hirsh) starts dating Andy, and as the only other person who knows about the event, Melinda fears that Rachel will suffer the same fate. Melinda finds Rachel at the library and tells her the truth about what happened at the party by writing it on paper. At first Rachel refuses to believe her, thinking Melinda is lying and calls her "sick", but comes to realize the truth by confronting Andy. After Rachel begins to tell other people what happened, Andy threatens and begins to attack Melinda. 

He corners her and forces her to tell everybody at school that the incident is false, and she struggles to get free. They are found by one of her old friends and a group of girls. Mr. Neck sees Melinda walking away from the scene and asks what was going on, but Melinda doesnt respond. On the way back from the hospital after being treated for her injuries, Melinda rolls down the window of the car, breathing in deeply. She finally finds the strength to tell her mother the truth about what happened at the party. Although it is clear that Melinda will still need time to fully recover from her ordeals, this is a significant and empowering event in her life, as she finally finds the courage to speak.

Producer and screenwriter Annie Young Frisbie read the novel and successfully made a bid to get the rights to a film version. Production took place in Columbus, Ohio because a production partner, Matthew Myers, was relocating there with his wife.

Film production took only 21 days in August 2003. Flooding during an especially heavy summer rain caused filming to be temporarily postponed and during that time author Laurie Halse Anderson visited the set with her daughter. Anderson herself cameos in the film as the lunch lady who gives Melinda the mashed potatoes.
 Eastmoor Academy on the east side of Columbus.
