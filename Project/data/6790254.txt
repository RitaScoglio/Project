==Synopsis==
Maxi (Nathan Lopez) is a 12-year-old effeminate gay boy who lives in the slums with his father and brothers who are petty thieves. The story primarily revolves around the conflict between his love for handsome young police officer Victor (JR Valentin), and his familys illegal livelihood. Neo-realist in orientation, the film is a tale of lost innocence and redemption amidst the poverty of Manilas slums.
 molest him, but is saved by the appearance of Victor.  Victor does not have a girlfriend, and his sexuality is never revealed. He rebuffs Maxis advances, and when Maxis father and brother bogs friends teaching Victor a lesson. Maxi came and rescue the pitiful Victor and he cleaned Victors wounds and cooks breakfast for Victor and felt sorry to his friend. Victor became affectionately stoking Maxis head even when the boy steals a kiss.


After Maxis father is killed by Victors boss, Maxi resists Victors attempts to renew their friendship.  The closing scene shows Maxi walking past Victor who has parked by the roadside on Maxis way to school.  He ignores Victor as he passes him, hesitates momentarily as he crosses the road, then goes on his way. This last scene is a homage to the final scene of "The Third Man".
