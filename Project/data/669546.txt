A pastiche of characters board a German ocean liner in Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico, for a voyage to Bremerhaven, Germany, along with 600 displaced workers in steerage, being deported from Cuba back to Spain, and a not-so-exotic band of entertainers, for whom the voyage is just a job. Some are happy to be bound for a rising Nazi Germany, some are apprehensive, while others appear oblivious to its potential dangers.

Others aboard include a young American couple, David (George Segal) and Jenny (Elizabeth Ashley), who bicker because David is unhappy at his lack of success with painting. A divorcée, Mary Treadwell (Vivien Leigh), drinks and flirts, on a quest to recapture her youth in Paris. Bill Tenny (Lee Marvin) is a former baseball player disappointed in the way his career never quite took off. They are distracted by the music and the professional dancers, whose flirtations seem to skirt the edges of solicitation, or dive right in to the seedy side of oblivion.

When the passengers disembark, two are no longer with them - the countess, who has been taken to an island prison, and the doctor, who has died.

Producer and director Stanley Kramer who ended up with the film, planned to star Vivien Leigh but was initially unaware of the fragile mental and physical health of his star.

Steinberg, Jay.   Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: October 10, 2013.  Leighs performance was tinged by paranoia and resulted in outbursts that marred her relationship with other actors, although both Simone Signoret and Lee Marvin were sympathetic and understanding.
