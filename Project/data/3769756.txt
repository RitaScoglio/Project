Wind is a film released in 1992. The movie was directed by Carroll Ballard and starred Matthew Modine, Jennifer Grey and Cliff Robertson.

== Plot summary == Peter Montgomery.
"Wind" contains some of the best, most realistic, on deck big-boat sailing sequences ever portrayed in a commercial film (with subtle explanations of the actions).

==Cup events depicted in the film==
A host of events that occurred in the 1987 Americas Cup held off Fremantle Australia were translated into film and presented as events occurring to the characters in the movie, including the following: Chris Dicksons Louis Vuitton Kiwi Magic was just six seconds back of Dennis Conners boat when Dickson made his only major mistake of the summer, striking the buoy while rounding the final mark.  He was obliged to re-round, ending all hope of catching Stars & Stripes 87.
* Jack Neville spearing the "Whomper" was taken from the Defender Semifinals, when Australia IV introduced a new sail they called the genniker, an enormous asymmetrical hybrid that pulled Australia IV even with the leading Kookaburra II.  As the Bond team came up, Peter Gilmour luffed hard, spearing Australia IVs genniker and splitting it in two.
* The broken mast of the Platypus occurred to Challenge France in the middle of the third and final challenger rounds robins.  Challenge France was unable to continue in the regatta.
* The boat collision occurred in the Defender series, when Australia IV struck Peter Gilmours Kookaburra II.
* The protests and media briefings occurred multiple times throughout the regatta, and at times were quite contentious.
*Stellan Skarsgårds character is based on Burt Rutan who designed an airfoil for Dennis Conner’s 1988 catamaran “Stars & Stripes”.

In addition, Peter Gilmour, the skipper of Kookaburra II whose aggressive sailing during the defender selection series earned himself a place on the defender boat for the Americas Cup, participated in the making of the movie, acting as "Sailing Master".  He was on board for all of the sailing sequences, controlled the boat while they were flying the "Whomper", and can be seen in many of the boat scenes, surreptitiously laying a hand on the opposite wheel.   Lisa Blackaller, daughter of Americas Cup skipper Tom Blackaller, acted as sailing double for Jennifer Grey for the small boat races in the International 14 class at Newport.
