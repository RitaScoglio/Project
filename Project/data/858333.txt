 American reality film released on April 25, 2003 in the U.S.

Inspired by the reality television genre, this film followed the lives of sixteen Americans from March 13–23, 2003 as they celebrated spring break in Cancún, Mexico and experienced romantic relationships, emotional strife, or just had a good time.   
 nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie at the 2003 Golden Raspberry Awards. Film director Michael Tully argued that the timing of the films release during the 2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq makes the films depiction of young American hedonism "one of the more unintentionally brilliant statements of hypocrisy of the decade" and the film itself "a disturbingly relevant historical document".

The movie took in $3,825,000 domestically and $1,520,000 internationally, coming well short of its $7,500,000 production cost.  The initial DVD release that followed was, in turn, followed in 2005 by an extended edition DVD that included extra footage.

Some early media reports suggested that this film was a theatrical spin-off of The Real World reality series, also produced by Bunim-Murray Productions, but in fact there was no direct link between the two productions.

Most of the films cast returned to general obscurity after the movie was released, with the exception of Laura Ramsey who launched an acting career.
