Flight of the Navigator is a 1986 comic science fiction film directed by Randal Kleiser and written by Mark H. Baker and Michael Burton, about David Freeman, a 12-year-old boy who is abducted by an alien spaceship and finds himself caught in a world that has changed around him.

The films producers initially sent the project to Walt Disney Pictures in 1984, but as the studio was unable to approve it, it was sent to Producers Sales Organization, which made a deal with Disney to distribute it in the United States.  It was partially shot in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Norway, it being a coproduction with Norwegian company Viking Film. 

==Plot==
 
The film follows David Scott Freeman, (Joey Cramer) a 12-year-old boy living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1978. David is an ordinary boy who lives with an ordinary family, constantly bickering with his little brother, Jeff (Albie Whitaker), and finding an interest in girls.

On the night of July 4th, 1978, David takes a walk through the woods to escort his younger brother home. On the way there his dog, Bruiser, alerts him of something down in a ravine. When David goes to investigate, he falls into the ravine and is knocked unconscious. When he wakes up, the story takes an eerie turn. David goes back to his house and finds that his family no longer lives there. After the current owners call the police, they find a missing persons report about David made by his parents. The police run through a computer with the date he went missing and find out he was declared legally dead. The police reunite him with his family, but they have aged, and when they go to greet him, he faints.

Elsewhere, an alien spaceship crashes into an electrical tower and is rendered inert. NASA agents, led by Dr. Louis Faraday (Howard Hesseman), confiscate it, explaining to police that it is their experimental spacelab. They bring it to their own hangar, but is impregnable from the outside.

Next, David is taken to the hospital for memory testing and observation, and learns that it is now the year 1986; his parents are middle-aged, and his younger brother, Jeff, is now 16. When testing is done to try and find memory of what happened at the ravine, his mind exhibits images of the ship and communicates with the computer in a different language, so the lead doctor alerts NASA. Faraday convinces him and his family that the truth about his absence will be discovered within 48 hours, takes him to his research facility, and locks him away as a "national security risk". During this time, he is taken to a room to rest, and while he watches Blancmanges "Lose Your Love" music video, he befriends Carolyn McAdams (Sarah Jessica Parker), a charming intern who is in charge of him and gives him some company along with a robotic assistant named R.A.L.F.

Faraday runs his own memory tests on David and finds his mind full with alien technical manuals and star charts covering expanses of the galaxy far exceeding anything humans have recorded. His subconscious mind tells the scientists that he was taken to a planet called Phaelon, 560 light-years away, in just over a 4.4 solar-hour (2.2 Earth-hour) journey. They realize that David has experienced time dilation as a result of having travelled at the lSpeed of light, explaining why eight years have passed on Earth, but not for him. David is unable to comprehend what Faraday is telling him and flees the room, leaving Faraday muttering that 48 hours will be insufficient to finish his investigation. Carolyn informs him about the schedule for him to stay all week, and he tells her to alert his family.

The next morning, the ship telepathically contacts David, and tells him to hide in the R.A.L.F robot sent to his room, which takes him to the hangar where it is being held. He boards the ship, and its robotic commander, (voiced by Paul Reubens, credited as Paul Mall), referring to David as "Navigator," evades NASA pursuit. He takes the ship about 20 miles away from the NASA hangar, where the ship transforms into a less conspicuous object to hide.

The ships artificial intelligence, who refers to himself as a "Trimaxion Drone Ship" ("Max" for short), tells him that his mission was to travel the galaxy, collect biological specimens, take them to Phaelon for analysis, and then return them to their homes. Phaelons scientists discovered humans only use 10% of their brain and, as an experiment, filled the remainder of his with miscellaneous information, including all of the star charts discovered by Phaelons astronomers, including the information that leaked from his brain. Max then returned him to Earth, but didnt take him back to his own time, knowing that a human could be vaporized in the process. Before leaving Earth, Max accidentally crashed the ship, erasing all the computers star charts and data. He therefore needs the information in Davids brain to return home. When Faradays agents try to retrieve the ship and David, Max transforms the ship again and hides in the ocean. Realizing David doesnt know instructions to guide the ship with a star chart, Max programs the ship for a mind transfer, and David is shown the eight remaining alien specimens on board, and bonds with a "Puckmaren", a tiny bat-like alien. Puckmaren is the last of his kind after a comet destroyed his planet.

Max performs a mind transfer on David to reacquire the star charts, but in the process also contracts human emotional attributes, which results in him speaking just like Pee-Wee Herman, he even laughs like him. He and David start bickering, like David and Jeff always did, and when David calls him a geek, he shuts down, and allows the ship to fall from the sky, taunting David as he struggles to gain control. Eventually controlling the ship, David wanders Earth looking for Fort Lauderdale, triggering several UFO reports in many cities, including Tokyo. In the meantime, Carolyn has made contact with his family and told them about his escape in the ship; as a result, Faraday has them put under house arrest and has Carolyn transported to the facility.

David arrives in the Florida Keys, and asks the owner of a gas station for money, and telephones Jeff to ask for a signal from their new house so that he can find it, while the owner stares at the ship and the children of a family observe it. When the ship leaves, the whole family looks up at the ship. The owner remarks, "He just said he wanted to phone home," an homage to E.T. David reaches Fort Lauderdale and Jeff sets off fireworks to signal his brother. David hones in on them, but NASA agents, having tracked the ships every move, are there first. David, fearing that he would remain in the facility for his life if he remained in 1986, orders Max to return him to 1978, regardless of the risk to his life. Through space-time travel, he soon reaches the ravine.

David wakes up, walks home, and finds everything as he left it.  David watches Max flash the sky against the backdrop of fireworks, with the specimens and Max laughing. Max says "See you later, Navigator!" telepathically to David and the film closes.
