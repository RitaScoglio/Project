 adventure fantasy fantasy film Thomas the Isle of Man Film Commission and distributed by Destination Films (a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment).  It was written, produced and directed by Britt Allcroft.

When it was first released in the U.K. where critics were unfamiliar with the characters from Shining Time Station, the film was accused of "Americanization|Americanizing" Thomas.  Critical reception in the U.S. was somewhat better, but still mostly negative, in stark contrast to the praise given to the original Shining Time Station, which was an award-winning show.    Since the films release, various specials based on Thomas & Friends have been released, although they are not directly related to this film. This is Mara Wilsons final film appearance to date.

==Plot== Edward Glen) and Gordon (voiced by Neil Crone) encounter an evil and cross diesel locomotive named Diesel 10 (originally voiced by Keith Scott/also voiced by Neil Crone), who has a claw on top of him who he names "Pinchy." He states he has incomplete work on Sodor. Meanwhile in Shining Time, Mr. Conductor has his own problems as his supply of gold dust, which allows him to magically teleport from place to place, is running low and isnt enough to allow him to travel back from Sodor.

Later that day, while Thomas and James (Originally voiced by Michael Angelis/voiced by Susan Roman) are at Tidmouth Sheds, Diesel 10 arrives and announces his evil plan to get rid of the steam engines on Sodor once and for all since he had hated them for some reason. Thomas leaves to collect Mr. Conductor, who is now running late and is worried that the journey from Shining Time to Sodor has been getting bumpier and bumpier since "the lost engine" vanished. Unknown to Mr. Conductor, the lost engine, named Lady (voiced by Writer, Director and Show creator, Britt Allcroft), is hidden in a workshop on Muffle Mountain above Shining Time. Ladys aging guardian, Burnett Stone (Peter Fonda), has kept her hidden after Diesel 10s last attempt to destroy her. Despite having rebuilt Lady, Burnett was unable to steam her despite using different types of coal. At night, Diesel 10 attacks the shed where the steam engines are sleeping, but Mr. Conductor repels him with sugar after his gold dust fails him and Diesel 10 quickly retreats. 

While talking at Knapford Station, Percy (Also originally voiced by Michael Angelis/voiced by Linda Ballantyne) and Thomas conclude that there is a secret railway between Sodor and Shining Time. Diesel 10 overhears them and goes to the Sodor Ironworks to tell his dim-witted hench-diesels, Splatter (originally voiced by Patrick Breen/also voiced by Neil Crone) and Dodge (also originally voiced by Patrick Breen/voiced by Kevin Frank), of his plans to destroy the lost engine and the other steam engines on Sodor which Mr. Conductor, whose gold dust is running out, wont be able to stop. Toby (voiced by Colm Feore) follows Diesel 10 and overhears his plans of destroying the steam engines. He rings his bell to distract him, causing Diesel 10 to knock the roof of the shed where he, Splatter, and Dodge are in. Later, after the song "Really Useful Engine", Henry (also voiced by Kevin Frank) has a bad cold and Thomas was collecting six special Island of Sodor coal trucks for Henry, but he has five according to Bertie (also voiced by Kevin Frank) because one rolled away towards the Magic Railroad through the Magic Buffers.

Lily Stone (Mara Wilson), Burnetts granddaughter, was being sent from a big city to visit Burnett on Muffle Mountain. While at the railway station, she meets a dog named Mutt who puts her on the Rainbow Sun, a steam train which goes to Shining Time, instead of the right train. On arriving at Shining Time, she meets Mr. Conductors lazy cousin Junior (Michael E. Rodgers) and station manager Stacy Jones (Didi Conn) who takes her to Burnetts house. The next day, Lily meets Patch (Cody McMains), who has been helping Burnett look after Lady and takes her on a horse ride to Shining Time where she meets Junior again. Junior takes her through the Magic Railroad to Sodor where they meet Thomas.

Thomas, who has been looking for Mr. Conductor, isnt happy to see Junior but agrees to help Lily and Junior and takes them to the windmill where they find Mr. Conductor, who had been captured by Diesel 10, is looking for more gold dust only to be flung to the windmill after cutting one of his claws hydraulic hoses. Junior climbs onto one of the windmill sails and ends up being thrown onto Diesel 10s roof; later that night, Percy finds Splatter and Dodge, who have located the Sodor entrance to the Magic Railroad in a grotto at the end of an old siding and goes to warn Thomas.

Thomas agrees to take Lily home to Shining Time and sets off. While travelling through the Magic Railroad, Thomas discovers the missing truck of special Sodor coal, which he collects and arrives at the other end of the Magic Railroad, high on a cliff near the summit of Muffle Mountain. Lily goes to find Burnett, leaving Thomas stranded on the mountain; the wind suddenly picks up and Thomas coupling comes loose from the truck, causing him to roll down the mountain and into a field where he re-enters the Magic Railroad through another secret portal.

Lily finds Burnett in his workshop, where he shows her Lady and explains his problem in getting her to steam. Lily suggests using Sodor coal; Patch goes back to retrieve the truck and Burnett uses the coal to fire Lady up. Now able to steam, Burnett, Lily, Patch and Mutt take Lady back along the Magic Railroad, regenerating both Lady and the railroad in the process. Lady comments that Burnett had never forgotten about Magic; Thomas then arrives and the two engines return to Sodor where they meet Mr. Conductor and Junior, who had used the last of his gold dust to rescue both himself and James from Diesel 10 at the Ironworks just as he was about to kill them both by pushing them into the big furnace from behind.

Diesel 10 arrives with Splatter and Dodge, who finally decide to stop helping him. Thomas and Lady, driven by Burnett, flee from Diesel 10, chasing them towards a crumbling viaduct. Thomas and Lady make it safely across, and Diesel 10 applies his brakes, but it is too late and he falls off the bridge and lands into a barge of sludge where he is carried away and taken to somewhere else unknown, and knowing that he is going to be in big trouble with Sir Topham Hatt. Later that evening, Thomas, Lady and Burnett return at the grotto. Lily combines water from a wishing well and shavings from the Magic Railroad to make more gold dust, saving Sodor and Shining Time. Junior decides to go to work on Sodor and Mr. Conductor gives him his own cap before sending him to another railway, before leaving himself to welcome Sir Topham Hatt home. Lily, Burnett, Patch and Mutt return to Shining Time, while Thomas happily steams back to Tidmouth to tell the other engines about his encounter with Lady.

==Production==
===Development=== fourth season Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, Britt Allcroft planned a Thomas the Tank Engine feature film. Then in 1995, Allcroft was approached by Barry London, then Vice-Chairman of Paramount Pictures, with an idea for a Thomas film. His interest is thought to have stemmed from his daughter, then 3, being enthralled by Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.

In February 1996, Allcroft signed a contract with Paramount Pictures to write a script with the title, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, with a release date of 1997.  However when Barry London left Paramount Pictures, plans for the film were shelved by Paramount, leading Allcroft to seek other sources of funding.

Then in the Summer of 1998, Allcroft saw an Isle of Man Film Commission advert. They were offering tax incentives to companies wanting to film on the Island. Allcroft visited and felt the location perfect.

Then in 1999, Barry London became Chairman of the newly founded Destination Films. He renewed his interest in the project and Destination Films became the main financial backer and studio for the film.   

===Filming===
The movie was filmed at the Strasburg Rail Road in Strasburg, Pennsylvania (United States), as well as in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and on the Isle of Man. Castletown railway station on the Isle of Man Railway formed part of Shining Time Station and the goods shed at Port St Mary railway station became Burnett Stones workshop. Running shots of the "Indian Valley" train were filmed at the Strasburg Rail Road location. The large passenger station where Lily boards the train is the Harrisburg Transportation Center.  Norfolk & Western 4-8-0 475|4-8-0 475 was repainted as the Indian Valley locomotive.

===Original version===
In a 2007 interview, director Britt Allcroft commented the finished film was drastically changed from what it was originally going to be the way she had written it, with the original antagonist P.T. Boomer, (originally played by Doug Lennox) being deleted from the film after the US test audiences said that he was too frightening for the younger audience (but still seen in a number of trailers). Lily Stone (played by Mara Wilson) was supposed to be the narrator of the story.  Before filming, Thomass voice would be provided by John Bellis, a fireman and part-time taxi driver who worked on the film as the Isle of Man transportation co-ordinator and facilities manager. Bellis received the role when he happened to pick up Britt Allcroft and her crew from the airport. According to Allcroft, after hearing him speak for the first time, she told her colleagues, "I have just heard the voice of Thomas. That man is exactly how Thomas would sound!" Bellis accepted the role.  Unfortunately he lost the role after a test screening. Audiences in Los Angeles disliked Belliss voice for Thomas due to his Liverpudlian accent claiming that he made Thomas sound too old. Subsequently, Belliss role was removed and was replaced by Edward Glen, who gave Thomas a lot more of a youthful-sounding voice. Bellis did receive a credit for his work on the Isle of Man, and his voice can still be heard extensively in one or two of the trailers. Bellis said he was "gutted", but wished the film-makers well. "It was supposed to be my big break, but it hasnt put me off and I am hoping something else will come along.    " {{cite news

Thomas and the Magic Railroad received generally unfavorable reviews from critics.  The film has a score of 19% on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus: "Kids these days demand cutting edge special effects or at least a clever plot with cute characters. This movie has neither, having lost in its Americanization what the British original did so right."  However, it did receive a positive review from Associated Press and Gannett newspapers. Nell Minow of Common Sense Media also gave the film a positive review, giving it three out of five stars and writing that it "will please  " but that the plot "might confuse kids".  Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one star out of four, and wrote "(the fact) That Thomas and the Magic Railroad made it into theaters at all is something of a mystery. This is a production with straight to video written all over it. Kids who like the Thomas books might kinda like it. Especially younger kids. Real younger kids. Otherwise, no." While he admired the models and art direction, he criticized how the engines mouths didnt move when they spoke, the overly depressed performance of Peter Fonda, as well as the overall lack of consistency in the plot.
