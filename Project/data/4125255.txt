== Reception ==
Filmfare ranked Sridevis performance in Chaalbaaz 4th in its list of 80 Iconic Performances of Hindi Cinema stating that "Sridevi´s penchant for giggles and her ability to look distinctly tearful when required polishes these performances to perfection. Hell, she made Sunny Deol and Rajnikant look like sidekicks in the film".  while the Times of India article Bollywoods Hit Double Roles gushed "Sridevis performance rocked the box office".  Rediff featured the film in its countdown of 25 Best Double Roles in Bollywood saying "What you dont realise until you have seen ChaalBaaz is just how incredible Sridevi is at depicting both ends of the spectrum"  and that the film "cemented her position as an actress with a killer comic timing".    Speaking to Indian Express about Sridevis act in ChaalBaaz, the director Pankaj Parashar said "She proved her range with the movie and after that she got lots of offers which saw her in a double role".  Her slapstick rain dance Na jaane kahan se aayi hai became a big hit with Times of India describing it as a "Sridevi classic where she simply looked wow with her chirpy expressions and rain drops kissing her cheeks".  Saroj Khan ultimately won the Filmfare Award for Best Choreography.
