His family decides to have him ruled incompetent and Dr. Harada (Takashi Shimura), a Domestic Court counselor, attempts to arbitrate. Harada, a civil volunteer in the case, sympathizes with Nakajimas conviction, but the old mans irrational behavior prevents the court from taking his fears seriously.

==Production==
One of the final film of this period in which Akira Kurosawa would   directly address the fear of nuclear holocaust and the implications of the atom bomb. The director shows the Japanese society coming out from under that threat and World War II, but still terrorized by memories of the past and anxieties for the future. Even though it had been ten years since the U.S. military had dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945, Japanese filmmakers had avoided the subject in studio features for years. Recent events, however, such as the nuclear testing in Bikini Atoll which exposed Japanese fishermen to fallout and the radioactive rain that fell on northern provinces, compelled Kurosawa to make this powerful film.

This was the last film that composer Fumio Hayasaka worked on before dying of tuberculosis in 1955. He had been Kurosawas close friend since 1948 and had collaborated with him on several films.
