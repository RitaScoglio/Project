}} adventure crime thriller film directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Meryl Streep, Kevin Bacon, David Strathairn, John C. Reilly, Benjamin Bratt  and Joseph Mazzello as Roarke. The film involves a family on a whitewater rafting trip who encounter two violent criminals in the wilderness.

==Plot== Salmon River in Idaho, along with their dog, Maggie. Their daughter, Willa (Stephanie Sawyer), accompanies them to Gails parents house in Idaho. At the last minute, just when they are about to leave for the almost week-long trip, Tom joins them. As they are setting off, they meet a couple of other rafters, Wade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry (John C. Reilly), who appear to be friendly. Thus they leave for the trip, leaving Willa behind to be taken care of by her grandparents.
 renderings rather than entering fully into the experience. This agitates Roarke, who thinks his father does not really seem to realize he is away from home. They are joined by Wade and Terry, who help to celebrate Roarkes birthday the same night. Gail becomes friendly with Wade. However, after a while he begins acting suspiciously, and she decides it would be best to part ways. During the mornings rafting, he reveals to Roarke that they have a gun with them. As they raft down the river, Gail and Tom discuss an exit strategy that will allow them to leave the two men behind, and at lunch they attempt to leave on their raft and get away before Wade and Terry realize what is going on.

Their attempt fails, and Wade pulls the gun on them and assaults Tom. Maggie runs off during the melee, avoiding a shot by Wade. Gail then realizes that an armed robbery she had heard about was actually carried out by Wade and Terry, and their rafting trip is actually a way for them to get away. The family is forced to raft at gunpoint down the rest of the river before they all set up camp for the night.

A park ranger named Johnny (Benjamin Bratt), who knows Gail, is whitewater canoeing down the river. He bumps into them. Wade holds the gun to Gails back, and they pretend everything is okay. Later, Johnny reappears. Wade shoots him and throws him into the rapids.

Wade and Terry want to go down the river to a set of rapids where rafting is no longer allowed, because in recent years one person was killed and another was left paralyzed. They force Gail to raft down through those rapids despite her repeated attempts to flip the raft and so force them out of the river.

During the night, Tom attempts to steal the gun from the sleeping Terry but is heard and has to run into the bushes and to the river. Wade gives chase and believes he has shot him, when he hears a loud splash into the water.

Tom reappears, reunites with Maggie, and manages to flip the raft. Gail and Roarke, whom Wade has tied to it, remain in it and manage to get hold of the gun, which had fallen into the water, while Tom is fighting Terry. The struggle ends when Gail throws the bag of money into the water and shoots Wade, whose corpse floats off down the river. The film ends with the family and Terry (who has been arrested) being helicoptered out.

==Production==
  valley used in the film]] Rogue River Southern Oregon, and the Middle Fork of the Flathead River.  Meryl Streep did several of her own stunts in the film on the milder river sections.  She had a scare at the end of one day of filming when Hanson asked her to shoot one more scene, which she protested against because of her exhaustion. However, she decided to attempt it, and weak from fatigue, was swept off the raft into the river and was in danger of drowning before she was rescued. Because she was so tired, she would have drowned if it hadnt been for her personal flotation device and the river rescue team. Afterwards she said to Hanson, "In the future, when I say I cant do something, I think you should believe me," to which he agreed.  The major whitewater stunts were performed by expert professional river guide Kelley Kalafatich who was hired as Ms. Streeps stunt double for the movie.

==Reception==

===Critics=== The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992), stating that Hanson, "could manipulate characters and situations within the comfortable confines of a formula plot", and describing The River Wild as a "level of excitement designed to submerge implausibilities and minor gaffes, and a film which "braves the rapids while keeping the viewer afloat amidst its churning waters".    He also praised Streeps powerful performance as a female action hero but described the film overall as "a cut below a white-knuckler".

===Nominations, awards, and recognitions=== Blue Sky Ed Wood respectively. 

Streeps character, Gail, was a Nominated Hero in AFIs 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains.
