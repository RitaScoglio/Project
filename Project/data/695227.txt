The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing (Robert G. Henderson). The film received mostly positive reviews and earned more than United States dollar|$227 million worldwide.

==Plot== LAPD Sergeants Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh are pursuing unidentified suspects transporting an illegal shipment of gold krugerrands. Afrikaner apartheid government subsequently charges local consul-general Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland) and security agent Pieter Vorstedt (Derrick OConnor) to warn both detectives off the investigation; they are reassigned to protecting an obnoxious federal witness, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), after an attack on Murtaughs home.
 laundering funds for vengeful smugglers. Getz eventually leads them to the gang, but upon dispatching his would-be assassin and returning with backup they are confronted by Rudd, who invokes diplomatic immunity on behalf of his unscrupulous associates.
 Los Angeles Harbor. Two assassins attack Murtaugh at his home, but he kills them in the ensuing fight, though Getz is abducted in the process.

After killing several police officers, Vorstedt seizes Riggs at the van den Haas home and discloses that he was responsible for the death of Martins wife years earlier during a botched assassination. He succeeds in drowning Rika, but a vengeful Riggs manages to escape. He phones Murtaugh, declaring an intention to pursue Rudd and avenge their fallen friends; the other policeman willingly forsakes his badge to aid his partner. Rescuing Getz, they head for the Alba Varden, Rudds freighter, as the South Africans prepare their getaway with millions in drug money.

Riggs and Murtaugh stow away in a crate, engaging the ships crew when they are discovered. Riggs confronts and fights Vorstedt hand-to-hand, culminating when Riggs stabs Vorstedt and crushes him with a falling cargo container. Rudd retaliates by shooting Riggs in the back numerous times. Heedless of his claims to protected status, Murtaugh kills Rudd and tends to Riggs, sharing a laugh with him as more LAPD personnel respond to the scene.

 CPA who is placed in protective custody by Riggs and Murtaugh, and makes the detectives lives a living hell due to his neurotic behavior. The Getz character remained a regular throughout the remainder of the film series.

At two points in the film, Riggs intentionally dislocates his shoulder in order to get out of a straitjacket and then slams it back into place.  This becomes a running gag not only throughout the film series, but also throughout a lot of parody films.

The opening chase sequence was filmed on November 28, 1988. The scenes where Riggs and Rika are ambushed by helicopters at night on the beach were filmed at Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes California, on "Cobble Beach".

==Release==

===Box office performance===

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews, although not as many as the original.  , a hillside house blown off its stilts and a bomb set under a toilet, the point of Lethal Weapon 2 is that Mel Gibson and Danny Glover get to race around in all that chaos, acting crazy. Before it skids out of control in the final sequence, the film is so careful to preserve its successful comic-action formula that it follows the most basic law of sequels. If you liked Lethal Weapon, youll like Lethal Weapon 2; its almost as simple as that."  Los Angeles Times reviewer Michael Wilmington stated that "though its nice to have a big-audience action movie attacking apartheid and the slaughter of sea mammals, instead of acting as an enlistment poster for the Army Air Corps, local vigilante groups or the reopening of the Vietnam War, the sentiments dont really transcend the car crashes."  It currently holds an 83% approval on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews with an average rating of 6.6/10. Despite prominent anti-apartheid overtones and its somewhat crude depiction of Afrikaner characters, Lethal Weapon 2 was released uncensored in South Africa and proved a box-office success.

Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Richard Donner have all stated that this is their favorite film of the Lethal Weapon series. 

===Home media releases===
Lethal Weapon 2 has been released on VHS and DVD numerous times, along with a singular Blu-ray Disc release.  The first DVD was released in 1997 and featured the films theatrical version.  The Directors Cut was released in 2000.  Since then, numerous sets have been released that contain all four films in the series (featuring the same DVDs).
