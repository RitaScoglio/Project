== Plot ==

In a Tombstone, Arizona saloon Ben Carter owns, the sheriff is unwilling to stop Indian Charlie from shooting up the place, so new arrival Wyatt Earp does. Earp is beaten by some of Carters hired men for taking the law into his own hands.

Dance hall girl Jerry is upset with Earp, so when her sweetheart Doc Halliday gets to town, a showdown seems imminent. Earp and Doc instead become friends. Earp takes over as the lawman in town and also tries to convince Docs former sweetheart Sarah Allen that their relationship can still work out.

The two men work together after visiting entertainer Eddie Foy is taken captive, and also when Jenny joins forces with Carter to plan the robbery of a gold shipment. Doc is forced to perform surgery to save a life, then is shot in the back by Carter. Earp avenges his friends death.

== Origins ==
 Sadie and he had gone to great lengths to keep her name out of the book, and she threatened litigation to keep it that way.    

In 1934, she had successfully forced the producers to excise her husbands name from the first movie. In 1939, Josephine Earp sued 20th Century Fox for $50,000 in an attempt to keep them from making the second film titled Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal. With the provision that Wyatts name be removed from the title, and after receiving a $5,000 settlement,    the movie was released as Frontier Marshal.   

In Los Angeles, Josephine became friends with many celebrities, including Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper.  She received part of the money made by Stuart Lakes book about her husband as well as royalties from the movie.
