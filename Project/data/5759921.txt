The play was filmed in 1969 - produced, once again, by Michael Medwin - and the result is a valuable time-capsule in that it depicts a Bolton of large, long-gone chimneys. Other parts of the film show street scenes and wide shots of the town as it was at the time of filming. It was filmed as St. Peters Way was being constructed and whilst many of the old industrial buildings remained. The lives depicted are very real for the period and this film captures an industrial town in transformation.
 Susan George, Peter Hammond. Naughton himself provided the adaptation, and it was filmed on location in Bolton and at Lee International Studios in Wembley, London.

The movie was the first film shot at Elstree Studios after Bryan Forbes took over. 

After the film version, Naughtons play returned to its radio roots no fewer than three times, featuring in the BBCs Afternoon Theatre strand in August 1975, July 1979 and July 1982.
