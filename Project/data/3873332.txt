==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic Craig Butler had problems with the script. He wrote, "The Second Woman is an intriguing if frustrating little thriller -- frustrating because it verges on being very good but settles for being merely OK. Part of the problem is that Woman combines elements of various styles -- film noir, psychological drama, mystery, thriller, romance -- but doesnt meld them into a satisfying whole ... All in all, The Second Woman is a good attempt that is worth watching, even if it falls short of reaching its goals." 

Film critic Dennis Schwartz was also disappointed, "Robert Young gives a subdued performance that is somewhat credible but not all that endearing. The films ultimate villain is the real estate industry that is spoiling the natural beauty in its need to make lots of money. But the brooding melodrama, thought of by many as film noir, never seemed vibrant as a thriller."
