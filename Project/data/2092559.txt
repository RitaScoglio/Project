===Deleted scenes=== GAF View-Master reel set for the film shows a still from a deleted sequence where one of Hawks nightmares has him about to be treated by a pair of white VW Beetle doctors, who decide to "take his carburetor out and have a look at it".  As they approach Hawk, he is woken by Loostgarten.

===Props===
The Herbies used for the film consisted both of 1963 and 1965 Beetles.

The included 1965 models make for some bad continuity errors as the windows are noticeably larger on the 1965 cars.  This was to become worse in subsequent Herbie films as even later model cars were included.

One of the VW Beetles used in the deleted nightmare sequence (see above) was first used in The Love Bug as a stunt car during the El Dorado race (also used for interior filming). Many years after Herbie Rides Again, the cars red cross, mechanical arms, and eyeball headlights were removed and restored to former appearance.
 Sears Tower took that honor in 1974.)
