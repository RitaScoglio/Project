==Plot==
The first act of the film covers Lincolns early life as a storekeeper and rail-splitter in New Salem and his early romance with Ann Rutledge, and his early years as a lawyer and his courtship and marriage to Mary Todd in Springfield. The majority of the film deals with Lincolns presidency during the Civil War and culminates with Lees surrender and Lincolns assassination at Fords Theatre.

The film covers some little-known aspects of Lincolns early life, such as his romance with Ann Rutledge, his depression and feared suicidal tendencies after her death, and his unexplained breaking off of his engagement with Mary Todd (although the film surmises that this was due to unresolved feelings over Ann Rutledge and adds a dramatic scene where Lincoln stands Mary up on their scheduled wedding day, which never happened).
 Second Inaugural Address at Fords Theatre on April 14, 1865 - just moments before being assassinated. This was Griffiths second portrayal of Lincolns assassination, the first being in The Birth of a Nation.

==Reception== John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that it was "by and large.....a pretty high-grade picture."  Despite these accolades, however, the films box office performance was uneven. 

More recent assessments of Abraham Lincoln have less effusive in their praise, finding that it has not aged well. In 1978, the film was included as one of the choices in the book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time, criticizing the films historical inaccuracies, instances of clumsy dialogue and Merkels melodramatic acting style.  Glenn Erickson, reviewing the DVD in 2012, wrote that it "comes off as an interesting curio. Its earnest simplicity seems more dated than ever, despite the fine performance of Walter Huston in the lead role."  Film historian Melvyn Stokes found that Abraham Lincolns episodic structure "came at the cost of dramatic tension" and suggested that the films disappointing box office performance was due to its having "nothing of major importance and relevance to say about its subject to moviegoers of Depression-era America."
