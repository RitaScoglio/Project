}} 1986 film of the same name. While many of the same characters and plot twists are maintained, a few smaller occurrences are left out. Filmed under communist Chinese censorship, some portions of Clavells story were considered too offensive to be filmed as written and considerable changes were made. 
 production and Chinese Government Noble House would have been a far superior means of covering the complexity of Clavells novel.

==Plot== British victory of the First Opium War and the seizure of Hong Kong. Although the island is largely uninhabited and the terrain unfriendly, it has a large port that both the British government and various trading companies believe will be useful for the import of merchandise to be traded on mainland China, a highly lucrative Market (economics)|market.

Although the film features many Fictional character|characters, it is arguably Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock, former shipmates and the owners of two massive (fictional) trading companies who are the main focal points of the story. Their rocky and often abusive relationship as seamen initiated an intense amount of competitive tension.
 Chinese trade.

While the film follows a similar structure as the novel, one major and notable event is left out. Struans meeting with Jin Qua early in the film to obtain the forty lac dollars of silver to pay Brock omits Jin Quas stipulation that four special coins be broken in half, with Struan keeping four halves and the other four being distributed by Jin Qua. When a half coin is presented to Struan that matches his own half, he is obligated to do a favor to the bearer. The first favor is called in later in the novel, by the pirate Wu Kwok. The film does not convey this.

Patrick McGoohan was announced to play Dirk Struan in the film with Michael Anderson  attached to direct. However the movie would have cost an estimated $26 million (later reduced to $20 million MGM Wont Drop Plans for Tai-Pan
Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File)   29 July 1968: g15. ) and was postponed.   It lingered on for a number of years before being finally cancelled by James T. Aubrey. New King of MGMs Jungle Cracking Whip: New King of the MGM Jungle New King of the MGM Jungle
