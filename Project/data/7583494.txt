==Plot== pornographic magazine hustler for money.  Soon, he meets Remigio (Jerry Hernandez), a teen hustler and drug dealer, and the two become friends and live together.

Ethan and Remigio plan to go to Ethans old home over the Thanksgiving holiday (when Ethan knows everyone will be away visiting other family) to get money and Ethans deceased mothers necklace—which he feels is the only thing he has to remember her by.  But when the family returns to the house to pick up a forgotten gift—while Ethan and Remigio are inside—they are forced to take everyone hostage.

The plan is to hold Ethans father Abraham, Sarah, stepbrother Josh (Kevin Kleinberg), and younger brother Noel in the home until the next day when the banks open and Sarah can go to the safety deposit box and retrieve Ethans mothers necklace.  Everything goes smoothly until Sarah leaves for the bank and decides to call the police.

As the police surround the house, Ethan and Remigio are forced to make a choice about how everything will come to an end. They decide to walk out together and give themselves up to the police. After they kiss, the film cuts to them on bed together without lights on. Remigio asks Ethan to "let   know" when Ethan falls in love with anyone "no matter where  ". Ethan responds positively that, if he falls in love with anyone, he will make Remigio the first person to kiss.
