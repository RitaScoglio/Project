Tombs of the Blind Dead is a 1971 Spanish horror film written and directed by Amando de Ossorio.  Its original Spanish title is La noche del terror ciego,  which means "The Night of the Blind Terror". The film is the first in Ossorios Blind Dead series, and its success helped kickstart the Spanish horror film boom of the early Seventies.

==Plot==
 
The Knights Templar (a fictionalized version of a real-life order that was dissolved in the 14th century following charges of witchcraft and heresy) come back from the dead as Revenant (folklore)|revenants. The reanimated corpses are blind, because their eyes were pecked out by birds while their hanged bodies rotted on the gallows.

A young couple run into an old friend on vacation. The man invites the woman along for a train journey, but his girlfriend argues with him, jumps off the train and spends the night in the ruins of an abandoned monastery where the Templars are buried. The Templars rise from their tombs and kill her. The rest of the movie follows the efforts of the victims boyfriend to find out what happened to her.  He returns to the monastery with some friends where they are forced to confront the Blind Dead creatures.

==Production==
Although the Knights are identifiable by their uniforms, they are never called "Templars" in the film; they are referred to as "Knights from the East".  Ossorio objected to the description of the revenant Templars as "zombies", insisting that they more resembled mummies who feed like vampires and that, unlike zombies, the Templars were not mindless corpses. 

The Spanish version, La Noche del Terror Ciego, differs from the English version Tombs of the Blind Dead. In the English version, a flashback of the living Knights Templar torturing a victim is moved to the beginning of the film, and most of the gore (in particular, a sequence on a train in which a woman is murdered in front of her child) is removed.   

Distributors planned to severely re-edit the film for its English language release and add a new opening scene to cash in on the success of the Planet of the Apes film series. The plan was to replace the films original setting with a post-Apocalyptic future in which the undead were deceased intelligent apes, similar to the ones seen in Planet of the Apes. Rather than doing a reshoot, location footage from the film was edited together and a narration track explaining the premise was produced as an introduction. The revised film title is Revenge from Planet Ape. This revised version removed the flashback sequences showing the sadistic Templars torturing and drinking the blood of a woman to gain eternal life.

The Blue Underground DVD contains both versions of the film (the original Spanish version is subtitled but not dubbed) and the "Planet of the Apes" opening sequence. 

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 57% of seven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.5/10.   Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle says, "Spanish filmmaker de Ossorio earned international fame with this widely popular tale of blind zombie monks, creating a fresh mythology and unforgettable zombies, all set against imposing scenic backgrounds." 

Allmovie gave the film a positive review, praising the films make up effects, chilling atmosphere, and soundtrack. 
TV Guide awarded the film 2 / 4 stars and called it, "a slow and lackadaisically plotted thirsty-corpse movie distinguished by terrific music and locations, and genuinely eerie zombies".  Brett H. from Oh the Horror! gave the film a positive review stating, "Tombs of the Blind Dead is a slow moving Spanish classic that is a must see for all fans of creature features with ample amounts of all the things that make horror great. It’s not perfect and it does have some small inconsistencies (why in the world are the Templars so powerful, yet sometimes swing their swords like goofy puppets?), but youll be too engulfed in the atmosphere and monsters to worry too much about it".   Jeremy Zoss from Film Threat gave the film a negative review stating, "Like many old works of entertainment form Mexico, Tombs of the Blind Dead is not without its charms. It would be a great film to watch while drunk with a group of friends. However, when looking for a real horror film, the Blind Dead are definitely not worth seeing".   Critic John Kenneth Muir identifies passion as one of the main themes of the film.  When characters experience passion, such as sexual desire, the knights become interested and kill them.   Adam Tyner of DVD Talk wrote, "Although Tombs of the Blind Dead isnt a  particularly gory film, several of its sequences are deeply unsettling".
