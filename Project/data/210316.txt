==Overview==
Gerry is about two   and Casey Affleck already had used the term before the movie had been named. 
 Rattlesnake Canyon in New Mexico.

==Plot==
The characters drive to a remote location to hike at a site marked "Wilderness Trail". As they start, they see some other hikers passing by. After some walking, talking, and an impromptu foot race, they decide to head back. Before long, they realize that they are lost. That night, they build a campfire.

Over the next couple of days, the two hikers wander through the wilderness without food or water. They try splitting up for a while, they try to retrace their steps, they try to follow some animal tracks, all to no avail. They grow increasingly irritated with each other as the situation becomes dire.
 fatigue and dehydration. The weaker of the two (Affleck) proclaims that he is "leaving", and reaches towards Damons character. Damons character rolls on top of Affleck and wordlessly strangles him before collapsing again. 

After some time, Damons character awakens and discovers that a highway is not far away. In the final sequence, he is badly sunburned but watches the passing landscape from the car of the father and son who have seemingly rescued him.

==Production==
It was shot in a semi-improvised style with a small crew in the province of Salta in Argentina, Death Valley, and the Utah Salt Flats.

The film is dedicated to the memory of Ken Kesey.
