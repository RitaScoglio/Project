==Production== Fritz the comic strip underground cartoonist", and agreed to fund the film. 

Production began in 1972. However, Steve Krantz had not yet paid Bakshi for his work on Fritz the Cat. Halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked Krantz outright when he would be paid, and Krantz responded that "The picture didnt make any money, Ralph. Its just a lot of noise."  Bakshi found Krantzs claims to be dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Because Bakshi did not have a lawyer, he sought advice from directors he had become friends with, including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg, asking them how much they made on their films. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied.  Bakshi began pitching his next project, Harlem Nights, a film loosely based on the Uncle Remus story books. The idea interested producer Albert S. Ruddy during a screening of The Godfather.      

While working on Heavy Traffic, Bakshi received a call from Krantz, who questioned him about Harlem Nights. Bakshi told Krantz: "I cant talk about that" and hung up. The next day, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio, reportedly tapping Bakshis phone because he was wary of his loyalty as an employee.  After Krantz fired Bakshi, he began to seek a replacement director for Heavy Traffic, calling several directors, including Chuck Jones.  Arkoff threatened to pull the films budget unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, who returned a week later.  During the films production, Krantz attempted to maintain some level of control by issuing memos to Bakshi and other artists requesting various changes. John Sparey remembers being issued a memo asking Sparey to stop posting caricatures of Krantz on the middle of his door. 
 Scarborough Fair" soundtrack album was released in 1973. 

===Directing===
 
Inspiration for the film came from penny arcades, where Bakshi would often spend his time playing pinball, sometimes bringing his 12-year-old son Mark. Bakshi wanted to use pinball as a metaphor to examine the ways of the world.  Heavy Traffic began a tradition in which Bakshi would write poems before beginning production on each of his films, starting with Street Arabs.  According to Bakshi, "My background was in Brooklyn â€” my Jewishness, my family life, my father coming from Russia. All these things had to be somehow represented on film." 
 ad lib during the recording sessions.  According to James Bates, the voice of Snowflake, "I said, How about a little Wolfman Jack, Charles Nelson Reilly, Pearl Bailey and a little Truman Capote? Ralph couldnt believe it. We ad-libbed a lot, and he usually got what he wanted in three or four takes. We worked hard and not for much coin, but it was a blast." 

As with Fritz the Cat, Bakshi and Johnnie Vita took location photographs for the films backgrounds. Instead of tracing the photographs onto backgrounds, as they had done in Fritz the Cat, the film uses actual photographs and live-action stock footage as backgrounds for much of the film.  Bakshi and Vita were also experimental in their photography: Bakshi requested that the lab technicians produce several prints for every photo, each print increasingly out of focus, giving the backgrounds a fuzzy quality. Bakshi states that "We didnt want to risk shooting   on the spot. That could have meant making some expensive mistakes." 

===Animation===
According to animator Mark Kausler, Krantz was so nervous about showing too much nudity and sexual activities that he had several versions of some sequences animated, for instance, in the "Maybellene" animation sequence. Kausler says that a sequence was animated in which the viewer sees "the key in the ignition metamorphose into a penis entering Maybellines vagina."    This sequence was deleted from Heavy Traffic, but the same action appeared in the film Down and Dirty Duck.  Kausler also states:

 "I covered this scene with another one of the key changing into the fat black guy, and the ignition slot turning into Maybellene. I covered a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black mans face with his hand covering his eyes. You can get a sense of how many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version "A" of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but I have not seen it since I worked on it. We did versions "A," B", and "C," with "C" being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called "X" version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of was the guy in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guys ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action."  

Edward Hoppers famous 1942 painting Nighthawks was used as a background in one of the films sequences.  Several animation sequences appear as rough sketchbook pages, including a dream sequence influenced by the work of Otto Messmer and a George Herriman-influenced sequence set to Chuck Berrys "Maybellene".   

==Response== X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, more theaters were willing to screen adult-oriented animated features because of the success of Fritz the Cat, and Heavy Traffic was a box office success.  Ralph Bakshi was the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films back-to-back.  The film is considered to be Bakshis biggest critical success. Newsweek wrote that the film contained "black humor, powerful grotesquerie and peculiar raw beauty. Episodes of violence and sexuality are both explicit and parodies of flesh-and-blood porn   a celebration of urban decay."  Charles Champlin wrote in The New York Times that the film was "furious energy, uncomfortable to watch as often as it is hilarious."  The Hollywood Reporter called it "shocking, outrageous, offensive, sometimes incoherent, occasionally unintelligent. However, it is also an authentic work of movie art and Bakshi is certainly the most creative American animator since Walt Disney|Disney."  Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 88%.  Vincent Canby ranked it among his "Ten Best Films of 1973".  The film was banned by the film censorship board in the province of Alberta, Canada when it was originally released. 
 Michael Barrier, an animation historian, described Heavy Traffic and Fritz the Cat as "not merely provocative, but highly ambitious." Barrier described the films as an effort "to push beyond what was done in the old cartoons, even while building on their strengths." 

==Home Video==

An R-rated version was released in a Region 1 VHS and DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on 1999. On July 16, 2013, Shout Factory and MGM released Heavy Traffic on Blu-ray for its 40th anniversary.
