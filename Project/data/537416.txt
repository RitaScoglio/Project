==Plot== consulate in the fictional African country of Nibia. Because Aces influence is disruptive to the monastery, the Grand Abbot gives Ace excuses to justify his departure, and sends him with Greenwall.
 white bat Shikaka, a sacred animal of the Wachati tribe, which disappeared shortly after being offered as dowry of the Wachati Princess, who is set to wed the Wachootoo Prince to form armistice between the two people. Accompanied by his capuchin monkey, Spike, Ace travels to Africa to search for the missing bat.
 fear of bats in order to succeed. He travels to the Wachati tribal village, where he learns that if the bat is not returned in time, the Wachootoo will declare war on the Wachati tribe. Thereafter much of Aces activity involves eliminating obvious suspects—animal traders, poachers, and a Safari park owner among others—and enduring the growing escalations of threat between the Wachati and the Wachootoo. This proves difficult, and is made more so by other incidents including attempts to kill him, a series of gruelling tasks set by the Wachootoo, and the Wachati princess attempts to seduce him.

Perplexed by the case, Ace consults the Grand Abbot via astral projection. Advised by the Abbot, Ace deduces that Vincent Cadby has taken the bat and hired Ace to divert suspicion from himself, having planned to let the tribes destroy each other so that he can then take possession of the numerous bat caves containing guano to sell as fertilizer worth billions. When Ace confronts Cadby with this knowledge, Ace learns he was hired as Cadbys alibi, and he is arrested by tribal security chief, Hitu. Shortly after, Ace calls an elephant to escape, and summons herds of jungle animals to destroy Cadbys house. Cadby then tries to shoot Ace, but is thwarted by Greenwall who punches him in the face. Cadby escapes with the bat in a car, but Ace follows him in a Monster truck. In pursuit, Ace destroys Cadbys car, leaving the bat cage lodged in a tree.

Ace, despite his chiroptophobia, dramatically returns the bat just as the tribes are charging on a field to fight; and Cadby, watching nearby, is discovered by the Wachati prince, Ouda, and pursued by both tribes, later to be raped by an amorous silverback gorilla. The Princess is married to the Prince, who Ace had to fight as one of the Wachootoo tribal challenges. Moments later, it is discovered that the young bride is no longer a virgin, apparently on Aces account. Both tribes then pursue Ace, concluding the movie.

==Production notes==
 
The movie was set in a fictional location in Africa but was actually shot in various locations in and around Charleston, South Carolina.

Part of the film was shot in San Antonio, Texas and British Columbia, Canada.

When listing other words that start with "sh-" after hearing of the Shikaka, Ace includes "Shawshank Redemption". This may be a nod to actor Bob Gunton, as he appears in both films. Also, when Ace has Bob Guntons character, Burton Quinn, tied to a chair, Ace calls him "Sweeney Toad", a reference to his having played the title character in a theater production of Sweeney Todd.

==Alternative versions==
 
When aired in syndication, there is an alternative version of the rhino scene (wherein Ace escapes with difficulty from within a mechanical rhinoceros) in which Ace stands up after emerging from the rhino and shouts "Man, was I lost!".

In order to receive a PG certificate, the UK release of the film features a number of cuts, equalling one minute and 35 seconds for the theatrical release, plus a further three seconds when re-classified for home video. These cut scenes include:

* Elements of the raccoon rescue attempt; Bumblebee tuna!" to a crouching tribe member;
* Aces snorting when displaying his affection to the chief;
* A scene wherein Greenwall catches Ace masturbating, made more explicit by Aces shadow on the wall and some of Aces speech;
* Some images of Ace prodding his eyeball while interrogating Quinn;
* A scene in which, after removing the apple core from one Wachootoos throat, Ace pushes a baby out of a pregnant Wachootoo woman; and
* During Aces duel, the warrior stands on Ace and tears the spears from his legs.

During the projector scene, the U.K. version features Ace casting bird-like shadows with both hands, as opposed to the single hand in the original release.

This film was shot in Super 35, so the fullscreen version is open matte, and reveals more to the top and bottom of the screen (sections that were not actually intended to be seen); it also crops the sides.
