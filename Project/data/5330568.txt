== Storyline ==
Volume One opens with Stacey serving in the court of Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, where she dons the famous metal bikini to rescue Han Solo from carbonite. However, Princess Leia, Solos new girlfriend, manages to rescue him first. Disgusted by Hans affection towards Leia, Stacey abandons the rebels and travels to the second Death Star. While waiting for the Palpatine|Emperor, she duels with Darth Vader before letting slip the Rebels plans to attack the station, and the fact that Leia is actually Vaders daughter. Volume One ends on a cliffhanger, with Stacey apparently signing on as the Emperors new apprentice.

Volume Two opens with the arrival of the Rebel fleet at the Death Star. After a brief entreaty from the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Stacey heads to the surface to "rescue" Han again. She enlists C-3PO, R2-D2 and the Ewoks as a diversion, but abandons the rescue attempt after overhearing Solo tell the princess of his love. Afterward, she learns from the spirit of Yoda that the rebels are unaware of a second shield around the Death Star reactor. The film ends on yet another cliffhanger as she is manipulated by Yoda into returning to the Death Star to deactivate the second shield.
