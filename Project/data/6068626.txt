 porn chic in the US.  It starred Marilyn Chambers and was directed by Stu Segall (credited as "Godfrey Daniels"). Williams, p.150  It was followed by a 1984 sequel, Insatiable II, also directed by Daniels.  The series was "enormously popular",  and the first film was the top-selling adult video in the U.S. from 1980-1982. Williams, p.175  

==Overview==
Chambers plays the rich, happy and assertive fashion model Sandra Chase, whose sexual appetite is --per the title-- insatiable. The film begins as it ends, with her masturbating. She has an old-fashioned aunt who appears in a series of flashbacks. The movie has little plot or storyline, and "only the barest minimum of real-world narrative conflict."  It consists mainly of one sex scene after another with some filler sequences added to pad the runtime to feature-length movie standards. While one scene has Chamberss character overhearing her friend having sex, all the other "action" scenes features Chambers as an active participant.  
 Serena perform Ferrari Dino.

In the third scene, presented as a flashback, Sandra is ravished on a snooker table by the gardener of her fathers estate (played by David Morris). The incident is revealed to be Chambers characters first sexual experience, and may be meant to explain her later sexual behaviour. The scene has been called "uncommonly brutal". Although Chambers says, "No, please stop," the movie makes it clear she is a willing participant, as she tells her friend, "I just loved being held down and made love to by him".
 John Leslie. John Holmes.  As soon as Holmes is finished, Chambers utters her last line of the movie whilst masturbating: "More, more, more." 

The film was followed by a sequel, Insatiable II, in 1984.
