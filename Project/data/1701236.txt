Its soundtrack, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (soundtrack)|Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, features new versions of songs originally written and performed by The Beatles. The film draws primarily from two of their albums, 1967s Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and 1969s Abbey Road. The film covers all of the songs from the Sgt. Pepper album with the exceptions of "Within You, Without You" and "Lovely Rita", and also includes nearly all of Abbey Road.

It tells the loosely-constructed story of a band as they wrangle with the music industry and battle evil forces bent on stealing their instruments and corrupting their home town of Heartland. The film is presented in a form similar to that of a rock opera with the Beatles songs providing "dialogue" to carry the story, with only George Burns having spoken lines that act to clarify the plot and provide further narration.

===Special guests===
Additionally, the film becomes a time capsule of late 1970s pop culture with the last scene in which the cast is joined by "Our Guests at Heartland" to sing the reprise of the title track while standing in a formation imitating the Beatles Sgt. Pepper album cover. The scene was filmed at MGM Studios on December 16, 1977; indeed, according to co-star Carel Struycken (Mustards henchman, "Brute"), Sgt. Pepper was the last film to be made at MGM under that studios then existing management.

==Production== Broadway show  called Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road, which was produced by The Robert Stigwood Organization.  Stigwood had purchased the rights to use 29 Beatles songs for the play and was determined to do something with them, so he brought the songs to Henry Edwards to write a script.    Edwards had never written a script for a film, but had impressed Stigwood with musical analysis hed written for The New York Times.  "I spread the songs out on my apartment floor and went to work," said Edwards.  "Mr Stigwood wanted a concept. I told him Id like to do a big MGM-like musical. Wed synthesize forms and end up with an MGM musical but with the music of today."

With a script in place, the cast was assembled. In the spring of 1977, Peter Frampton, The Bee Gees, and George Martin met to begin work on the soundtrack.  Filming started in October 1977 on the backlot of MGM Studios in Culver City, where the set of Heartland, USA was built. Interiors were filmed at Universal City Studios.

==Critical reaction==
Upon release the film received scathingly negative reviews, with critics taking issue with its thin plot and incomprehensibility. The film has however been praised for its musical renditions of classic Beatles songs, and has since gained a cult following. As of September 1, 2014, review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes reports that 15% of 20 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 2.9 out of 10. 

According to movie historian Leonard Maltin, the picture "...ranges from tolerable to embarrassing and just doesnt work. As for the Bee Gees acting talents, if you cant say something nice..."

Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the films "musical numbers are strung together so mindlessly that the movie has the feel of an interminable variety show"; while it may have been "conceived in a spirit of merriment, ... watching it feels like playing  shuffleboard  at the absolute insistence of a bossy shipboard social director. When whimsy gets to be this overbearing, it simply isnt whimsy any more." She complimented Martin on his "completely unhinged rendition of "Maxwells Silver Hammer," but pointed out that his scene is a "reminder that the film is otherwise humorless." 

Newsweeks David Ansen called Sgt. Pepper "a film with a dangerous resemblance to wallpaper."   

Rolling Stone writer Paul Nelson shredded virtually every aspect of the production, from stars Peter Frampton (of whom he wrote had "Absolutely no future in Hollywood") to director Michael Schultz ("Would seem to need direction merely to find the set, let alone the camera") to the soundtrack album ("The album proves conclusively that you cant go home again in 1978. Or, if you do, youd better be aware of whos taken over the neighborhood."). 
 high camp moments" featuring Martin, Burns; Earth, Wind & Fire; Aerosmith, and Billy Preston who "somehow transcend the jaw-dropping inanity that poisons the rest of the cast." 
 The Intelligencer s Lou Gaul called the film "A sort of modern Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia for todays teens."  The Valley Independents Ron Paglia called it "Good, campy fun," citing Steve Martins performance as "a high point," and the celebrity filled finale as "something special" before concluding "theres much to enjoy."
