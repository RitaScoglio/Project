==Plot==
Lisa Walker (Mary Stuart Masterson) is a business executive who has gotten used to being alone but doesnt like it very much. She was abandoned by her birth parents, and then spent most of her childhood being raised by Stanley (S.A. Griffin), a foster father who never really loves Lisa (and its implied that he molested her), after her adopted mother died. One day, Lisa gets word that Stanley has died; alone in her apartment, after attempting to feed her now dead pet fish, she breaks down and cries uncontrollably. The next day at work, Lisa gets an unexpected delivery of flowers from a secret admirer. Puzzled, Lisa presses the delivery man for information on who might have sent her the flowers, and he confessesâ€”he sent them himself. Lewis (Christian Slater) runs a flower shop and often takes long walks through the neighborhood, trying to lose his memories of his deceased wife and child. He saw Lisa crying in her window and hoped the roses would cheer her up. Before long, Lisa and Lewis begin dating, but both have some emotional issues to resolve before their story can have a happy ending.
