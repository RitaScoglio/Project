==Reception==

===Critical===
  at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.]] musical score and use of a handheld camera throughout its production as a major factor in its overall tone. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 89% of critics gave positive reviews, with a rating average of 7.6 out of 10.  Metacritic rated Rosetta 76 out of 100.     The Arts and Faith website ranks Rosetta at number 33 in its "Top 100 Spiritually Significant Films" list as of December 2006. 

Derek Elley of Variety (magazine)|Variety notes the film is "Anchored by a performance of grim determination and almost feral instincts from its lead actress, Rosetta is an extremely small European art movie from Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne that will alienate as many viewers as it wins over."  Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave a more critical review due to the prevalent gloom, stating Rosetta " is so clinically detached from its subject and its screenplay so minimal that we never really feel the title characters intense suffering or even get to know her very well. As she spirals into despair, the films heavy, social-realist angst feels more than a little contrived...Instead of feeling universal, the movie feels claustrophobic."  In his review for Boston Globe Jay Carr surmises, "The bleakness of Rosetta will not be for all, but its one of the best films of the year." 

  reviewing for Chicago Reader extolled the film as showing an extraordinary capability of maintaining an objective view into the world of the protagonist and "the most visceral filmgoing experience of the past year, including all of Hollywoods explosions and special-effects extravaganzas". 
 Joel Coen reviewing for LExpress highly recommended Rosetta to readers regardless of polarization because of its tenacious depiction of youth straining to preserve their integrity while bearing adult responsibilities and the effective use of the camera to capture the essence of the protagonist.  Marine Landrot writing for Télérama gave additional praise to Rosetta, noting the role reversal between Rosetta and her mother signified the inherent desire in childhood comforts as both yield to the pressures afflicted by modern society.
