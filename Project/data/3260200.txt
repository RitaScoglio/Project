 emissary of Hades to scare Scrooge straight.

==Plot==
Scrooge (Yosemite Sam) is counting money in the counting house of his firm when Bob Cratchit (Porky) comes in, wanting to borrow a lump of coal as he is freezing. Scrooge refuses, and just after this Bugs comes in with Christmas decorations and mistletoe. He is tossed out, and decides that "somebody oughta teach that little humbug some Christmas spirit". Bugs then borrows a piece of coal and places it in the office of Cratchit, who graciously thanks him.
 carolers (Elmer Tiny Tim (Tweety Bird). "Kinda puny, isnt he?" Bugs notes. "If you had to live on birdseed, youd be puny too!" Tim retorts. Scrooge sends the light company to take the last candle (as Cratchit is past due) and a notice that the house is being foreclosed, forcing Cratchit to move out by midnight. Bugs decides this is the last straw.

First, Bugs annoys Scrooge with carolers, causing him to go out to deal with him and he slips. Next, he puts snow into Scrooges hot bath. He then acts like a ghost dragging around chains and  beating a drum, which causes Scrooge to investigate. He does so, and accidentally slips down the stairs and into the cold along with Sylvester. They go back to bed, but Bugs appears acting like a ghost. Sylvester quickly flees, but Scrooge is stopped by the door closing. As the ghost, Bugs threatens to take Scrooge to see "the man in the red suit" (the Devil, though Scrooge first guesses Santa Claus). Scrooge quickly promises to change.

He immediately makes good on his promise, giving money to the poor and making Bob Cratchit a partner in his firm. Tweety raises a toast to him, and Bugs kisses him. Scrooge (now going by the name of Sam) still hates kissing, though.
 Roadrunner (Freeze Freeze Frame) begins, Sam asks Cratchit and his family to give all his money back to him.
