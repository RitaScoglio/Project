== Critical reception ==
Into The Night has a rating of 38% on  s cocaine-zonked wife in Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface, is so beautiful that one is apt not to notice that she has the potential for being a fine comedienne."  Variety (magazine)|Variety held a similar view, writing that the "film itself tries sometimes too hard for laughs and at other times strains for shock," while also praising the performance of Jeff Goldblum, "nonetheless enjoyable as he constantly tries to figure out just what hes doing in all of this." 

Some critics saw the large number of cameo appearances by Landiss friends and colleagues as unnecessary and distracting.   wrote: "The casting of innumerable major film-makers in small roles seems an unnecessary bit of elbow-jogging, but David Bowie makes an excellent contribution as an English hit man, and the two leading players are excellent: Pfeiffer in particular takes the sort of glamorous yet preposterous part that generally defeats even the best actress and somehow contrives to make it credible every inch of the way." 

Into The Night won the Special Jury Prize at the 1985 Festival du Film Policier de Cognac.
