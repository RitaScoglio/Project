 Cecil B. DeMille Carmen of 1915 which was itself an interpretation of the popular novella Carmen (novella)|Carmen by Prosper Mérimée.    Composer Hugo Riesenfeld wrote the music for both the DeMille and the Chaplin films, based on George Bizets opera Carmen.

Chaplins original version was a tightly paced two-reeler, but in 1916 after Chaplin had moved to Mutual Film|Mutual, Essanay reworked the film into a four-reel version called A Burlesque on Carmen, or Burlesque on Carmen, adding discarded footage and new scenes involving a subplot about a gypsy character played by Ben Turpin. This longer version was deeply flawed in pacing and continuity, not representative of Chaplins initial conception. Chaplin sued Essanay but failed to stop the distribution of the longer version; Essanays tampering with this and other of his films contributed significantly to Chaplins bitterness about his time there. The presence of Essanays badly redone version is likely the reason that Burlesque on Carmen is among the least known of Chaplins works. Historian Ted Okuda calls the two-reel original version the best film of Chaplins Essanay period, but derides the longer version as the worst.   
 Kino produced David Shepard, who studied Chaplins court transcripts and other evidence to more closely reproduce the original Chaplin cut.  The highly regarded Kino release is accompanied by a Robert Israel score.

==Background== Raoul Walsh Cecil B. William to base his scenario on the public domain novella Carmen (novella)|Carmen by Prosper Mérimée. William included a cigarette factory fight scene from the book which was not found in the opera.  Composer Hugo Riesenfeld arranged the music, based on George Bizets opera Carmen.  DeMilles film received positive reviews  but Chaplin thought it was ripe for parody.

==Synopsis==
 
Carmen, a gypsy seductress is sent to convince Darn Hosiery, the goofy officer in charge of guarding one of the entrances to the city of Sevilla, to allow a smuggling run. She first tries to bribe him but he takes the money and refused to let the smuggled goods in. 

She then invites him to Lillas Pastias inn where she seduces him. After a fight at the tobacco factory where Carmen works, he has to arrest her but later lets her escape. At Lillas Pastias inn, he kills an officer who is also in love with her and has to go into hiding and he joins the gang of smugglers.

Carmen meets the famous toreador Escamillo and falls in love with him. She accompanies him to a bull fight but Darn Hosiery waits for her and when she tells him that she no longer loves him, he stabs her to death. But it is not for real, Chaplin shows that the knife was fake and both smile at the camera.

==Production== breaking the fourth wall, turning to the camera to show laughingly that his character had not really killed Carmen.    The film was released in two reels at the end of 1915 when Chaplins contract with Essanay Studios was up. After he had left, the studio added two reels worth of additional non-Chaplin material and re-released the film in 1916. 

==Music== David Shepard.]]
Hugo Riesenfeld wrote the original score for the film, based on Georges Bizets opera score. 

Robert Israel wrote the score for the 1999 Kino release.

A score was commissioned from Timothy Brock by Teatro de la Zarzuela de Madrid, and released in 2013 by the Cineteca di Bologna and Lobster Films for their Chaplin Essanay Project. Brock based his score on the opera by Bizet, to be performed in a 1920s style.
