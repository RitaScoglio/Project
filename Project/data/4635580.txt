On the advice of ‘Auto’ (Vivek (actor)|Vivek), Natarajan brings Subramani (R. Madhavan|Madhavan) who charades himself as ‘Bottle Mani’, a dreaded thug to vacate the students. Incidentally Mani, who stays with his Jailor uncle (R. Sundarrajan), was thrown out of his house as he refuses to marry his daughter. Taking advantage of the situation, Mani befriends the five boys and starts staying with them.

Priya (Sadha) is the daughter of a wealthy gangster (Fefsi Vijayan) and she is engaged to an affluent sadist ACP (Rahman (actor)|Rahman). On the day of marriage Priya comes to know that her fiancée is already married and had murdered his first wife in a sadistic manner but her father forces her to marry him to cover up his illegal activities. She consumes poison just before the wedding time but was mistakenly kidnapped by Mani and Auto.
