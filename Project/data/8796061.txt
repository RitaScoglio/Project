==Plot== wizard named Zoc (Nicolas Cage), tries to fight back but is overwhelmed by Lucas. His girlfriend, a nurse ant named Hova (Julia Roberts), attempts to communicate with Lucas, but is saved by Zoc from being crushed just in time. The leaders of the colony decide to use a potion to shrink Lucas down to ant size as punishment for aiding destruction on the anthill. His parents, who fail to understand his problems, go to Puerto Vallarta, leaving him with his older sister, Tiffany, and their grandmother, who is obsessed over extraterrestrial life|aliens. 
  hard labor. Hova volunteers to train him, much to Zocs objections. Soon afterwards, they become friends learing more about differences between ants and humans. But when she forces him to forage for jelly beans with Kreela (Regina King) and her husband, Fugax (Bruce Campbell), he ends up unsuccessful. Later that day, the ants are attacked by wasps. Lucas finds a discarded firecracker and uses it to destroy the attacker wasp and scare the other ones away. This earns him the admiration of all the ants except for Zoc.

By nightfall, Lucas is introduced to honeydew and quickly becomes sick only to be cured by Hova. Together, they wander in the chamber of ages where he is shown a painting which depicts the Great Ant Mother and the evil Cloud-Breather (Stan Beals, the exterminator). Lucas is told that the Great Ant Mother will return and shower the ants with honeydew, while the Cloud-Breather will spell destruction for all of them. He and his friends go back to his house, where he tries to call Stan to cancel the contract but calls a pizza restaurant instead. Then his sister comes home and they are forced into hiding until dark, escaping in a drain. When Zoc finds out that Lucas put Hova in possible danger, he accuses him of further treachery and tells him that he should find another wizard because there is no way that he will give him the potion to turn him back to normal size again. He runs away, frightened, and Hova becomes angry with Zoc. But when he is eaten by a frog, Zoc frees him, starting to like him and realizing he was not so bad after all and becomes friends. Afterwards Zoc and Lucas discuss their differences. Zoc explains that ants work for the benefit of the colony. Lucas states that most humans work for personal gain. Zoc is confused as to how anything gets accomplished in Lucas world.

The next morning, Lucas finds the Great Ant Mother approaching. He discovers that it is actually a giant balloon strapped to the top of Stan Beals van used as a symbol for pest control. The ants enlist the aid of the wasps to stop Beals for aiding chaos. At first, they threatened Lucas, but hearing that their nest is destroyed by Stan, they agree to help. During the battle with Stan, Lucas saves the lives of Hova and an injured wasp. Both the ants and wasps were no match against pesticide, but as Stan is about to exterminate the ant hill, a beetle and glowworm manage to bite him in the crotch. Lucas injects him with a shrinking potion, misshaping him and forcing him to escape using a tricycle pursued by wasps.  The group returns to the colony victorious, where Lucas is hailed as a hero for his brave actions. Zoc, having understood who Lucas is, gives him the enlarging potion where he returns to his normal size. His parents return from their trip and reunites with Lucas. He managed to beat the bigger bully by getting the other Kronies to join him and be "bigger" than the bully, while his former ones become his friends. The film ends with him giving a bag of jelly beans to the ant colony much to their happiness.

==Production==
Hanks originally conceived the idea for an animated film adaptation after reading the book with his child. He then sent a copy of the book to Davis because of Davis work on the computer-animated film  .  Davis came up with a potential take on the story within a few days. "To be honest, when I first looked at it, I thought Oh, why does it have to be ants again?" said Davis. "But the more I thought about it, I said, So what? Its got as much to do with The Incredible Shrinking Man as it does the other bug movies. Its a completely different story."  Also, Hanks agreed that the story could be expanded considerably (the original book being around only 2,000 words). Alcorn had a similar initial reaction to the project as Davis did. "My first thought," recalled Alcorn, "was, not another ant movie. But looking at the actual story, this was really about a little boy and how he learns about the world by having to live beneath the surface."  Davis states that he felt like something of a hypocrite when, while he was working on the script, carpenter ants infested his house and he called an exterminator.

Along with the theatrical release of The Ant Bully, there was an IMAX 3D version presented in only some of the IMAX theaters. The others continued to run the 3D version of Superman Returns. The special IMAX 3D version was remastered in 3D with IMAX DMR. Critics within the 3D motion picture community have given the film high marks, as unlike Superman Returns, the entire film is projected in 3D stereo. The process to turn a pure animation film into 3D is much simpler than converting a film having live actors.

Some of the production took place at C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures in Canada.

==Reception==

===Critical response=== Minneapolis Star Daily News was positive about the films lack of pop culture references and thought that the film does not "talk down" to children. Additionally, he noted that "adults may be amused (or maybe not) by the Christian parallel in the ants religion." 

===Box office===
The Ant Bully opened at #5 on July 28, 2006 and closed on November 16, 2006, with $28 million in North America and a total of $55 million worldwide. The estimated production budget was $50 million.
