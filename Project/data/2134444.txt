==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film was first release, film critic Bosley Crowther caustically panned the film, writing, "The most disturbing and depressing of the many depressing things about the Strands current Warner Brothers shocker, Highway 301, is the fact that governors in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina endorse this cheap gangster melodrama as an effective deterrent to crime. In forewords which are personally delivered by Marylands Lame duck (politics)|lame-duck Governor Lane and by Virginias and North Carolinas Governors Battle and Scott, respectively, these eminent and honorable officials convey the solemn idea that what you are about to see is something that will prove to you how profitless crime is ... However, the whole thing, concocted and directed by Andrew Stone, is a straight exercise in low Sadomasochism|sadism. And the reactions at the Strand yesterday among the early audience, made up mainly of muscular youths, might have shocked and considerably embarrassed the governors mentioned above." 

Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a positive review, writing, "Andrew Stone (Julie (1956 film)|Julie/Cry Terror!/The Steel Trap) effectively directs this enjoyable action-filled B film crime drama that wants us to know that crime doesnt pay."
