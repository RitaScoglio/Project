  Ben Hur.

In 1997, Ben-Hur was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

==Plot==
Judah Ben-Hur|Ben-Hur is a wealthy Jew and boyhood friend of the powerful Roman Tribune, Messala (character)|Messala. When an accident leads to Ben-Hurs arrest, Messala, who has become corrupt and arrogant, makes sure Ben-Hur and his family are jailed and separated.
 Quintus Arrius, who allows him to remain unchained. This actually works in the Admirals favor because when his ship is attacked and sunk by pirates, Ben-Hur saves him from drowning.

Arrius then treats Ben-Hur as a son, and over the years the young man grows strong and becomes a victorious chariot racer. This eventually leads to a climactic showdown with Messala in a chariot race, in which Ben-Hur is the victor. However, Messala does not die, as he does in the more famous 1959 remake of the film.

Ben-Hur is eventually reunited with his mother and sister, who are suffering from leprosy but are miraculously cured by Jesus.

==Production==
Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ had been a great success as a novel, and was adapted into a stage play which ran for twenty-five years. In 1922, two years after the plays last tour, the Goldwyn company purchased the film rights to Ben-Hur. The plays producer, Abraham Erlanger, put a heavy price on the screen rights. Erlanger was persuaded to accept a generous profit participation deal and total approval over every detail of the production.

Shooting began in Rome, Italy in October 1923 under the direction of Charles Brabin who was replaced shortly after filming began. Additional recastings (including Ramón Novarro as Ben-Hur) and a change of director caused the productions budget to skyrocket. After two years of difficulties and accidents, the production was eventually moved back to Los Angeles and production resumed in the spring of 1925. B. Reeves Eason and Christy Cabanne directed the second unit footage.   

Costs eventually rose to $3.9 million,  making Ben-Hur the most expensive film of the silent era. 

A total of 60,960 m (200,000&nbsp;ft) of film was shot for the chariot race scene, which was eventually edited down to 229&nbsp;m (750&nbsp;ft). {{cite book

Some scenes in the film were in two-color Technicolor, most notably the sequences involving Jesus. One of the assistant directors for this sequence was a very young William Wyler, who would direct the 1959 remake. The black-and-white footage was color tinted and toned in the films original release print. 

==Reception==
The studios publicity department was relentless in promoting the film, advertising it with lines like: "The Picture Every Christian Ought to See!" and "The Supreme Motion Picture Masterpiece of All Time". Although audiences flocked to Ben-Hur after its premiere in 1925 and the picture grossed $9 million worldwide, its huge expenses and the deal with Erlanger made it a net financial loss for MGM. It recorded an overall loss of $698,000. 

In terms of publicity and prestige however, it was a great success. It helped establish the new MGM as a major studio. {{cite news url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100110 title = The Making and Release of Ben-Hur publisher = findarticles.com accessdate = 2007-01-26

The film was re-released in 1931 with an added musical score, by the original composers William Axt and David Mendoza, and sound effects. As the decades passed, the original two-color Technicolor segments were replaced by alternate black-and-white takes. Ben-Hur earned $1,352,000 during its re-release and made a profit of $779,000 meaning it had an overall profit of $81,000.  It remains one of the few films at Rotten Tomatoes to maintain a 100% freshness rating. 

==Restoration== Czech film stereo orchestral soundtrack by Carl Davis with the London Philharmonic Orchestra which was originally recorded for a Thames Television screening of the movie.

==DVD release== 1959 version starring Charlton Heston, as well as in the 2011 "Fiftieth Anniversary Edition" Blu-ray Collectors Edition three-disc box set.
