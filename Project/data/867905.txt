==Production Notes==
  and was a precursor to the buddy cop film genre.]]
Kurosawa mentioned in several interviews that his script was inspired by Jules Dassin’s The Naked City and the works of Georges Simenon.  Kurosawa wrote the script with Ryūzō Kikushima, a writer who had never written a script before.

During the opening credits, there is footage of a panting dog. However, when American censors saw the footage, they assumed that the dog had been harmed. This run-in with American censors caused Kurosawa to remark that this was the only time he wished Japan had not lost WWII.    The film released in the U.S in 1963.

Despite being one of Akira Kurosawas most critically renowned postwar films, Nora Inu was once not held in such high regard by the director himself. Kurosawa has been quoted as saying that he thinks little of the film, calling it “too technical” while also remarking that it contains “all that technique and not one real thought in it.” His attitude had changed by 1982, when he wrote in his autobiography that “no shooting ever went as smoothly,” and that “the excellent pace of the shooting and the good feeling of the crew can be sensed in the finished film.”  

==Remake== Nora Inu, starring Tetsuya Watari as Murakami and Shinsuke Ashida as Satō. The location was changed from Tokyo to Okinawa. 　It was remade for television in 2013.
