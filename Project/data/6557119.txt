== Plot == Underworld and caused chaos in Egypt. With Ras blessing, Tutankhamun manages to overcome Set and keep the demon under control by breaking an emerald tablet into four pieces and sending the pieces to the far corners of the world. However, the tradeoff is that he must remain in the Underworld.

In 1922, Danny Freemont, an Archaeology|archaeologist, is searching for the last piece of the tablet, which is believed to be in Tutankhamuns tomb. He found the first three pieces earlier, but they were seized from him by his rival, Morgan Sinclair. Sinclair is in the service of the Hellfire Council, a secret committee formed by a group of influential men from around the world, and they wish to use the tablets powers to achieve their goal of world domination. Sinclair uses the Hellfire Councils influence to damage Freemonts reputation and cause him to lose his job.
 Egyptologist named Azelia Barakat, to join him in his quest to find Tutankhamuns tomb and the last piece of the tablet. Despite their efforts, the last piece still falls into the hands of Sinclair and the Hellfire Council. Sinclair assembles all four pieces in the tomb, absorbs the tablets powers, and unleashes Set and the demons of the Underworld. He also gets rid of the Hellfire Councils members later.

Freemont and his companions manage to hold off Sinclair and other enemies and make their way back to the tomb, where they open a portal to the Underworld. In the Underworld, Freemont and his friends succeed in finding and freeing Tutankhamun, but the boy pharaoh is too weak to help them. Meanwhile, Sinclair is absorbed by Set, who then attacks Freemont. At the critical moment, Barakat prays to Ra to empower Tutankhamun and her wish is granted. Tutankhamun springs to life, fights Set, and brings Freemont and Barakat (the only two survivors) safely out of the Underworld. Before leaving, Tutankhamun thanks them and tells them that "all things are as they should have been". Freemont and Barakat do not understand what he means and they leave the tomb just before it closes by itself.
