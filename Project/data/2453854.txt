 animated cartoon Leon Schlesinger Productions, and released to theatres on August 8, 1936 by Warner Bros. Pictures and The Vitaphone Corporation. The plot follows the misadventures of a black man in the stereotypical minstrel show and coon song mold. He sneaks out of church and soon finds himself in hell, where he learns the error of his ways, and when he wakes up again in the living world, he makes haste to the church. The shorts stereotypical portrayal of black characters prompted United Artists to withhold it from distribution in 1968, making it one of the infamous Censored Eleven.

==Summary==
Ringing bells in a lazy town announce that it is time to go to church. A black preacher with caricatured enormous lips greets his parishioners as he sings the song for which the short is named. A   and old uncle shine the heads of pickanniny children; a woman takes a bra off a clothesline to use as a bonnet for her twin children. Lindvall notes that mammies were "ubiquitous in films dealing with black culture". Lindvall 128. 

Freleng introduces the cartoons protagonist, Nicodemus, when Mammy Two-Shoes finds him playing dice. She exclaims, "You good for nothing! Get yourself to that church. The Devils gonna get you sure as youre born!" and drags him off by the ear. Nevertheless, Nicodemus slinks out the door, opting to steal some chickens instead. Unfortunately, a knock on the head sends him to the "Hades Court of Justice", where a demon reviews his crimes and sends him deeper into hell. Big-lipped demons carry him to the Devil himself, who sings to Nicodemus that "youve got to give the Devil his due." The boss orders some demons to "give em the works," but Nicodemus wakes to find the prods of pitchforks are nothing but the pecks of chickens in the land of the living. He hears the church bells and makes haste to the meeting house.

==Distribution==
Warner Bros. released Sunday Go to Meetin Time in American theaters on August 8, 1936. Since 1968, the cartoon has been withheld from distribution. At that time, United Artists owned the rights to color Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons before August 1948. Sunday Go to Meetin Time and ten other cartoons were deemed to feature racist depictions of African Americans, making them too integral to the films for simple cuts to make them palatable for modern audiences. These eleven cartoons make up the so-called Censored Eleven.  However, it was announced in October 2010 that all Censored Eleven cartoons, including this one, will finally be available for release on DVD in 2011 on the Warner Archives collection of DVD sets. .
