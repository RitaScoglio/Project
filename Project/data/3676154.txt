Emma Harts early life as the mistress of the charming but unreliable  

Greville gives Emma to Sir William in exchange for relief on his debts. At first Emma is crushed by this turn of events. Gradually, however, she comes to appreciate her luxurious surroundings and her glamorous new life. She also grows to respect Sir William, who marries her and explains the reasons for Britains war against Napoleon. When Horatio Nelson (Laurence Olivier) arrives in Naples, Emma is soon deeply attracted to him and is impressed by his passionate insistence on resisting Napoleons dictatorial rule. She leaves Sir William to live with Nelson, who is also married. Their idyllic life together is threatened by the continuing war and their infidelity to their spouses.  Nelson leaves to confront Napoleons navy in the decisive Battle of Trafalgar. After his death in the battle, she succumbs to alcoholism and spirals down into poverty and oblivion.

==Production==
  Pearl Harbor Vincent designed Sir William Hamiltons palatial home that looked out over the sea of Naples, as well as the interiors of Merton Place: the home Emma and Nelson shared when they returned to England. On a tight budget, Korda completed filming in only five weeks, working from an original screenplay by Walter Reisch and R.C. Sherriff. Originally intended to be named The Enchantress, the film was first released in Britain as Lady Hamilton. 
 Admiral Hood; Olivier would play Admiral Hood 43 years later in The Bounty (1984).

Because of the strict Motion Picture Production Code, the two lovers never appear in bed together, nor ever even partially undressed together. Before the affair begins, Emma sits on her bed, wherein Nelson is recovering from exhaustion, to feed him some soup. According to K.R.M. Shorts study of the film, the major problem for the Production Code office was not the scenes showing romantic encounters:  It was the scripts treating an "adulterous relationship as a romance instead of a sin"  

The supporting cast of That Hamilton Woman includes Sara Allgood as Emmas mother, Gladys Cooper as Lady Nelson, and Alan Mowbray as William Hamilton, Emmas husband, the British ambassador to Naples and collector of objets dart.

::"Gentlemen, you will never make peace with Napoleon…Napoleon cannot be master of the world until he has smashed us up, and believe me, gentlemen, he means to be master of the world! You cannot make peace with dictators. You have to destroy them–wipe  them out!"

==Reception== love story would have had more poignancy. As it is, the little drama in the picture is dissipated over many expansive scenes; compassion is lost in marble halls."  Of the two stars, Crowther said, "Vivien Leighs entire performance as Lady Hamilton is delightful to behold. All of the charm and grace and spirit which Miss Leigh contains is beautifully put to use to capture the subtle spell which Emma most assuredly must have weaved. Laurence Oliviers Nelson is more studied and obviously contrived, and his appearance is very impressive, with the famous dead eye and empty sleeve." 

Critical sources usually point out that That Hamilton Woman was Winston Churchills favorite film.   In her research on the subject, film historian Professor Stacey Olster reveals that at the time the film was made, Alexander Korda’s New York offices were “supplying cover to MI-5 agents gathering intelligence on both German activities in the United States and isolationist sentiments among makers of American foreign policy.” Olster, Stacey. "Remakes, Outtakes, and Updates in Susan Sontag’s The Volcano Lover." Modern Fiction Studies, Vol. 41, no. 1, 1995, pp. 122–123.  According to Anthony Holden, Olivier’s biographer, That Hamilton Woman “became Exhibit A in a case brought against Korda by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Committee had accused him of operating an espionage and propaganda center for Britain in the United States—a charge Korda only escaped by virtue of the fact that his scheduled appearance before the committee on December 12, 1941 was preempted by the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor five days earlier".
