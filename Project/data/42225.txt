==Music==
The film takes classic songs and fits them into an updated scenario, and in some cases with unexpected dance routines. The choreography is lively and the actors and actresses do not look like professional dancers, which makes the music and dance more natural.

==Reception==
The film was well received. As of September 2011, it enjoys a 79% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Janet Maslin wrote a strongly positive review in the New York Times, describing the film as "a delightful and witty compendium of the film makers favorite things." 

Among the films strongest detractors was Jonathan Rosenbaum, who described it as "creepy" and claimed "this characterless world of Manhattan-Venice-Paris, where love consists only of self-validation, and political convictions of any kind are attributable to either hypocrisy or a brain condition, the me-first nihilism of Allens frightened worldview is finally given full exposure, and its a grisly thing to behold."

===Songs heard in the film===
*Most of the performers sing in their own voices, with two exceptions: Goldie Hawn, who was told by Allen to intentionally sing worse because she sang too well to be believable as a normal person just breaking into song, and Drew Barrymore, who convinced Woody Allen that her singing was too awful even for the "realistic singing voice" concept he was going for. Her voice was dubbed by Allen regular Olivia Hayman.
 Animal Crackers Hooray for French by a chorus of Groucho Marxes.
