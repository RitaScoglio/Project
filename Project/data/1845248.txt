==Plot summary== campaign of 1776.
 Hessian garrison Trenton The logistics make the plan appear all but impossible to Colonel John Glover, but due to his loyalty to Washington, he agrees to take the army across. Proposing this operation to his staff, General Gates scoffs at its possibility, going over the line by calling Washington insane and unfit for command. Furious, Washington dismisses Gates from the camp at gunpoint, ordering him into silence. The rest of the staff laughs, but Washington and Glover silence them with the lack of advantages they have. On Christmas night, the Hessians will be feasting and drinking, so the morning after, hopefully still in darkness, the Continentals must take the fight to them while sluggish and hung over. The officers have only a few days to select their brigades and weapons, and the soldiers, until it is time to cross, must be told no more than necessary. 

Despite their own fatigue and the winter weather, Washington manages to lift his weary soldiers spirits, allowing the army to cross the river on the night of December&nbsp;25â€“26, 1776. The crossing is done in one night, allowing the troops to attack Trenton at eight o clock on December 26, 1776, and gains a stunning victory, capturing almost all the Hessians to their own advantage.
