 Gone in 60 Seconds and The Junkman, as well as new material featuring Hoyt Axton.

== Plot == Gone in 60 Seconds, with the addition of the character of Gibbs.

== Cast ==
* H.B Toby Halicki – Maindrian Pace/Vicinski/Mr. Villis 
* Hoyt Axton – Captain Gibbs 
* Marion Busia – Pumpkin Chase 
* Jerry Daugirda – Eugene Chase 
* George Cole – Atlee Jackson 
* Lang Jeffries – Lt. Arthur 
* Dan Grimaldi – Carl Augusta
* Judi Gibbs – herself
* Pat Hartigan – Lt. Reed 

== Production == Gone in 60 Seconds. The film is essentially a trimmed alternate cut of his 1974 cult classic with a new subplot featuring Axton incorporated into it. The chase from The Junkman was depicted in that film as the making of a car chase picture – a case of meta-fiction; in Deadline Auto Theft, the footage is incorporated into the plot, essentially making this film the movie that was being produced in The Junkman.
