==Synopsis==
Hye-jins homecoming should have been a joyous occasion. She was especially happy to see her childhood friend again, the shy Eun-ju. However, when a secret is revealed, harsh words are exchanged. These words deeply affect Eun-ju and, in the next scene, we see her plummeting from a 30-story building. In a flashback provided by Sun-ae, we learn that the ghost of Eun-ju is hunting down all of Hye-jins friends and killing them. Is this possible or is a more worldly force at work? What is this mysterious tape that everyone is asking about?
