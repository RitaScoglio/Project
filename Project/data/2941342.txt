Flesh Gordon Meets the Cosmic Cheerleaders (aka Flesh Gordon 2: Flesh Gordon Meets the Cosmic Cheerleaders) is the 1989 sequel to the sex comedy Flesh Gordon.  Like the original, it spoofs the Flash Gordon serials, though the humor is more scatological than the original.

==Plot==
Flesh (Vince Murdocco) is kidnapped by cheerleaders from a world known only as The Strange Planet, after the men on their planet are rendered impotent thanks to the villain known only as the Evil Presence (William Dennis Hunt). The Evil Presence, who is in an unhappy relationship with Queen Frigid (Maureen Webb), soon learns of Fleshs arrival on the planet, and wishes to transfer Fleshs penis to himself, in order to make up for his own poor endowment.

==Reception==
This movie was rated NC-17 by the MPAA, due to its scatological humor. It is often cited as being one of the worst movies of all time.
