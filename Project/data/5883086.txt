}} musical film book of stage production of the same name by James Kirkwood, Jr. and Nicholas Dante. The songs were composed by Marvin Hamlisch and Edward Kleban. The film is called Chorus Line in the UK and several other countries.

==Plot== Broadway theatre theatre to musical production directed by Zach (Michael Douglas). After the initial eliminations, sixteen hopefuls remain. Arriving late is former lead dancer Cassie (Alyson Reed) who once had a tempestuous romantic relationship with Zach but left him to take a job in Hollywood. Now she hasnt worked in over a year, and is desperate enough for work to even just be part of the chorus line and audition for him; whether hes willing to let professionalism overcome his personal feelings about their past remains to be seen.

As the film unfolds, the backstory of each of the dancers is revealed. Some are funny, some ironic, some heartbreaking. No matter what their background, however, they all have one thing in common - a passion for dance.

==Production==
  British director would give the musicals quintessentially American story.
 Sir Richard Madonna auditioned Broadway for a dance role in his movie using her birth-name of Ciccone. He rejected her. 

The decision to tamper with the score disappointed fans of the show. "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love," "Sing!," and "The Music and the Mirror" were deleted and new songs "Surprise, Surprise" and "Let Me Dance For You" were added. The shows breakout tune, "What I Did for Love," originally was performed as a paean to dancers and their dedication to their craft, but in the film it becomes a wistful love song by Cassie about Zach as she leaves the stage.

The stage musical was one of the first to address the subject of homosexual actors within the theatre business, but some overt references to it were eliminated from the film.
 choreographed by Jeffrey Hornaday.

==Critical reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby observed, "Though it was generally agreed that Hair (film)|Hair would not work as a film, Miloš Forman transformed it into one of the most original pieces of musical cinema of the last 20 years. Then they said that A Chorus Line couldnt be done - and this time they were right . . . Mr. Attenborough has elected to make a more or less straightforward film version that is fatally halfhearted." 

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, "The result may not please purists who want a film record of what they saw on stage, but this is one of the most intelligent and compelling movie musicals in a long time - and the most grown up, since it isnt limited, as so many contemporary musicals are, to the celebration of the survival qualities of geriatric actresses." 

Variety (magazine)|Variety said, "Chorus often seems static and confined, rarely venturing beyond the immediate. Attenborough merely films the stage show as best he could. Nonetheless, the director and lenser Ronnie Taylor have done an excellent job working within the limitations, using every trick they could think of to keep the picture moving. More importantly, they have a fine cast, good music and a great, popular show to work with. So if all they did was get it on film, thats not so bad." 

Time Out London says, "The grit and drive of the original have been dissipated into studiously unkempt glitz as empty as plasticised pop . . . Its too corny and unbelievable for words." {{cite book title = last = first = year = publisher = Time Out location = isbn = page = url = accessdate = archiveurl = archivedate = December 20, 2010 }}
