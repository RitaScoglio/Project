==Plot== Pessimistic Richard fears everything. rotunda painted with famous literary characters. He slips on some water dripping from his coat and falls down, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into illustrations.

He is met by the Pagemaster, who sends him through the fiction section to find the librarys exit. Along the way, Richard befriends three  ), a swashbuckling pirate-like book; Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg), a sassy but caring fairy tale book; and Horror (Frank Welker), a fearful "Hunchbook" with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out. Together, the quartet encounter classic-fictional characters. They meet Dr. Jekyll (Leonard Nimoy) who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the groups separated after Moby Dick attacks. Richard and Adventure are picked up by the Hispaniola, captained by Long John Silver (Jim Cummings). The pirates go to Treasure Island, but find no treasure, nearly causing a mutiny. Fantasy and Horror return and defeat the pirates. Silver attempts taking Richard with him, but surrenders when Richard threatens him with a sword. Adventure insults Horror, causing the hunchbook to get captured by Lilliputians from Gullivers Travels. Adventure saves him and they make up.
 Captain Ahab, Long John Silver and the dragon reappear in a magical twister congratulating him. The Pagemaster then swoops Richard and the books into the twister, sending them back to the real world.

Richard awakens, finding Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror next to him as real books. Mr. Dewey finds him, and, even though the library policy only allows a person to check out two books at time, lets him check out all three books "just this once". When Richard leaves, Mr. Dewey gives a smile, hinting that Richards entire adventure was not a dream and that he is the Pagemaster; adding onto this possibility is that Richard was missing his jacket when he awoke. Richard returns home a braver kid, sleeping in his new treehouse. Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror appear as silhouettes on a wall. Adventure says a kiss would make the ending good, yelling in anger when Horror does so instead of Fantasy.

==Controversy== legal arbitration Writers Guild credits are Disney Television dating back to 1985, also written under WGA contract. These facts positioned the WGA to get involved, testing their tenuous authority over a feature film with animated elements.

After lengthy investigation and interviews with those intimately familiar with the genesis of the Pagemaster project, including three persons within Kirschners own office, the WGA credit arbitration process determined that David Casci was, in fact, the primary writer, and that Mr. Kirschner did not provide a sufficient creative contribution to the writing process to warrant any screenwriting credit. Upon receiving this determination by the WGA, Fox threatened to pull out of arbitration and release the film without WGA-approved credits, positioning the WGA to be forced to file an injunction blocking the films heavily promoted Christmas season release.

Ultimately, a settlement was reached, and Fox released the film with both Kirschner and Casci receiving story and screenplay credit, with a third writer, Ernie Contreras, also receiving screenplay credit.
 WGA on behalf of one of its members.

==Production notes== Dream Away", Babyface and Lisa Stansfield; the other, "Whatever You Imagine", sung by Wendy Moten.

Many of the cast members have had roles in the   played Captain  ,  ,  ,  , and   and  .  ".   on  .

Additionally both Nimoy and Welker voiced the character Galvatron in Transformers (with Nimoy voicing him in   and Welker voicing him in  ).

Promotional advertisements for this film used the theme from the 1984 film The Last Starfighter.

Cascis original screenplay included a story arc for the protagonist, Richard Tyler (played by Macaulay Culkin), who begins the tale as a boy who hates reading, but by the end of the film, learns to love reading. The revised screenplay by Contreras and Kirschner omitted the reading-themed story arc, instead emphasizing the boys journey from cowardice to courage.

According to the films animation crew, the film went over budget during animation production due to mismanagement and changes to the narrative.   The 2001 book Producing Animation by Catherine Winder and Zahra Dowlatbadi (Johnstons assistant on The Pagemaster) recommends against making story changes during the animation process.

Fantasy and Long John Silver are voiced by Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Cummings. Both had starred a role (along with Cheech Marin) in The Lion King, another animated film released the same year, as three troublesome hyenas.

As animation production began in August 1992, live-action scenes were filmed from September 21, to October 15, 1992. After two years in the making, the film was completed and wrapped in the summer of 1994. According to the copyright holder, it was believed to be made in 1993 (although the film was just released a year later).

==Extended and deleted scenes==
The Pagemaster is actually presented in an extended cut version. But during the production, the original scenes were removed: both live action and animation. They were meant to do so, because for some reason in animation; some scenes may frighten young children in the audience.
And so, the film was edited instead as better. Luckily, the deleted scenes and characters can be still seen during the making of the film, trailers and TV spots, SkyBox International trading cards, books and other related products. They can be also seen during the sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of Once Upon a Forest, the 1994 VHS release of Rookie of the Year, and in the promotional trailer of the VHS release of the film on the promotional demo/screener VHS copy in 1995.

==Reception and release== documentary was Fox Video; Columbia TriStar Richie Rich) Wyatt Earp.
 Variety said that the films principal appeal for adults would be its abbreviated running time, and that it did not do enough with its famous fictional characters, although he noted that, "A more inspired moment has Richard using a book, Jack and the Beanstalk, to escape from the belly of a dragon. Unfortunately, such moments are few and far between." 
Rita Kempley of The Washington Post, however, gave the film a positive review, calling it a "splendidly original childrens fantasy about the world of books."   James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave another positive review, calling it a "clever, often engaging, and always fast-paced motion picture" that "uses the visual medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination."

==Book adaptations==
Contrary to any claims, the screenplay and film are not based on any book. David Cascis screenplay preceded all novelizations and illustrated books by several years.

A number of books based on the film exist, including an illustrated book attributed to David Kirschner and Ernie Contreras, illustrated by Jerry Tiritilli, which contained large passages from the Casci screenplay without giving Casci writing credit. The film was well into production by the time this book was introduced in the 1993 F. A. O. Schwarz Christmas Catalog. Other properties based on the film include a novelization of the film, childrens story books, pop-up books and other film ancillaries such as toys and games.

In 1995, David Kirschners novel version of The Pagemaster won the Books I Love Best Yearly: Younger Readers Award in Australia (see bottom of page).
