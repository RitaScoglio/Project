==Plot==
The film begins with Bobby Carter and his psychiatrist discussing the events of The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)| the first film, which took place eight years ago. Bobby is still traumatized by those events, but he and Rachel (formerly known as Ruby) now own a biker team, and have also invented a super fuel that can power bikes. The team is due to race in the same desert where the original massacre took place, and Bobbys psychiatrist tries to convince him to go, but he decides against it, and Rachel takes his place. The team consisting of the blind Cass, her boyfriend Roy, Harry, Hulk, Foster, Jane and Sue meet up at a bus and set off. Along the way, they pick up Beast from the dog pound, the dog previously owned by the Carters, who now belongs to Rachel.

While going through the desert, they get lost and Harry suggests a shortcut through the bombing range. As they drive, the bus begins leaking fuel and they stop at an old mining ranch. As they explore the mine, Pluto, who has apparently survived the earlier attack from Beast, attacks Rachel. She fights him off and he retreats. No one believes her at first, until Pluto returns and steals one of their bikes. Roy and Harry chase him down, but Harry falls behind, gets caught in a trap and is flattened by a massive rock. Roy catches Pluto but is ambushed by a 7-foot cannibal called the Reaper who knocks him unconscious. The Reaper is later revealed to be Papa Jupiters older brother.

Meanwhile, the rest of the group stays at the mine until nightfall, and they begin to worry about Roy and Harry. Rachel and Hulk depart to look for them while the others stay behind. The Reaper then begins to stalk the remaining teens. First Hulk, who he shoots through the chest with a spear bolt, leaving Rachel to run away in fear. 

The Reaper then returns to the mine, where he pulls Foster under the bus and kills him with a hatchet. Jane finds Fosters body but the Reaper catches her and crushes her with a bearhug. Sue returns to the camp only to be thrown through a window by the Reaper, who then slits her throat with a machete. Rachel runs into Pluto, but Beast surprises him and chases him away. She then runs into the Reaper again, who pushes her causing her to hit her head on a rock, leaving only Cass.

Meanwhile, Roy wakes up and runs into Pluto at the top of a cliff. Pluto gets ready to attack Roy but Beast returns and knocks him off the cliff to his death.

Cass runs from the Reaper and ends up in his mineshaft where he dumped the bodies, and comes across the corpses of all her friends. She throws a jar of acid at his face and escapes up a rope with help from Roy. The Reaper follows them but they trap him in the bus where all the bike fuel is. They set it on fire and watch as it blows up. The Reaper escapes from the wreckage covered in flames and tries one more time to kill them but he stumbles into an open mineshaft, and falls to his death.

The film ends with Roy, Cass and Beast walking away from the mine at sunrise, into the vast desert as they follow the road home.
