== Plot ==

The films backstory is told in flashback, mimicking the style of the Arabian Nights.

Ahmad (John Justin), the naive King of Baghdad|Bagdad, is convinced by his evil Grand Vizier, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt), to go out into the city disguised as a poor man to get to know his subjects (in the manner of his grandfather Harun al-Rashid). Jaffar then has Ahmad thrown into a dungeon, where he is joined by the young thief Abu (Sabu Dastagir|Sabu), who arranges their escape. They flee to Basra, where Ahmad becomes acquainted with its Princess (June Duprez), who is so beautiful that no man can look upon her. However, Jaffar also journeys to Basra, for he desires the Princess. Her father, the Sultan (Miles Malleson), is fascinated by the magical mechanical flying horse Jaffar offers and agrees to the proposed marriage. Upon hearing the news, the Princess, by now deeply in love with Ahmad, runs away. Confronted by Ahmad, Jaffar magically blinds him and turns Abu into a dog; the spell can only be broken if Jaffar holds the Princess in his arms.

The Princess is eventually captured (but not recognised) and sold in the slave market. She is bought secretly by Jaffar and taken to his mansion, but falls into a deep sleep from which he cannot rouse her. Ahmad is tricked by Jaffars servant Halima (Mary Morris) into awakening the Princess. Halima then lures the Princess onto Jaffars ship by telling her that there is a doctor aboard who can cure Ahmads blindness. The ship immediately sets sail. Jaffar informs the Princess about the spell; she allows herself to be embraced, whereupon Ahmads sight is restored and Abu is returned to human form. They chase after the ship in a small boat, but Jaffar conjures up a storm to shipwreck them.
 Djinn or Rex Ingram) appears. Embittered by his long imprisonment, the genie informs Abu that he is going to kill his rescuer, but Abu tricks him back into the bottle. The genie then offers to grant Abu three wishes if he will let him out again. The hungry boy uses his first wish to ask for sausages. When Abu demands to know where Ahmad is, the genie flies Abu to the top of the highest mountain in the world. On it sits a temple, and in the temple there is an enormous statue with a large jewel, the All-Seeing Eye, set in its forehead. The genie tells Abu that the Eye will show him where to find Ahmad. Abu fights off a giant guardian spider while climbing the statue and steals the gem.

Jaffar refuses to magically bind the Princess to his will as he genuinely wants her to love him, but she both fears and hates him. The Princess pleads with Jaffar to return her to Basra, and he does so willingly. However, she implores her father not to force her into marrying Jaffar, and the Sultan promises he will not let Jaffar have her. Furious at the Sultan breaking his word, Jaffar presents him with another mechanical toy, a dancing statue of the many-armed "Silver Maid" (Mary Morris, in a dual role), and it stabs the Sultan to death.

The genie then takes Abu to Ahmad. When Ahmad asks to see the Princess, Abu has him gaze into the All-Seeing Eye. Ahmad despairs when he sees Jaffar arranging for the Princess to inhale the fragrance of the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness, which makes her forget her love. In agony, Ahmad lashes out at Abu for showing him the scene. During the ensuing argument, Abu unthinkingly wishes Ahmad to Bagdad. The genie, freed after granting the last wish, abandons Abu alone in the wilderness.

Ahmad appears in Jaffars castle and is quickly captured, but seeing him restores the Princesss memory. The furious usurper sentences them both to death. Abu, unable to watch his friends impending doom, shatters the All-Seeing Eye and as a result is transported to the "land of legend", where he is greeted by the Old King (Morton Selten) and thanked for freeing the inhabitants, who had been turned to stone. As a reward, he is given a magic crossbow and is named the kings successor. However, to save Ahmad, Abu steals the kings magic flying carpet and rushes to the rescue.

Abus marvellous aerial arrival in Bagdad (which fulfils a prophecy cited in the course of the story) sparks a revolt against Jaffar. Abu kills the fleeing Jaffar with his crossbow, shooting him in the forehead, and Ahmad regains his kingdom and his love. However, when Abu hears (with growing alarm) Ahmad telling the people of his plan to send him to school to train to become his new Grand Vizier, Abu instead flies away on the carpet to find his own fun and adventure.

==Reception==
The film was Kordas most successful in the US. 

New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther enthused that the film "ranks next to Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia as the most beguiling and wondrous film of this troubled season."    Crowther praised "its truly magnificent color"  and the performances of all five main actors.

Roger Ebert has rated The Thief of Bagdad among his great movies, "on a level with The Wizard of Oz."    According to Ebert, "it maintains a consistent spirit, and that spirit is one of headlong joy in storytelling."  He praised the performances of Sabu and Veidt ("perfectly pitched to the needs of the screenplay"), though he was less impressed with the chemistry between Duprez and Justin ("rather bloodless"). 

Unlike its 1924 predecessor, which holds a 95% fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes, the 1940 film has a 100% fresh rating. 

==Influence== earlier silent Richard Williams, speaking about his film The Thief and the Cobbler, said that one of his interests was in creating an Oriental fantasy that did not copy from it. The Prince of Persia video game franchise also shares similar characteristics with the film.
