}} thriller about stalker menacing Bob Randall, Razzie Award for Worst Original Song for "Hearts, Not Diamonds". 

This movie received a lot of attention because it was released a few months after the murder of John Lennon, who was shot to death by Mark David Chapman, a former fan, outside his apartment building The Dakota, a building which Lauren Bacall has long resided in. However, it was a critical and commercial failure.

The Fan was shot in New York City from March 31, 1980 to July 1980.

Douglas Breen (Michael Biehn) is a deranged young record salesman who is obsessed with glamorous stage and screen star Sally Ross (Lauren Bacall).
