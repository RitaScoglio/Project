==Plot==
  ]] Independence Day block party where Molly Carr, from Yorkville, Manhattan, falls in love with him. Comic relief is provided by grocer Eric Swenson (El Brendel), above whose shop Molly and her flatmate, Bea Nichols (Marjorie White), live.  The Times, December 30, 1929, New Gallery Cinema "Sunny Side Up"  Gaynor performs a charming singing and dancing version of the song "(Keep Your) Sunny Side Up" for a crowd of her neighbors, complete with top hat and cane.  Later in the film, a lavish pre-Code dance sequence for the song "Turn on the Heat," including scantily clad and gyrating island women enticing bananas on trees to abruptly grow and stiffen, with the graphic metaphor lost on no one, occurs without Gaynors participation.

==Reception==
The Times and The New York Times both express the opinion that the film, and the singing voices of Gaynor and Farrell, are all tolerable if not exactly worthy of praise. Despite the sugary sentimentality, the film is engaging, while the cinematography and special effects are impressive.  

Footage from Sunny Side Up was included in the comedy film It Came from Hollywood, which parodied
B movies. 

==Music==

===Im A Dreamer, Arent We All?===
Several times throughout the film Gaynor sings the tune "Im a Dreamer, Arent We All?" and, on one occasion, sings it impressively, according to the  .
 Animal Crackers Chico starts up with "Im a dreamer, Montreal."  The pun has been much-recycled   not least in Stewart Parkers award-winning play Iâ€™m a Dreamer, Montreal.

The tune was recorded by John Coltrane in 1958   and included on his album Bahia (album)|Bahia (1964).
