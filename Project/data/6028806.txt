==Plot==
Judith Singer is a former Newsday reporter who misses her old life, now that her husband Bob spends most of his time at work and her time at home on Long Island has become a bore.

When her dentist, Dr. Bruce Fleckstein, is found murdered, Judith sees the possibility of a story that she might be able to sell to the newspapers editor, maybe even get her old job back. Judith might have been the last person to see Fleckstein alive, which makes detective David Suarez consider her both a possible witness and a suspect.

The film is reviewed, favorably, in Pauline Kaels ninth collection of movie reviews Hooked (book)|Hooked. She is especially complimentary about Susan Sarandons performance. "The screenplay provides a batch of actresses with a chance to show some comic verve. Susan Sarandons smile has never been more incredibly lush, and she does some inspired double takes - just letting her beautiful dark eyes pop."  "Its fun to have a movie about a woman whose curiosity is her salvation."
