}} American comedy Steven Weber, Craig Bierko, Viola Harris, Karen Sillas, Robyn Peterman and Matt Keeslar. The film was released on April 17, 1998, by Columbia Pictures.

==Plot== Atlantic City, so he asks cousin Evan for two more coins for one more spin â€” a spin that wins a $400,000 jackpot.

The joy of victory is quickly replaced by a fierce disagreement over who deserves what. Richie begins by offering Evan a very small percentage of his winnings. Evan didnt expect anything at first but now he is offended because he provided two-thirds of the money Richie sank into the machine.

A bitter feud develops. Richie, a sneaker designer, hogs all the money and quits his job. Evan, a doctor, is so annoyed that, as a prank, he lets Richie believe he is dying. By the time he reveals the joke, Richie has done something drastic.

The more rattled Evan gets, the more distracted he becomes at work. And even when the cousins come to a tentative truce, everything backfires on them in events that involve girlfriends, relatives and even the homeless.

==Reception==

The film gained poor reviews from critics.  The film made it on the 2005 list of Roger Eberts most hated films. In his review, he remarked "I cant easily remember a film Ive enjoyed less." 

Larry David himself has expressed regrets over the film. A poster for the film was put up on the set of Davids office for the filming of Curb Your Enthusiasms pilot episode. David had the poster promptly removed because he got "sick of looking at it" after one show.  In a later episode, Davids character tells his wife to stop lending people the film, and says he doesnt believe a friend who claimed to have enjoyed the movie, stating she was just trying to be polite.
