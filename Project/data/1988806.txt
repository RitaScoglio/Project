In 1947, Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons), a European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith), largely because he sees her adolescent daughter Dolores (Dominique Swain), also called "Lo", while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of this age (whom he calls "nymphets"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and marries Charlotte just to be near her.
 motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job. However, Los increasing boredom with Humbert, as well as her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension between them. Humberts desperate affections for Lo are also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty (Frank Langella), who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of their travels. Lo eventually runs off with Quilty, whose name Humbert doesnt know, and he searches for them unsuccessfully.

Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography.

===History of the screenplay===
The first screen adaptation of Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita (1962) was written by Nabokov and directed (after revisions) by Stanley Kubrick.
 Remains of James Ivory–Ismail Merchant partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits"; Hudgins adds: "We did not see Pinters name up in lights when Lynes Lolita finally made its appearance in 1998. Pinter goes on in the March 13   letter   to state that I have never been given any reason at all as to why the film company brought in another writer, again quite similar to the equally ungracious treatment that he received in the Remains of the Day situation. He concludes that though he never met Nabokov, indeed I knew "Lolita" very well and loved it.&nbsp;" (125). Hudgins also observes that Schiff was brought in after the efforts by Dearden (October 21, 1991), Pinter (September 26, 1994), and Mamet (March 10, 1995) and that Schiff "has no previous scripts to his credit" (124).  

According to Schiff, "Right from the beginning, it was clear to all of us that this movie was not a remake of Kubricks film. Rather, we were out to make a new adaptation of a very great novel." Schiff stated that "Some of the filmmakers involved actually looked upon the Kubrick version as a kind of what not to do" and quipped that Kubricks film should have been called Quilty, due to the prominent role of that character.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed to positive reviews, with an approval rating of 67% at Rotten Tomatoes and an average score of 46/100 at Metacritic.     Many critics evaluated the film highly and appreciated aspects of it, though some tended to qualify their positive comments. For example, James Berardinelli praised the performances of the two leads, Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain, but he considered Melanie Griffiths performance weak, "stiff and unconvincing"; he considered the film better when she no longer appeared in it and concluded: "Lolita is not a sex film; its about characters, relationships, and the consequences of imprudent actions. And those who seek to brand the picture as immoral have missed the point. Both Humbert and Lolita are eventually destroyed—what could be more moral? The only real controversy I can see surrounding this film is why there was ever a controversy in the first place." 

The film was The New York Times "Critics Pick" on 31 July 1998, with its critic Caryn James championing it and saying, "Rich beyond what anyone could have expected, the film repays repeated viewings...it turns Humberts madness into art."   

Writer and director James Toback lists it in his picks for the 10 finest films ever made, but he rates the original film higher.    

Commenting on differences between the novel and the film, Charles Taylor observes that " or all of their vaunted (and, it turns out, false) fidelity to Nabokov, Lyne and Schiff have made a pretty, gauzy Lolita that replaces the books cruelty and comedy with manufactured lyricism and mopey romanticism".    Extending Taylors observation, Keith Phipps concludes: "Lyne doesnt seem to get the novel, failing to incorporate any of Nabokovs black comedy—which is to say, Lolitas heart and soul."
