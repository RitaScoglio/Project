==Plot: primary change from novel==
The film, like the original novel, portrays the Anglo-Indian protagonist, Victoria Jones, as tugged in different directions by three suitors, Col. Rodney Savage, Ranjit Kasel and Patrick Taylor, each representing a different ethnic community: British, Indian (Sikh) and Anglo-Indian, respectively.  The film-makers, however, changed the novels ending and Victorias fate.  Whereas in the novel Victoria finally seeks her future with her fellow Anglo-Indian Patrick, a railway worker, the film-makers instead matched her at the end with the more obviously dashing British officer Rodney Savage, while consigning Patrick to a heroic death.   

==Production notes==
 
 Junction was in India, most probably Jhansi.  MGM had wanted to shoot the film in location in India; but, as the Government of India insisted on script approval and imposed high taxes,  MGM  decided to shoot the film in Pakistan where the Government was more welcoming. 

As a result of the change in Location to Pakistan, the script was altered to show   Rodney Savage  in command of  the 1/13 Frontier Force Battalion (55th Cokes Rifles (Frontier Force)|Cokes Rifles), which at that time of filming was part of the 7th (Golden Arrow) Division of the Pakistan Army, rather than in command of a  Gurkha Battalion, the  1/13 Gorkha Rifles, as in the book.  Pakistan army and police  enthusiastically assisted   in making of the film.  Several Pakistan  army units of 7 Golden Arrow division including the 5th Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 10 Frontier Force Regiment),  5th Probyn’s Horse,  First Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 7 Frontier Force Regiment), participated in the making of the film. Colonel Savage  in the film is shown wearing Golden Arrow the formation sign of  Pakistan 7 Division. 

Also in the movie is the 4th Battalion (Wildes) 13th Frontier Force Rifles, the band at the Lahore Railway Station with a deer as its mascot, while the troops taking part in the train accident were from the 4/13th. The battalion has a copy of the book and autographed photographs from both Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger.

The future Pakistani film star Neelo appeared in a small role as a reporter in a crowd scene. Neelo was introduced to Cukor by A. H. Rana, the films Production Manager and Casting Assistant in Pakistan, who worked with the films Casting Director, Harvey Woods. This was her first role in a movie.

==Reception==
The film earned $2,075,000 in North America and $2.8 million elsewhere, making a loss of $933,000. 

It recorded admissions of 1,554,970 in France.   at Box Office Story
