 MGM musical novel of Fred Harveys Harvey House Kenny Baker, Marjorie Main  and Chill Wills. Future star Cyd Charisse appears in her first film speaking role on film.
 On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe", written by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer.  The film was a product of the Arthur Freed unit at MGM.

==Plot== Fred Harveys Harvey House restaurants, travels on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF) to the western fictional town of Sandrock, apparently somewhere in Arizona. On the trip they meet Susan Bradley (Judy Garland), who travels to the same town to marry the man whose beautiful letters she received when she answered a "lonely-hearts" ad. Unfortunately, when she arrives, the man turns out to be an "old coot" who does not at all meet her expectations – and he also wants not to get married as much as she wants not to marry him, so they agree to call it off. When she learns that someone else, the owner of the local saloon, Ned Trent (John Hodiak), wrote the letters as a joke, she confronts him and tells him off, in the process endearing herself to him.

Then Susan joins the Harvey Girls, and she soon becomes their leader in fighting against the attempts by Trents business associate, Judge Sam Purvis (Preston Foster), to scare them off – and against the animosity of the dance-hall girls and, apparently, prostitutes, led by Em (Angela Lansbury), who is in love with Trent, and who sees Susan as a rival. Trent visits to see the value of the Harvey House and other trappings of civilization, then he tells Purvis to leave them alone, but Purvis continues with his campaign of intimidation, finally burning down the restaurant. Trent offers his saloon as a replacement, and Em and the dance-hall girls leave town. Susan, thinking that Trent too is leaving, gets on the train, but Em, seeing that Susan loves Trent so much that she is willing to give up everything for him, stops the train and points out Trent, riding toward them on his horse. The film ends with their wedding in the desert, surrounded by the Harvey Girls.

Although Angela Lansbury was a fine singer, her voice was considered unsuitable for her character, a low-class saloon singer. Virginia Rees provided Lansburys singing voice. Cyd Charisse, who had her first speaking role in the film, also had her singing dubbed by Marion Doenges. 

Virginia OBrien, a comic actress known for her deadpan style of singing, was pregnant while The Harvey Girls was filmed. Several scenes with Ray Bolger were never filmed due to the difficulty in hiding her pregnancy. This accounts for OBriens character disappearing after OBrien sings "Wild Wild West".  Bolger also sustained a burn injury by steam during the filming of "On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe". 

The Harvey Girls was released in the U.S. on January 18, 1946.

Mercers version entered the Billboard charts on July 5, 1945, and stayed on it for 16 weeks, including seven straight weeks as #1 between July 28 and September 8.

Cut from the film were three other songs written for it by Warren and Mercer: "March of the Doagies," "Hayride" and "My Intuition."  "Doagies" was a production number featuring Garland, and "My Intuition" was a duet for Garland and John Hodiak. Both of those number were filmed, while "Hayride", a duet for Garland and Ray Bolger was prerecorded but not filmed.

==Critical response==
Howard Barnes wrote in the New York Herald Tribune about the film: "A great big animated picture postcard. Judy Garland is the films bright ... star. Miss Garland is effectively glamorized in get-ups of the (18)90s and sings her songs pleasantly. The Harvey Girls is a perfect demonstration of what Hollywood can do with its vast resources when it wants to be really showy ... pretty girls – period sets and costumes – lilting tunes – super-speedy dance shuffles."

The  ." While   but she still appears to be having a pretty fine time." 

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $4,112,000 in the US and Canada and $1,063,000. 

==Awards and honors==
