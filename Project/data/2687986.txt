==Plot==
Little Fish is about Tracy Heart (Cate Blanchett), a former heroin addict who is desperately trying to escape her past and achieve her goals and dreams. Tracy lives with her mother (Noni Hazlehurst) and brother in the Little Saigon area (Cabramatta, New South Wales|Cabramatta) in Sydney, Australia, where heroin is readily available.

She is in need of money to become a partner in the video store that she works in, but her loan applications are repeatedly rejected by finance providers, as a result of her past criminal record, poor repayments of credit card debt, history of drug use and lack of collateral.  Tracy lies to both her mother and her boss at the video store, pretending she has received the loan.  This is one of the recurring themes of the movie, the casual ways people lie to each other for convenience.
 drug addicted stepfather and former NRL star Lionel (Hugo Weaving) to kick his heroin addiction.
After a four year absence in Vancouver, her former boyfriend Jonny Nguyen (Dustin Nguyen), also a former heroin addict, has come back into her life. Jonny, who now dresses in business suits, claims to have employment as a stockbroker at a large firm and suggests he may be able to obtain the money
Tracy desires through share trading. The romance between Tracy and Jonny is rekindled.

Upon visiting Jonnys alleged workplace, Tracy discovers Jonny has lied to her and is not in fact employed as a stockbroker. Jonny has become involved in a drug deal with her brother Ray, and Tracy also chooses to become involved in the deal as she sees this as the only means of providing the finance she needs to become a partner in the video store.
