==Synopsis==

Raymond Mak is a talented and brilliant investment consultant working on Hong Kong island, and this talent has provided Raymond with an abundant lifestyle. However, it cultivated an arrogant and heartless  . He is accosted during one morning rush by a young businessman in dire distress. The young man had been robbed, and has no means to cross Hong Kong harbour, back to the mainland at Kowloon. He pleads for HK$20 for MTR fair, as presumably his Octopus card was in his wallet.

Raymond ignores the young man coldly, and continues on his way to the office, where he finds out to the glee of his manager and co-workers that he had been fired, the previous night, for embezzlement and costing to much upkeep for the company. Raymond, in typical sociopathic manner, demands an explanation and cites his hard work, and even goes so far to claim that he was wronged, true to his warped sense of reasoning. The Boss, explodes in a tirade of buried trauma after years of Raymond abusing him and his co-workers in a tyrannical manner, "Everbody, even the cleaner all fear you!".

Being terminated at his job does not phase the arrogant Raymond, as he dramatically makes a phone call to a rival investment company across the harbour in Kowloon, whose boss has been trying for years to convince Raymond to defect. "This book of 10 years worth of contacts is now your enemy", he taunts one of his co-workers, as he leaves. Mr Logan, the rival, however urges Raymond to hurry and cross over to Kowloon, by 5 oclock as he has to fly to New York. Mak assures Mr. Logan that he will be there in 1 hour; however he is robbed in an alley. He needs HK$20 to cross the harbour to Kowloon....
