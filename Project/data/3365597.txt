Mickeys Trailer is a   makes a cameo in this cartoon where he is seen driving a truck during the "Runaway Trailer" sequence featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.

==Plot==
The movie starts at what seems like a small house in a natural setting. Mickey walks out the door and says, "Oh boy! What a day!" Then, he pulls a lever and walks inside. The house is converted into a trailer (with the natural setting in the shape of a giant hand fan revealed to be a city dump) and Goofys car is released from the side. Then, Goofy starts driving through the countryside while Mickey makes breakfast (corn on the cob, baked potatoes, watermelon, coffee, and milk). Meanwhile, Donald cant wake up, even when his alarm clock rings and pulls off his blanket. Thanks to a secret controlboard, Mickey manages to rouse him for a machine-assisted bath, but he saw birds and tried to swat them with the towel. Later, the bath is converted into a dining area.

When Mickey rings the dinner bell, Goofy foolishly leaves the drivers seat - while the car and trailer are still in motion and without stopping - for breakfast, in which it drives through a closed road. After several mishaps during the meal, eventually having popcorn for breakfast, Goofy notices that no one is in the drivers seat and accidentally and unknowingly unhitches the trailer in his panic to resume driving and goes on his way. The trailer rolls downhill on an epic runaway adventure, nearly crashing into a truck and two trains and is a wreck on the inside (but okay on the outside) by the time its miraculously rehitched to the car. Unaware of the dramatic events, Goofy says in the end, "Well, I brought you down, safe and sound."

==Censorship==
*Sometimes, this cartoon cuts out the part where Goofy struggles with the corncob, during the part in which he sticks his fork in a light socket and then, the resulting electric shock pops the corn into popcorn.
*In the Norwegian and Swedish broadcast of From All of Us to All of You, the scene where Goofy sticks his fork in a light socket is cut, along with most of the trailers way downhill.

==Other references==
This cartoon was later adapted into a comic strip story titled The Unhappy Campers in which they replaced Donald with Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse and Pluto (Disney)|Pluto. This was because Donald was not a character in the Mickey Mouse Comic Strip at the time.

The film is also part of the Christmas show From All of Us to All of You.
 The Outsiders.
