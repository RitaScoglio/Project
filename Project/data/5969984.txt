==Plot==
Antoine (Kadeem Hardison) and Kenny Tyler (Marlon Wayans), two close brothers, are shown as children playing in a basketball game in the year 1986. Their motto for each other is "A&K: All the Way", created by their mother. Their father, James Tyler, is coaching the team and directs Kenny to take the last shot for the win since they are in deficit, but Kenny passes the ball to Antoine out of fright, who misses. Later that night, Kenny and Antoine are playing basketball in their front yard, where Kenny tries to cheer Antoine up, who is still upset about missing the shot. James tells them that all they have to do is stick together and anything can happen.

The film fast forwards to the present-day and both Antoine and Kenny are attending the University of Washington and make up a famed duo on their college basketball team, the Huskies. The team goes out to a night club to celebrate their most recent win. While at the nightclub Kenny meets R.C. St. John (Michael Michele), a reporter for UW, with whom he sparks an interest in.

Later, Washington is playing a road game at UCLA. During the game, When Antoine slam dunks a ball and when hes hanging from the rim shouting out in victory, he suddenly cries out in pain. He has suffered a heart attack, unbeknownst to the team at that time. He is carried off the court and tragically dies in the ambulance car before reaching the hospital. Coach Pederson (David Paymer), the head coach, choked up, informs Kenny and the team after the game that Antoine has passed away. Devastated, Kenny cries into his coachs arms as the team moves to comfort him.

The next game shows Antoines jersey number being retired as a sign of respect. However, the team begins falling apart. Without his brother by his side, Kenny loses his drive and is constantly hounded by the press. During one game, however, odd sequences begin to occur, leading to a surprising win (later learned to be contrived by Antoines spirit). Antoine later appears to Kenny in the locker room, which initially frightens Kenny, though he eventually realizes it is indeed Antoine. The brothers share a happy reunion. Antoine explains that the reason hes back is because Kenny called him and that hes the only one who can see and hear him.
 
Kennys teammates begin to question Kennys concerning behavior (as they can not see Antoine). Kenny concedes into telling his teammates about Antoines reemergence, who are in disbelief. The team is reluctant to believe Kenny, but are convinced once Antoine uses supernatural forces to persuade them. Antoine begins to help the team.
 NCAA tournament, for the first time in years. Meanwhile Kennys relationship with R.C. deepens, despite Antoines efforts to disband the two as he believes R.C. is only out to get a story on him, which is partially true, as she is originally prepared to submit a story to the paper on him upon his revelation to her that Antoine is in fact aiding the team, though she eventually decides against it.

The rest of the team begins to have misgivings about Antoine aiding them in their games. They confront Kenny on the matter, As one fellow player states that Antoine is a ball hog. "He was when he was alive and no disrespect is even worse as a dead man." Kenny informs Antoine. Antoine becomes irate, and in a fit of supernatural power, wrecks the room theyre in. After calming down, Antoine relents to Kenny that he never wanted to die, As he had things he wanted to do, he had plans. Kenny tells the team he wants Antoine to stay, clearly because he doesnt want to lose his brother again. However, in a game before the national championship, Antoines antics seriously injure a rival player who was also a close friend of Kennys. While Kenny is visiting the player at the hospital, R.C. comes to see how hes doing and knows its because of Antoine, having discovered his spirit and clues in a games footage. R.C. tells Kenny that even though Antoine is dead, Kennys still letting him run his life. To which Kenny tells her she doesnt understand how hard its been for him to live his life without his brother. R.C. understands but says that Kenny will never truly live unless he lets Antoine go. Kenny then tells Antoine not to interfere during the Championship game with the team by his side, or they will voluntarily forfeit. Disappointed, Antoine leaves, but lingers nearby.

The team plays poorly in the first half of the championship game. At halftime, Kenny gives a speech to fire the team up, telling them that they still have Antoine in their hearts, with the coach being proud that Kenny has finally stepped up as the leader he wanted him to be, and Antoine in tears, proud of his brother. The team goes back in the second half with an impressive rally to bring the game close. Kenny attempts the game winning shot. Antoine tries to help but Kenny tells him not to, as he makes the shot on his own and the Huskies win the championship for the very first time. With his job completed, Antoine makes his way back to Heaven. Kenny stops him and attempts to have one final moment with his brother. Antoine tells Kenny that he is proud of him (as he never let Kenny do things on his own) and that he will always be with him as he reminds Kenny what their father told them as kids. Kenny returns to celebrate with his team. Antoine goes off into the distance under an array of lights. Coach Pederson sees this and asks Kenny if this was Antoine (thats our sixth man, wasnt it?), to which Kenny admits, finally able to say "A&K all the way".
