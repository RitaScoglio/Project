They discover the area has no electricity or phone coverage, as Julianne tries to settle in despite her fear of water and inability to swim. Mitch enjoys the country life, and when Julianne wants to enter town to call her parents to confirm her safety, he gets overprotective of her.

While the two weeks go by, Julianne is eager to return home to start their new lives, but Mitch refuses to go back to that life, wanting them to stay put in his ideal setting, even when Julianne cannot find her birth control pills to prevent her pregnancy. When Julianne finds out Mitch had stalked her before they met and got married, she attempts to leave, and she sees a grave in the woods across the lake before Mitch brings her back. To ensure she doesnt do the same again, Mitch disposes of their boat.

Julianne counterattacks and uses the shotgun he brought back to shoot him in the arm, as he remains alive but he can barely move. Freeing herself, Julianne leaves him for dead with the gun.
