==Production==
Vinayak: While I was doing a film with Sagar gaaru, Bellamkonda Suresh gaaru used to come to the sets. He watched me assisting Sagar gaaru and promised me that hell give me a break definitely. After Paaduthaa Theeyagaa, I was not doing much as an assistant and thus started working on my own scripts. When he offered me a film, I was thrilled and narrated the story to NTR. NTR liked the subject - it was a love story - but Kodali Nani didnt like it. After a couple of days, I narrated another story that was instantly liked and taken to the sets, and that was the story of Aadi. We went to Mumbai for the heroine hunt... In fact, we saw Arti Agarwal but she just signed on the dotted line for Nuvvu Naaku Nacchaav! We also considered Ayesha Takia but our cameraman felt that she wasnt a right choice for NTR. Seeing the Fair & Lovely ad, I felt Trisha will be an ideal choice but my sister didnt like her. We dropped that idea too with a primary belief that if ladies didnt like much, then it will just not work out. While in Mumbai still, we also met Sada also there but shed have been so lean beside NTR, we thought and we dropped her too. During all this, the shooting was already in progress! Thus, we had to find just someone.thats how it all happened. 

==Reception==
