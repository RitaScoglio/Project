==Reception==

The reviewer at the Canuxploitation website, which is devoted to Canadian B-movies, thought that The Great Land of Small was "a real oddity", labelling it "a half-baked fantasy". Although praising the inclusion of Cirque du Soleil, he thought of The Great Land of Small as one of Demers least successful films. They thought that the film could be rated "W" for "What the Hell?", thereby reflecting the idea that it was " eird" but "not trippy enough to be interesting". Arguing that the beginning of the film was "tediously padded", they thought that the subplot based around Mimmick and Flannigan was unnecessary, and that the actual Great Land of Small &ndash; while envisioned as a place like the Land of Oz or The Neverending Storys Fantasia &ndash; was "a distinct disappointment" due to its "embarrassingly low-budget production design, and cheap editing tricks".
