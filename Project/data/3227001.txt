 TV broadcasts.  It was eventually included as one of the cartoons featured in A Salute to Father (later renamed Goofys Salute to Father), a 1961 episode of the Walt Disney anthology series, but the ending was changed.  After being subjected to the exploding cigar gag (see below), the revised ending had Goofy announcing that he quits smoking for good.

==Plot==

In this cartoon, we start with flashbacks featuring a "Goofy"-like version of Christopher Columbus, who is given a cigar by a Native American. His three ships bring it back to their country, with smoke floating from them. A man in Europe rolls a cigar with a leaf and a midget lights it with a small torch, and we see the impact of the popularity of smoking today.

Then we fade to Goofy, in the role of George Geef, who is an extreme nicotine Substance dependence|addict, smoking various cigarettes, cigars and smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipes, as we watch him smoke during the evening and as he goes to bed (as a huge cloud of smoke covers his head), when he wakes up in the morning, as he shaves, as he drinks coffee and at work. But soon his throat tickles and his eyes get irritated and he cannot blow out his matches. So he throws away all of his smoking products and decides to quit. It works fine at first, and feels he can do it.

But then the boss congratulates George for being able to quit smoking, and as he lights up a cigarette, he says "It aint easy. If it was, Id quit!" Another employee, who is now a father, nearly offers George a cigar in honor of the occasion, but then remembers that he quit smoking. Almost everyone at the office still smokes, and George admits that he loves smoking, and he babbles like crazy and runs out of the office like a madman, leading into the following montage...
