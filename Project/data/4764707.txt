Wild Man Blues is a 1997 documentary film directed by Barbara Kopple, about the musical avocation of actor/director/comic Woody Allen. The film takes its name from a jazz composition sometimes attributed to Jelly Roll Morton and sometimes to Louis Armstrong and recorded by both (among others). Allens love of early 20th century New Orleans music is depicted through his 1996 tour of Europe with his New Orleans Jazz Band.  Allen has played clarinet with this band for over 25 years.

Although Allens European tour is the films primary focus, it was also notable as the first major public showcase for Allens relationship with Soon-Yi Previn.

Since the deletion of its original, contemporaneous VHS releases, the film has had only an obscure afterlife on DVD. In April 2012 the film was featured as a bonus disc on an Australian box set of Allens films, and similarly appeared as an extra in a UK Region 2 box set in July 2014. Although the film is not available as a standalone DVD in any of the main English-speaking countries, it has been released singly in various Region 2 pressings around Europe, with relevant (optional) subtitles. RCA Compact Disc and later digitally
