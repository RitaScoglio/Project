 novel of soundtrack by the band Toto (band)|Toto. The plot, set several millennia in the future, concerns the conflict between rival noble families as they battle for control of the planet Arrakis (aka "Dune"), which is the only planet in the universe that possesses the spice "melange (fictional drug)|melange", the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe.

After the success of the novel, attempts to adapt Dune for a film began as early as 1971. A lengthy process of "development hell" followed throughout the 1970s, during which time both Arthur P. Jacobs and Alejandro Jodorowsky tried to bring their visions to the screen. In 1981, executive producer Dino De Laurentiis hired Lynch as director.

The film was negatively received by critics,  and was an American box office bomb.  Upon its release, Lynch distanced himself from the project, stating that pressure from both producers and financiers restrained his artistic control and denied him final cut privilege. At least three different versions have been released worldwide. In some cuts, Lynchs name is replaced in the credits with the name Alan Smithee, a pseudonym used by directors who wished not to be associated with a film for which they would normally be credited.

==Production==
 

===Early attempts=== Magma for some of the music, Dan OBannon for the visual effects, artists H. R. Giger, Jean Giraud and Chris Foss for set and character design and, for the cast, Salvador Dalí as The Emperor, Orson Welles as Baron Harkonnen, Mick Jagger as Feyd-Rautha, Udo Kier as Piter de Vries, David Carradine as Leto Atreides, his son, Brontis Jodorowsky, 12 years old at the time, as the protagonist Paul Atreides, Gloria Swanson, among others.    The project was ultimately abandoned when Jodorowsky was unable to get funding for the film. However, the work that Jodorowsky and his team put into the film had an impact on subsequent science fiction films, most directly the 1979 Alien (film)|Alien, written by OBannon, which shared much of the same creative team for the visual design as had been assembled for Jodorowskys film. A 2013 documentary, Jodorowskys Dune, was made about Jodorowskys failed attempt at an adaptation.

===De Laurentiiss first attempt=== The Battle of Algiers as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science fiction film, Blade Runner (1982). As he recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:

 But after seven months I dropped out of Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer had come up with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent distillation of Frank Herberts. But I also realised Dune was going to take a lot more work—at least two and a half years worth. And I didnt have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.

===Lynchs screenplay and direction===
In 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the Dune sequels (written and unwritten). After seeing  .  He agreed to direct Dune and write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, known the story, or even been interested in science fiction.  Lynch worked on the script for six months with Eric Bergen and Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts.

On March 30, 1983, with the 135-page sixth draft of the script, Dune finally began shooting. It was shot entirely in Mexico. With a budget of over $40 million, Dune required 80 sets built on 16 sound stages and a total crew of 1700. Many of the exterior shots were filmed in the Samalayuca Dune Fields in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua.    

===Editing===
Upon completion, the rough cut of Dune without post-production effects ran over four hours long, but Lynchs intended cut of the film (as reflected in the 7th and final draft of the script) was almost three hours long.

However, Universal and the films financiers expected a standard, two-hour cut of the film. To reduce the run time, producers Dino De Laurentiis, his daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis|Raffaella, and director Lynch excised numerous scenes, filmed new scenes that simplified or concentrated plot elements, and added voice-over narrations, plus a new introduction by Virginia Madsen. Contrary to popular rumors, Lynch made no other version besides the theatrical cut. However, a TV version was aired in 1988 in two parts totaling 186 minutes including a "What happened last night" recap and second credit roll. Lynch disavowed this version and had his name removed from the credits, being credited as Alan Smithee instead. Additionally, several longer versions have been spliced together.    Although Universal has approached Lynch for a possible directors cut of the film, Lynch has declined every offer and prefers not to discuss Dune in interviews. 

==Release== premiered in Washington, D.C., on December 3, 1984, at The Kennedy Center and was released worldwide on December 14. Pre-release publicity was extensive, not only because it was based on a best-selling novel, but because it was directed by Lynch, who had had success with Eraserhead and The Elephant Man. Several magazines followed the production and published articles praising the film before its release,  all part of the advertising and merchandising of Dune, which also included a documentary for television as well as items placed in toy stores. 

===Box office===
The film opened on December 14, 1984, in 915 theaters and earned $6,025,091 in its opening weekend, ranking #2 in the domestic box office behind Beverly Hills Cop.  By the end of its run, Dune had grossed $30,925,690. On an estimated $40 million budget, the film was considered a box office bomb. 

===Critical reception===
  with Gene Siskel and Ebert, Siskel began his review by saying "its physically ugly, it contains at least a dozen gory gross-out scenes, some of its special effects are cheap—surprisingly cheap because this film cost a reported $40–45 million—and its story is confusing beyond belief. In case I havent made myself clear, I hated watching this film."  The film was later listed as the worst film of 1984 in their "Stinkers of 1984" episode.  Other negative reviews focused on the same issues as well as on the length of the film. 

Janet Maslin of The New York Times also gave Dune a negative review of 1 star out of 5. She said that, "Several of the characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position of being able to understand what goes on in the movie" and explained that the plot was "perilously overloaded, as is virtually everything else about it."   
 Blue Meanie come to life." 

Richard Corliss of Time (magazine)|Time magazine gave Dune a negative review, stating that "Most sci-fi movies offer escape, a holiday from homework, but Dune is as difficult as a final exam. You have to cram for it." He noted that "MacLachlan, 25, grows impressively in the role; his features, soft and spoiled at the beginning, take on a he-manly glamour once he assumes his mission." He ended by saying "The actors seem hypnotized by the spell Lynch has woven around them—especially the lustrous Francesca Annis, as Pauls mother, who whispers her lines with the urgency of erotic revelation. In those moments when Annis is onscreen, Dune finds the emotional center that has eluded it in its parade of rococo decor and austere special effects. She reminds us of what movies can achieve when they have a heart as well as a mind."

While most critics were negative towards Dune, critic and science fiction writer Harlan Ellison was of a different opinion at the time. In his 1989 book of film criticism, Harlan Ellisons Watching, he says that the $42 million production failed because critics were denied screenings at the last minute after several re-schedules, a decision by Universal that, according to Ellison, made the film community feel nervous and negative towards Dune before its release.  Ellison eventually became one of the films few positive reviewers.

Science fiction historian John Clute argued that while Lynchs Dune "spared nothing to achieve its striking visual effects", the film adaptation "unfortunately-perhaps inevitably-reduced Herberts dense text to a melodrama". 

The few more favorable reviews praised Lynchs Film noir|noir-baroque approach to the film. Others compare it to other Lynch films that are equally hard to access, such as Eraserhead, and assert that in order to watch it, the viewer must first be aware of the Dune universe. In the years since its initial release Dune has gained more positive reviews from online critics  and viewers.  As of January 2015, it holds a 56% rating on Rotten Tomatoes  based on 41 reviews.

As a result of its poor commercial and critical reception, all initial plans for Dune sequels were canceled. It was reported that David Lynch was working on the screenplay for Dune Messiah  and was hired to direct a second and a third Dune film. In retrospect, Lynch acknowledged he should never have directed Dune: 
 I started selling out on Dune. Looking back, its no ones fault but my own. I probably shouldnt have done that picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the structure to do them in. There was so much room to create a world. But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis of what kind of film they expected, and I knew I didnt have final cut.  

In the introduction for his 1985 short story collection Eye (short story collection)|Eye, author Herbert discussed the films reception and his participation in the production, complimented Lynch, and listed scenes that were shot but left out of the released version. He wrote, "I enjoyed the film even as a cut and I told it as I saw it: What reached the screen is a visual feast that begins as Dune begins and you hear my dialogue all through it." Herbert also commented, "I have my quibbles about the film, of course. Paul was a man playing god, not a god who could make it rain."

The movie won a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture.
