Runaway Brain is an animated short film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation Paris, France, and starring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse. In the short, Mickey is desperate to earn money to pay for an anniversary gift for Minnie. He applies as a lab assistant for Dr. Frankenollie, but finds he is looking for a donor to switch brains with the monster he created. Featuring animation by animator Andreas Deja, it was first released in 1995 attached to two Disney films; A Goofy Movie and A Kid in King Arthurs Court. It would be the final original Mickey Mouse theatrical animated short until Get a Horse! in 2013.

==Plot== Pluto (voiced FrankenOllie Johnston|ollie (voiced by Kelsey Grammer) for a day of "mindless work" that would pay $999.99. Upon reaching the home of the simian Dr. Frankenollie, Mickey is dropped down a trapdoor into Frankenollies laboratory, where the doctor plans to switch Mickeys brain with that of the 15 foot tall Julius (voiced by Jim Cummings and modeled after Pete (Disney)|Pete). The experiment causes an explosion that kills Frankenollie, but the brain transfer is a success, with Mickeys mind ending up in Julius giant body and Julius in control of Mickeys body that makes him have a werewolf-like behavior.

The dimwitted and insane Julius finds Mickeys wallet and notices a photo of Minnie, whom he instantly becomes smitten with. He escapes from the laboratory and finds Minnie while she is shopping for swimsuits and mistakes Julius for Mickey. Mickey arrives in Julius body to save Minnie, but Minnie mistakes Mickey for a monster (due to his looks) and screams for help until Mickey convinces her of who he is. Julius continues to pursue Minnie, leading to a battle between Mickey and Julius during which they land on a telephone line and are electrocuted, which causes their minds to switch back to their original bodies. Mickey manages to tie Julius up with a rope atop a 100 story building and rescue Minnie. Mickey finds a billboard to the Hawaiian vacation getaway to make Julius be a yo-yo. The two travel to Hawaii together on an inflatable boat pulled by Julius as he swims after the photo of Minnie in Mickeys wallet, which is attached to a fishing line manned by Mickey.
