Corvette Summer is an American film, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1978 starring Mark Hamill and Annie Potts. It tells the story of a lonely, car-obsessed California teenager and the theft of his beloved customized Corvette Stingray.

==Plot summary==
  Las Vegas.  On the way, he meets Vanessa (Annie Potts) who is a self-described "prostitute-in-training." 

Kenny finds work in a Vegas car wash, and one day spots his car. He follows it to a local garage, where he has a run-in with the garage owner, Wayne Lowry (Kim Milford), before being rescued by Vanessa. Lowry contacts Kenny’s high school teacher, Ed McGrath (Eugene Roche), and McGrath then comes to Las Vegas. During a conversation with McGrath, Kenny is crushed to learn that this admired teacher of his had arranged for the theft of the Corvette to help himself out of financial trouble. When McGrath suggests Kenny go to work for Lowry, Kenny agrees to it. He will make good money, but secretly plans to steal the Corvette back from Lowry.

Eventually, Kenny completes his plans, steals the car back, saves Vanessa from her life of prostitution, wins a wild car chase, and returns in triumph with the Corvette – and Vanessa – to his old high school.

=== The Corvette ===

There were two Corvettes made for the film, a main car and a "backup" model, both built for MGM by Dick Korkes of Korkys Kustom Studios. The main car was often displayed during the films publicity tour, and both cars were later sold by MGM to private parties. The original car was sold to an Australian collector and "restored" to look different from how it appears in the film.  An original mold of the car was displayed at the Corvette Americana Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, and is now part of the collection of the National Corvette Museum. The "backup" car remained in the U.S., was owned for a while by Mike Yager of Mid America Motorworks in Effingham, Illinois, and was on display there between periodic car shows.  Mike Yager sold the car to a private collector in late 2009.

== Critical reception and box office ==
Critic Frank Rich of Time (magazine)|Time magazine thought the movie was an appropriate summer "popcorn flick". He wrote "As long as one doesnt demand too much of it, Corvette Summer delivers a very pleasant two hours of escape."  TV Guide agreed, calling the film "all in all a very funny movie with enough solid, believable story to take it beyond the realm of teenage summer fare." 

Janet Maslin of The New York Times, however, wasnt as taken with the film. She wrote, "The movie takes a slender, boyish conceit — of the sort that is suddenly so popular among Hollywoods current batch of boy wonders — and invests it with silliness rather than whimsy." 

Overall, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 57% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on seven reviews. 

Corvette Summer generated a total domestic gross of $15,500,000.

==Awards and nominations==
* Annie Potts was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1979 for "Best Motion Picture Acting Debut – Female" for Corvette Summer.

== Allusions in popular culture ==
