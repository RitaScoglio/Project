==Plot==
Harold Lamb (Harold Lloyd), a bright-eyed but naïve young man, enrolls at Tate University. On the train there, he meets Peggy (Jobyna Ralston). They are attracted to each other. 
 title cards as "what your mother was like when she was young".

He tries out for the football team. The coach (Pat Harmon) is unimpressed, but as Harold has damaged their only practice tackle dummy, the coach uses him in its place. At the end of practice, though he approves of Harolds enthusiasm (undiminished after repeated tackling), the coach is about to dismiss the freshman when Chet Trask (James Anderson), the captain and star of the team, suggests making him their water boy, while letting him think he has made the squad. 
 basting stitches, but Harold puts it on and hopes for the best. During the party, his clothes start to fall apart, despite the efforts of the tailor (hiding in a side room) to effect repairs. When Harold sees the College Cad being too forward with Peggy, working as a hatcheck girl, Harold knocks him down. The incensed Cad then tells him just what everyone really thinks of him. Peggy advises him to stop putting on an act and be himself.

Harold is determined to prove himself by getting into the big football game.  His chance comes when the other team proves too tough, injuring so many of Tate Colleges players that the coach runs out of substitutes. Hounded by Harold and warned that he will forfeit if he cannot come up with another player, the coach reluctantly lets Harold go in. The first few plays are disastrous. Finally, he breaks free and is on his way to winning the game, but, mindful of a referees prior instruction that he is to stop playing when he hears the whistle, drops the football just outside the end zone when a non-football whistle sounds. The other team recovers the ball with only a minute left to play. His teammates are disheartened, but Harold rouses them to make a final effort. He chases down the opposing ball carrier, knocks the football loose, scoops it up and runs it all the way back for the winning touchdown as time runs out. Tate prevails by a score of 6 to 3, which at last earns him the respect and popularity he was after. To top it off, Peggy passes him a note proclaiming her love for him.

==Background== USC campus Rose Bowl, Big Game between UC Berkeley and Stanford University.  The football game sequence was reused by Lloyd and director Preston Sturges in Lloyds last film, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock (1947).  

The Freshman is widely considered one of Lloyds most hilarious, well-constructed films.  It was one of Lloyds few films to remain widely available after the sound era, and Lloyd reissued the film (with cuts) and used extended scenes in compilation films of the 1960s.  The DVD release of Lloyds films in 2004 includes the full, restored version as shown in the 1920s.

Pete the Pup makes a cameo in the movie.

== Copyright lawsuit ==
American humorist and author H. C. Witwer sued Lloyd in April 1929 for $2,300,000 over The Freshman, claiming that it was "pirated" from Witwers short story "The Emancipation of Rodney", first published in 1915.  When Witwer died from liver failure in Los Angeles, California, on August 9, 1929, the lawsuit had not been settled.    Witwers widow pursued the lawsuit and won a judgment against Lloyd in November 1930.  On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals overturned the ruling and Witwers widow received nothing.
