}} romantic comedy-drama videographer working on a documentary called Reality Bites about the disenfranchised lives of her friends and roommates. Their challenges exemplify some of the career and lifestyle choices faced by Generation&nbsp;X. The film was well-received critically and commercially.

==Plot==
Four friends who recently graduated from college live together in Houston, Texas. Coffee-house guitarist Troy Dyer and budding filmmaker Lelaina Pierce are attracted to each other, although they have not acted on their feelings save for one brief, drunken encounter. Troy is floundering, having lost several minimum wage jobs—the last of which he loses early in the film for stealing a candy bar from his employer. Lelaina was valedictorian of her university, and has aspirations to become a documentarian, although initially having to settle for a position as production assistant to a rude and obnoxious TV host.

Lelaina meets Michael Grates when she throws a cigarette into his Convertible (car)|convertible, causing him to crash into her car. The two soon begin to date. He works at an MTV-like cable channel called "In Your Face" as an executive, and after learning about a documentary shes been working on, wants to get it aired on his network.
 The Gap, come out to his conservative parents.

After an impulsive act of retribution, Lelaina loses her job, which causes some tension with her roommates. Eventually, Vickies AIDS test comes back negative and Sammy comes out to his parents (and he even starts dating) and the two manage to resume their lives.

Meanwhile, Lelainas relationship with Michael dissolves after he helps her sell the documentary to his network, only to let them edit it into a stylized montage that she feels compromises her artistic vision. Lelaina and Troy then sleep together and confess their love. The morning after, he avoids her, and after a messy confrontation, leaves town. After Troys father dies, he forces himself to reevaluate his life, deciding to attempt a relationship with Lelaina.

Troy and Lelaina reunite and make amends after Troy returns from his fathers funeral in Chicago. While we do not see what happens to Michael, during the credits there is an abrupt break where two characters, "Laina" and "Roy", who are obvious parodies of Lelaina and Troy, have an argument about their relationship. As the "shows" credits roll, Michaels name is revealed as the producer, implying that he has turned the failed relationship into the subject of a new show on his network.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1991 producer Michael Shamberg had an idea to make a film about people in their twenties.    He had read a screenplay entitled Blue Bayou written by Helen Childress on spec in 1990.  He liked it and met with her where she proceeded to tell him about her life and friends and their struggle to find work during a recession in the United States at the time.    For three years she wrote and rewrote Reality Bites, generating 70 different drafts. Childress decided to use her friends, their personalities and experiences as the basis for her film.   
 s work in The Ben Stiller Show gave the films producers the trust to allow him to direct the film]]
The films producers saw the pilot episode for The Ben Stiller Show and approached Stiller to direct it, but not act in it.  He signed on to direct in 1992 and worked with Childress for nine to ten months developing the script.    Initially, Childress, working with producer Stacey Sher, had figured out the characters of Lelaina and Troy but could not come up with a credible character to complete the love triangle. Stiller suggested that he could play that third person.  As a result, the Michael character changed from a 35-year-old advertising executive trying to market Japanese candy bars in America to a television executive in his twenties.  They also changed the structure of the film. Originally, Vickie, Sammy and Troy had more fleshed out storylines, but Stiller felt that he could not tell them fully and decided to focus on the relationship between Lelaina and Troy. 
 Universal Pictures had agreed to finance the film. 
 The House of the Spirits and "found it very true to life."   She further speculated in an interview, "I think my character is very close to what I would probably have ended up as if I hadnt become an actress".  Hawke was at this point unhappy with the direction his career was taking; the actor recalled that his career was in a lull after the buzz from Dead Poets Society had faded. Ryder was a fan of his work and stipulated in her contract that her involvement in the film was dependent on Hawke starring opposite her.

Garofalo knew Stiller from working together on The Ben Stiller Show and the films producers felt that her style of comedy was perfect for the character of Vickie.  She said that Parker Posey, Anne Heche, and Gwyneth Paltrow were all up for the role. The studio wanted Paltrow, but Ryder supported Garofalo for the role after making a connection with her.  Before filming began Garofalo was fired from the production because Stiller did not like her attitude during rehearsal. Garofalo was rehired after Ryder stepped in on her behalf. Garofalo stated later that she has a really poor work ethic and hates to rehearse.    Stiller met Steve Zahn through Hawke, with whom Zahn was starring in a play, and he was impressed by how funny Zahn was. The actor went to Los Angeles, California, and tested for the film. He felt strongly about playing a gay character coming out of the closet. 
===Shooting===
Principal photography lasted 42 days on a budget of $11.5 million.  The filmmakers shot many of the exteriors in Houston (including a scene on top of the Two Shell Plaza building) where the film is set but most of the interiors were shot in Los Angeles, because it was cheaper to do so there.  During filming, Stiller encouraged Childress to be on location and talk with the actors about their characters.

 . RCA aggressively marketed the album and had five tracks on rotation on radio and MTV.  The video for Crowded Houses "Locked Out" was updated to include footage from the film. In addition, the video for "Spin the Bottle" by the Juliana Hatfield Three was directed by Stiller and featured clips from the film as well.

==Release==
Reality Bites went through four test screenings with a fairly decent reaction,  before it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1994,    and was released in the United States on February 18, 1994.

===Box office===
The film grossed $5.1 million in 1,149 theaters on its opening weekend.    Initially, Reality Bites did not perform as well at the box office as the studio had hoped. In six weeks it grossed $18.3 million, more than the films $11 million production budget.    Bruce Feldman, Universal Pictures Vice-President of Marketing said, "The media labeled it as a Generation&nbsp;X picture, while we thought it was a comedy with broad appeal".  The studio placed advertisements during programs chosen for their appeal to 12-34-year-olds and in interviews Stiller was careful not to mention the phrase, "Generation&nbsp;X".  The film went on to be a moderate hit for Universal and make $20.9 million in North America and $12.3 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $33.3 million. 

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 66% based on reviews from 44 critics. 

 
Caryn James in her review for the New York Times wrote, "Like the generation it presents so appealingly, it doesnt see any point in getting all bent out of shape and overambitious. But it knows how to hang out and have a great time". 
In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, "By aiming specifically—and accurately—at characters in their twenties, debuting screenwriter Helen Childress and first-time director Stiller achieve something even greater: they encapsulate an era". 
Time (magazine)|Time magazines Richard Schickel wrote, "the movie bobs along on this stream of funny offhandedness, never losing its balance. If its 10 oclock, and you want to know where your supposedly grownup children are, this is a good place to look for them". 

When asked in 2007 how well Reality Bites had aged, Janeane Garofalo replied, "I think it means a lot more to people younger than me. I was not the target audience. I was 29 playing a 21-year-old, so I dont think I understand why younger people like it." 

In 2013, Stiller proposed a television series sequel.   

==Lawsuit==
In 2005, the real Dyer (a film financier), sued writer Childress, producer DeVito, and director Stiller.    Dyer claimed that after the 2004 release of the 10th anniversary DVD in which screenwriter, Childress, stated on audio commentary tracks that she wrote the story based on her actual college friends and roommates, that he was forced to deal with past and potential clients "inquiries as to whether he was the fictional character".  The defendants attempted to seek shelter under Californias Strategic lawsuit against public participation|anti-SLAPP statutes but in early 2007 the appeals court denied them SLAPP protection.  The suit was quickly settled after Dyer received a written document from Childress stating he was not the person portrayed in the film.
