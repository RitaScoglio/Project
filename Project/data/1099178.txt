The rats assist Kermit by creating a whispering campaign amongst patrons. However, Minnelli eventually enters and ends up asking Vincent Sardi, Jr. why her portrait was taken down. Rizzo and Yolanda end up giving themselves away by causing havoc as the other rats come out of their hiding place. Vincent discovers Minnellis portrait near the table where Kermit was sitting. This causes Kermit and the rats to be ejected from the restaurant.
 Rowlf is in Delaware working at a dog kennel where the wealthy Mr. Skeffington leaves his beloved dog for the weekend. Another letter that Kermit got was from Bernard Crawford, a Broadway producer who is interested in producing Kermits play.

Kermit meets with Ronnie Crawford, the actual writer of the letter who is willing to fund Manhattan Melodies in order to prove himself to his father Bernard. Despite Bernards doubts, he agrees to fund the show. In his excitement over having finally sold the play, Kermit fails to notice a "Dont Walk" sign and is hit by a car while making his way back to the restaurant. When Ronnie comes to the diner to bring up his fathers approval to Miss Piggy, Jenny, and Pete, he, Jenny, and Miss Piggy go out to look for Kermit.

After Kermit visits the diner with the frogs and plays the Manhattan Melodies theme "Together Again" with a spoon and glasses of water, his friends recognize him. Miss Piggy restores his memory with a punch after Kermit mocks the idea of romance between a pig and a frog. Kermit realizes that what the script needs is more "frogs and dogs and bears and chickens and whatever", and adds the cast members many friends from around the country to the show as supernumeraries.

With the expanded cast, Ronnies producing, and Jennys costumes, Manhattan Melodies is successful ("Right Where I Belong"/"Somebodys Getting Married"/"Waiting for the Wedding"). On Opening Night, Piggy substitutes a real minister for Gonzo in the wedding scene finale where the other Muppet characters, the Muppets from Sesame Street and Uncle Traveling Matt from Fraggle Rock, attend. Kermit is surprised, but reluctantly says "I do" and he and Miss Piggy are wed ("Hell Make Me Happy"/"The Ceremony"). Crazy Harry, Pops, the Newsman, Sam Eagle, Ernie, Bert and Cookie Monster are in the wedding finale waiting for Kermit and Miss Piggy to arrive. And when Kermit and Miss Piggy get finally married, the film ends after the part: "What better way could anything end, hand in hand with a friend".
