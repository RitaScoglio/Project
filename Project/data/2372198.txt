 1940 western Henry Kings Jesse James. Written by Sam Hellman, the film loosely follows the life of Frank James following the death of his outlaw brother, Jesse James at the hands of the Ford brothers. The film is universally considered historically inaccurate, but was a commercial success and is notable as being the first motion picture for the actress Gene Tierney, who plays a reporter for the newspaper The Denver Star.
