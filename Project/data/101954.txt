== Production ==

 

Saul Zaentz was interested in working with Anthony Minghella after he saw the directors film   took over was the directors preference for Scott Thomas accepted. 

The film was shot on location in Tunisia and Italy.  with a production budget of $31 million. 
 the Godfather trilogy, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now, dreaded the task of editing the film with multiple flashbacks and time frames. Once he began, the possibilities became apparent, some of which took him away from the order of the original script. A reel without sound was made so scene change visuals would be consistent with the quality of the aural aspect between the two. The final cut features over 40 temporal transitions. It was during this time that Murch met Ondaatje and they were able to exchange thoughts about editing the film. 

Two types of plane are used in the film, http://www.impdb.org/index.php?title=The_English_Patient; viewed 1-24-2014.  A De Havilland D.H.82 Tiger Moth and a Boeing-Stearman Model 75. Both are biplanes.  The camp crash scene was made with a .5 scale model.
