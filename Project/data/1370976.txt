Celsius 41.11 is a 2004 political documentary film inspired by, and partially in response to Michael Moores film Fahrenheit 9/11. The title was chosen because, according to the makers of the movie, 41.11&nbsp;°C is "The Temperature at Which the Brain Begins to Die", which is the films tag-line. 
 Democratic President Presidential candidate 2004 United States Presidential general election.
 Citizens United, a conservative political organization. Celsius 41.11 performed less well at the box office than comparable left leaning documentaries and significantly poorer than Fahrenheit 9/11. The producer attributed this to voter fatigue and to a time tabling clash with the World Series.
 PowerPoint presentation with some adding that the speed with which the film had been produced was evident in the quality of the finished product. Opinions as to the quality of the arguments advanced varied with Michael Graham of the National Review stating that the film had done a "solid job" in answering Moores arguments whilst Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide called the film a "shrill, repetitive screed".

==Conception and production== Citizens United. Democratic political position.  "After seeing Moores impact, I wanted to counterpunch", he said to the LA Times in 2004, adding that, "Documentaries have become a weapon of the left".  Celsius 41.11 took six weeks to make  and includes a song, John Boy, specially written and performed by the country music singer Larry Gatlin. 

Celsius 41.11 was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America because it contains a graphic image of an Iraqi torture victim and includes swearing on two occasions. The films producers disagreed with the rating, stating that it wasnt "consistent with other films in theaters." They choose to appeal the rating  but were ultimately unsuccessful. 

==Synopsis==
  
Celsius 41.11 defends Bush against five of the arguments advanced by Fahrenheit 9/11 and additionally criticizes John Kerry, unconvincingly arguing that his opposition to the Vietnam war and his military service in that same war are contradictory positions.  The opening images of the film are of the second plane hitting the World Trade Center on September 11.  The film then moves to clips of the demonstrations against the war in Iraq, including an interview with an unnamed protester who says she would be happy to live under a dictatorship if the ruler provided universal health care.  The next segment shows images of dead children. 

The film alleges that a feud between the White House and the CIA resulted in Bill Clinton refusing to broker the surrender of Osama bin Laden in 1997.  It also contains a list of the terrorist attacks that have occurred since the Iran hostage crisis that one reviewer described as "chilling".  Speeches made by John Kerry and running mate John Edwards on the danger posed by the weapons of mass destruction Iraq was accused of possessing are also included.

==Theatrical release==
Citizens United were prohibited by the   and  . Lionel Chetwynd suggested that the low audiences were due to the films late release date with respect to the 2004 United States Presidential campaign adding that opening on the same weekend as the World Series may have compounded the problem.  Citizens United subsequently printed 200,000 DVDs of the film, many of which were given to its supporters. 

==Response==
In common with Fahrenheit 9/11, Celsius 41.11 proved to be a contentious film.  It received 42 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 11 reviews  and an 11% rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.  The BBC described the newspaper critics response as "irk " commenting that "many newspapers, while not disagreeing with the facts of the documentary, have not been impressed with it as a piece of entertainment." 

Reviewers generally agreed that the film would appeal most to those who were already convinced supporters of George W. Bush and was unlikely to change the views of those who opposed him. Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic said, "Celsius 41.11 isnt going to change many minds."   Michael Graham of the National Review said, "I just don’t think there are a lot of people left willing to be persuaded. Some conservatives will watch and say “See, I told you so!” Liberals will watch and dismiss the arguments as partisan. Undecideds…well, they won’t watch it."  Desson Thompson of the Washington Post and Robert Koehler of Variety (magazine)|Variety said that the film preached to the choir.   Some reviewers said that Celsius 41.11 felt like a campaign ad for Bush    or, possibly, an attack ad against Kerry. 

===Comparisons to Fahrenheit 9/11===
Michael Graham of the National Review praised Celsius 41.11 saying that "unlike Michael Moore’s film, Celsius 41.11 is an actual documentary" and that the film was "far more logical" than Fahrenheit 9/11.  However, Graham also added that "41.11 isnt nearly as emotionally powerful as Moore’s film",  a view with which Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel concurred.  Philip Kennicott of the Washington Post described Moores film, Fahrenheit 9/11, as "well crafted" believing that, while Moore had angered the targets of his film he "went the extra mile, creatively, to do so". In contrast Kennicott described Celsius 41.11 as "dull, lazy and inconsistent".  Celsius 41.11 was criticised for sharing some of what reviewers perceived to be the flaws of Fahrenheit 9/11. For example, Desson Thomson of the Washington Post (although generally positive about Celsius 41.11) said that in the case of both films "the spleen factor could poison small children".  Writing in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Duane Dudek said, "as with Fahrenheit 9/11, its impossible to separate the facts and analysis presented in Celsius from the filmmakers intent."  However, Celsius 41.11 was additionally criticised for failing to share what the reviewers perceived to be virtues of Moores film. Robert Koelher of Variety said that """Celsius" shares Moores blatant Agitprop|agit-prop but none of his humor or entertainment sense".  Similarly, Michael Atikinson of The Village Voice regarded the film as "deliberately ap  Michael Moores modus operandi, minus the humor or any sense of sympathy for real people."  Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe concluded that "Celsius 41.11" doesnt have anything on anyone as pointedly damning or funny as some of what Moore shows of the current Bush administration." 

===Comparison to FahrenHYPE 9/11===
Manohla Dargis of The New York Times compared Celsius 41.11 unfavorably to FahrenHYPE 9/11, another documentary film aimed at rebutting the arguments made by Michael Moore. While Dargis felt that the purpose of FahrenHYPE 9/11 was the detailed rebutting of the arguments put forward by Moores film, she felt that the purpose of Celsius 41.11  was to "make you afraid — very, very afraid". She stated that Celsius 41.11 "presents a vision of the world verging on the apocalyptic". Dargis concluded "finally   interesting only because it represents another unconvincing effort on the part of conservatives to mount a viable critique of Mr. Moore." 

===Criticisms of the production===
The Boston Globe and the New York Times both questioned the reliability of some of the individuals interviewed. The Globe called the experts "occasionally dubious" saying that they "offer  drive-by disses and plain untruths".  Manohla Dargis of the New York Times was particularly critical of the film for not detailing the extent of Mansoor Ijazs investments in the Middle East or "just how intimately familiar he was with the nonsense of the Clinton White House".  Both publications, however, spoke well of the contributions of Fred Thompson with the New York Times calling him "thoughtful"  and the Globe adding that "with his level head and reflective words,   makes partisanship seem dignified." 

Several critics felt that insufficient time had been spent on the film. Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide said that it "bears all the hallmarks of having been thrown together in a heated rush",  a criticism echoed by Robert Koehler of Variety who called the editing "choppy".  Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe described the film as "a seemingly last-minute series of talking heads and montages".  A number of critics compared the style of the film to that of a PowerPoint presentation.    

===Overall response to the film=== echo chamber opposite of Mr. Moores".  Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe called the film "a crude polemical mush".  Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide called it a "shrill, repetitive screed"  Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com said it is "so bad its almost like performance art".  Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice wrote a particularly stinging review calling the movie a "desperate Four wall distribution|four-waller" and "a cut-rate vision of flabby white men defending their own bloodthirsty opportunism".  Selecting it as one of the five worst films of 2004, Matthew Lucas of The Dispatch (Lexington) said of the film, "Displaying nowhere near the artistic flair that Michael Moore possesses, this film shows you that no matter what your political affiliations are, Moore makes a much more entertaining case."
