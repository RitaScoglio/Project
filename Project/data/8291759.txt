}} thriller film starring Dean Cain. It was written and directed by first time filmmaker, Darren Lemke.

==Plot==
After orchestrating a robbery, bank Vice President Jeremy Stanton (Dean Cain) gets lost driving in the desert, en route to meeting his family with a deadline of eight hours.  He listens to tapes by a lifestyle guru (the film is divided into sections titled according to chapters from the gurus best-selling book) and seeks help from a telephone route-finding service, which gives him guidance that does not agree with his map.  At first it seems as if he has succeeded in the perfect crime, but things quickly deteriorate – he is pursued by one of his fellow robbers (Danny Trejo), a ruthless killer whom he double crossed; his wife begins to doubt the choices theyve made; he attempts to turn himself in to a state trooper, who is found dead by his pursuers hand – and self-doubt plagues him.  The film is almost a solo performance, with few other characters except Stanton and Judy (Ashley Scott), the woman from the telephone route-finder service, and tension builds in a Franz Kafka|Kafka-esque style as it becomes clear that things are not what they seem.  Ultimately, it is revealed that Judy has been paid by his pursuers to lead him into a trap.  He is surrounded and one of his pursuers taps on the window as the movie ends.
