==Plot== imperial guard in 1881. After Princess Pei-Pei, for whom Wang has affection, is abducted and taken to the United States, the Emperor of China sends three of his guards to retrieve her. Wang is not one of the three, but he tells them that it was his fault the princess was kidnapped. The Captain of the Imperial Guards first refuses, but when the Royal Interpreter, Wangs uncle, offers to allow Wang to come help with the baggage, the Captain agrees in the hopes that the "foreign devils" would get rid of Wang. In Nevada, Roy OBannon is an outlaw who, with his gang, hijacks the train Wang is on. When Wallace, a member of Roys gang, kills Wangs uncle, Wang chases the outlaws down. However, the gang is well-armed and Wangs only choice is to unhinge the cars and get away on the engine. In the process, Wallace takes over the gang from Roy, and they leave him buried up to his chin in the desert sand. Meanwhile, Pei-Pei, who was tricked into believing she was freely escaping her arranged marriage in China, finds out she has been kidnapped by an agent of Lo Fong, who ran away from the Forbidden City and was viewed as a traitor by the Chinese.
 Crow tribe and ends up reluctantly marrying the tribe chiefs daughter, Falling Leaves. Wang finds Roy in a tavern and, in anger, starts a fight with him that turns into a barroom brawl. The two of them get sent to prison, and after Falling Leaves helps them escape, they become friends. Roy trains Wang in the ways of the cowboy.
 Marshal Nathan Van Cleef, and the two of them narrowly escape. They go to a bordello (which Roy describes as his "hideout"), but after a drunken encounter by Wang, the Marshal eventually catches and arrests them. They find out that Lo Fong is behind the kidnapping of the princess. As they are about to be hanged, Wang manages to break himself free and after Falling Leaves shoots Roy loose, they escape the execution site. Wang, upset over Roy previously telling one of the prostitutes at the bordello he was not Wangs friend, rides off alone to find the princess. However, Roy follows him and the two reunite when Roy saves him from Fong.

The next day, the two partners go to the ransom point, the Carson City Mission church. The three imperial guards arrive with the gold, and Lo Fong has the princess in hand. However, a simple exchange becomes complicated when Wang shows up and Roy points a gun towards Fong. Wang tells his fellow guards that he will not allow them to bring the princess back to China. As the Chinese and Lo Fong fight amongst themselves, Van Cleef arrives and engages Roy in a gunfight. After Roy is limited to one remaining bullet, Van Cleef simultaneously fires both of his guns but Roy (unscathed due to all of Van Cleefs shots missing him and going through the priests robe he wore for a disguise) shoots him in the heart. Wang fights the Imperial Guards whilst Lo Fong chases Pei-Pei through the rafters of the church. After Wang knocks all three Guards unconscious he fights Lo Fong to the bell tower, though one of the Guards is wounded in the fight. Wang ultimately kills Lo Fong by dismantling the bell causing it to hang him. When they awaken, the Imperial Guards decide that they will let the princess stay.

Wallace and his gang also come up to the church, and demand that Roy and Wang come out and fight. But when the two of them get outside the church to face Wallace, Natives from all around surround the gang. At a Chinese cultural celebration Roy thanks Falling Leaves for saving him and they engage in a passionate kiss. At the same time, Pei-Pei holds a smiling Wangs hand. Roy and Wang are shown as sheriffs and ride off to catch a new band of train robbers.

==Cultural references==
* The title (a pun on the Gary Cooper classic High Noon).
* The plot is very similar to the 1971 western film Red Sun, with Deys film starring Chan, Wilson and Goggins in place of respectively Toshiro Mifune, Charles Bronson and Alain Delon.
* Several names used in the film pay homage to earlier westerns. Chans character, "Chon Wang" is meant to sound like John Wayne, and the antagonist, Nathan Van Cleef, is an homage to Lee Van Cleef, who played in the 1976 kung-fu western film The Stranger and the Gunfighter, among other roles in major westerns. In addition, Roy OBannon (Owen Wilsons character) reveals at the end that his real name is Wyatt Earp, which Chon laughingly dismisses as "a terrible name for a cowboy" (the same line having been said earlier by Roy to Chon, playing on the latters names resemblance to John Wayne). 
* The Chinese characters shown in the background during the opening credits are excerpts from a translation of "The Frog Prince."
* The song playing during the first bar-fight sequence is "La Grange" by ZZ Top, the same song that plays during The Dirty Dozen (1967)-style, and in intro of the characters in Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon (1998), an earlier film which starred Owen Wilson.
* The song played when Roy is teaching Chon to be a cowboy is Kid Rocks "Cowboy".
* The line "I dont know karate, but I know crazy" is from the James Brown song "Payback", from the 1973 album of the same name. Though this line is anachronistic in the film as "karate" was not even developed as such in Japan by this time yet. The Legend of Drunken Master (1994). There was no time to choreograph such a scene, so Dey showed Chon blowing bubbles from his mouth, as Wong Fei-hung does in the Drunken Master movie.
* The scene at the end, outside the church and heavily surrounded, is an homage to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).
* The travelling show (seen at the end behind Roy OBannons former gang) has a reference to the western TV series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and also a reference to Sappers Bulldog Drummond character.
