Down to You is a 2000 romantic comedy film about losing a first love. It was directed by Kris Isacsson. The main characters are Alfred Al Connelly (played by Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Imogen (Julia Stiles), and Cyrus (Selma Blair). The cast also includes Ashton Kutcher, Rosario Dawson, Lucie Arnaz, Henry Winkler, and Zak Orth.

== Plot ==
Sophomore Al Connelly (Freddie Prinze Jr.) meets the girl of his dreams, freshman Imogen (Julia Stiles), and true love abounds. The two engage on a whirlwind courtship—they pick a song based on the records from Als parents, eat a cake together, and even make love. Imogens fear of lost youth causes her to push away from Al, and they go their separate ways after Imogen cheats on Al at a party. Al attempts to rebound from the relationship, determined to forget Imogen, and he goes to desperate measures to do so, including suicide by shampoo and problems with his career. In the end, Imogen finds Al when she hears of his attempted suicide and she brings him a book cover that she illustrated featuring the two of them. The two reconcile their differences and get back together showing that love can be obtained. The story is told from the points of view of both Al and Imogen.
