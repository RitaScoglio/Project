 science fiction novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, with a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film centers on the fictional Isla Nublar, an islet located off Central Americas Pacific Coast, near Costa Rica wildlife park cloned dinosaurs.

Before Crichtons novel was published, four studios put in bids for the film rights. With the backing of Universal Studios, Spielberg acquired the rights for $1.5 million before publication in 1990; Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. David Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novels exposition and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii between August and November 1992, and post-production rolled until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed Schindlers List . The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winstons team. To showcase the films sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS (sound system)|DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats.
 3D to greatest films of the 1990s and in some cases of all time, as well as a landmark in the vector of visual effects regarding its computer-generated imagery and animatronics.

Jurassic Park was followed by two sequels,   and Jurassic Park III, both of which were box office successes but received mixed critical responses. A third sequel, Jurassic World, is set for release on June 12, 2015.

==Plot==
 
 John Hammond bioengineering company theme park called Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, a tropical island in an isolated Central American location populated with cloned dinosaurs. After a park worker is killed by a Velociraptor—in spite of an attempted rescue led by the parks game warden, Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck)—the parks investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), demand that experts visit the park and certify it as safe. Gennaro invites the mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). Upon arrival, the group is stunned to see three Brachiosaurus and a herd of Parasaurolophus in the distance.
 DNA of dinosaurs from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber. The DNA strands were incomplete, so DNA from frogs was used to fill in the gaps. The dinosaurs were all cloned genetically as females in order to prevent breeding.

The group is then joined by Hammonds grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the trip from the parks control room. The tour does not go as planned, with the dinosaurs failing to appear and a Triceratops becoming ill. As a tropical storm approaches Isla Nublar, the tour is cut short. Most of the park employees depart on a boat for the mainland and the visitors return to the electric tour vehicles, except Ellie, who stays with the parks veterinarian to study the Triceratops.
 Tyrannosaurus rex to attack the tour group. Grant, Lex, and Tim narrowly escape while the Tyrannosaurus devours Gennaro, injures Malcolm, and pushes one of the vehicles over an embankment. On his way to deliver the embryos to the islands docks, Nedry becomes lost in the dark, crashes his Jeep, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.

Sattler assists Muldoon, in a search for survivors, but they only find Malcolm before the Tyrannosaurus rex returns. They escape in one of the vehicles. Unable to decipher Nedrys code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the parks chief engineer Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) opt to reboot the entire parks system. The group shuts down the parks grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When he fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed as well. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the Velociraptors; Muldoon distracts the raptors while Sattler turns the power back on. She discovers Arnolds severed arm and escapes. Soon after, the raptors ambush and kill Muldoon.
 West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, making the dinosaurs able to do so as well. On the way back to the visitor center, the trio encounter a herd of Gallimimus, when suddenly the Tyrannosaurus emerges from seemingly nowhere and kills one. Grant, Tim and Lex reach the visitor center, and Grant leaves them there as he goes searching for the others. After finding the bunker, Grant and Sattler head back to the visitor center, where the children battle two Velociraptors. The four head to the control room, where Lex restores full power, allowing the group to call for help. While trying to leave, they are cornered by the raptors, but escape when the Tyrannosaurus suddenly appears and kills both raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the entire group flees together. Before they board a helicopter to leave the island, Grant decides not to endorse the park, a choice with which Hammond concurs.

===Development===
 s book attracted the attention of director Steven Spielberg even before publishing. The author was also responsible for the films first scripts.|alt=Michael Crichton wearing a suit.]] Jurassic Park.  Even before publication, Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ER (TV series)|ER. Joseph McBride (writer)|McBride, Joseph (1997). Steven Spielberg. Faber and Faber, 416–9. ISBN 0-571-19177-0  Spielberg considered that what really fascinated him was that Jurassic Park was "a really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind", going beyond a simple monster movie. "Return to Jurassic Park: Dawn of a New Era", Jurassic Park Blu-ray (2011) 

Before the book was published, Crichton demanded a non-negotiable fee of $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. Warner Bros. and Tim Burton, Columbia Pictures and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Fox and Joe Dante bid for the rights,  but Universal Studios eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg. DVD Production Notes   After completing Hook (film)|Hook, Spielberg wanted to film Schindlers List. Music Corporation of America (then Universal Pictures parent company) president Sid Sheinberg gave a green light to the film on the condition that Spielberg made Jurassic Park first.  The director later declared that by choosing a creature-driven thriller, "I was really just trying to make a good sequel to Jaws (film)|Jaws, on land." 

To create the dinosaurs, Spielberg at first thought of hiring   skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Tippett created stop-motion animatics of both the raptors in the kitchen and the Tyrannosaurus attacking the car. But despite go motions attempts at   classes for understanding movements. 

===Writing===
Universal paid Crichton a further $500,000 to adapt his own novel,  which he had finished by the time Spielberg was filming   Magazine, August 1993 (Vol. 24, No.2), pg. 12  Malia Scotch Marmo began a script rewrite in October 1991 over a five-month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant. 

As Spielberg wanted another writer to rework the script, Universal president Casey Silver recommended him David Koepp, co-writer of Death Becomes Her.  Koepp started afresh from Marmos draft, and used Spielbergs idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichtons novel. Shay, Duncan, p. 55–6.  While Koepp tried to avert excessive character detail "because whenever they started talking about their personal lives, you couldnt care less",  he tried to flesh out the characters and make for a more colorful cast, with moments such as Malcolm flirting with Sattler leading to Grants jealousy.  Some characterizations were changed from the novel. Hammond went from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, because Spielberg identified with Hammonds obsession with showmanship. McBride, p. 421–422.  He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged eleven and interested in computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and interested in sports. Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with the younger Joseph Mazzello, and it also allowed him to introduce the sub-plot of Lexs adolescent crush on Grant. Shay, Duncan, p.70.  Koepp changed Grants relationship with the children, making him hostile to them initially to allow for more character development. 

Two scenes from the book were excised, with Spielberg removing the opening sequence with Procompsognathus attacking young children as he found it too horrific,  and Koepp cutting for budgetary reasons the T. rex chasing Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon. Both parts eventually saw inclusion in the film sequels.  Spielberg suggested the addition of the scene where the T. rex pursues a jeep, which at first would only have the characters driving away after listening to the dinosaurs footsteps.

===Post-production===
Special effects work continued on the film, with Tippetts unit adjusting to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices:    models which fed information into the computers to allow themselves to animate the characters like stop motion puppets. In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and Gallimimus. As well as the computer-generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards stunt double.  Compositing the dinosaurs onto the live action scenes took around an hour. Rendering the dinosaurs often took two to four hours per frame, and rendering the T. rex in the rain even took six hours per frame.    Spielberg monitored their progress from Poland during the filming of Schindlers List, Shay, Duncan, p. 138.  having teleconferences four times a week with ILMs crew. The director described working simultaneously in two vastly different productions as "a bipolar experience", where he used "every ounce of intuition on Schindlers List and every ounce of craft in Jurassic Park". 

Along with the digital effects, Spielberg wanted the film to be the first with digital sound. He funded the creation of  ,  were finished by the end of April.  Sound designer Gary Rydstrom considered it a fun process, given the film had all kinds of noise – animal sounds, rain, gunshots, car crashes – and at times no music. During the process, Spielberg would take the weekends to fly from Poland to Paris, where he would meet Rydstrom to see the sound progress.  Jurassic Park was finally completed on May 28, 1993.

==Dinosaurs on screen==
 
 
Despite the title of the film referencing the Jurassic period, most of the dinosaurs featured did not exist until the Cretaceous period, with the exception of Brachiosaurus and Dilophosaurus, both of which lived in the Jurassic period.    The screenplay acknowledges this when Dr. Grant describes the ferocity of the Velociraptor to a young boy, saying "Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period..." 
 Steve Williams sequoias crashing to the ground became the sound of the dinosaurs footsteps.  played by an African cranes mating call, tortoises mating, and human rasps were mixed to formulate various raptor sounds.   Following discoveries made after the films release, most paleontologists theorized that dromaeosaurs like Velociraptor and Deinonychus had feathers.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 472 pp.  methacyl and K-Y Jelly that served as venom.  whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded to be used in the noises of the dinosaurs. 
* Triceratops has an extended cameo, being sick with an unidentified disease. Its appearance was a particular logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected.  The model, operated by eight puppeteers in the Kauai set, wound up being the first dinosaur filmed during production.  Winston also created a baby Triceratops for Ariana Richards to ride on, a scene cut from the film for pacing reasons.  Gary Rydstrom combined the sound of himself breathing into a cardboard tube with the cows near his workplace at Skywalker Ranch to create the Triceratops vocals. 
* Gallimimus are featured in a stampede scene where one of them is devoured by the Tyrannosaurus. The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the T. rex.  Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals.  As reference for the dinosaurs run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus jump over.  The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump.    Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.   
* Parasaurolophus appear in the background during the first encounter with the Brachiosaurus. 

==Release and promotion== three Jurassic Park video games by Sega and Ocean Software,  a toy line by Kenner that was distributed by Hasbro,  McDonalds "Happy Meal|Dino-Sized meals",  and a novelization aimed at young children. 

The films trailers only gave fleeting glimpses of the dinosaurs,  a tactic journalist Josh Horowitz described as "that old Spielberg axiom of never revealing too much" when Spielberg and director Michael Bay did the same for their production of Transformers (film)|Transformers in 2007.  The film was marketed with the tagline "An Adventure 65 Million Years In The Making." This was a joke Spielberg made on set about the genuine, thousands of years old mosquito in amber used for Hammonds walking stick. 

The film premiered at the National Building Museum on June 9, 1993, in Washington, D.C.,   in support of two childrens charities.  Two days later it opened nationwide, in 2,404 theater locations and an estimated 3,400 screens.    Internationally it was equally wide at 3,400 prints.

===Sequels and merchandise===
 
After the enormous success of the film, Spielberg requested Michael Crichton to write a sequel novel, leading to the 1995 book   in 1997, also directed by Spielberg and written by David Koepp.  Another film, Jurassic Park III, was released on 2001 under the direction of Joe Johnston and Spielberg as executive producer, featuring an original script that still incorporated unused elements from Crichtons original Jurassic Park.  A fourth installment Jurassic World is currently under production, with a June 12, 2015 release date. Spielberg again only produces, with Colin Trevorrow directing a script written by himself and Derek Connolly. 

The story of the film was also continued in auxiliary media, at times even unattached to the film sequels themselves. These included a series  of Jurassic Park   (1994),   (2003) and   (2011).
