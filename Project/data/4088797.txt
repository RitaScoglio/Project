Kevin and Rachel move to Los Angeles to follow their dream – making it in cinema. They cant believe their luck when they find the perfect house on a hill called Edendale – right next door to Hollywood. Here, all the neighbors are in "the business", and they have high hopes for Kevin and Rachel.  

But Rachels dreams soon turn to nightmares. First, theres something hiding in the closet, then, the awful crying in the walls, and now, Kevin is acting strange. Terrified, Rachel thinks she must be going crazy – but could her insanity extend to the hill itself?  

As the neighbors eagerly await the completion of Kevins work, Rachel must convince him to leave this place before the powerful Ghosts of Edendale reach through time to possess his very soul.

==Production==
The Ghosts of Edendale as a film is an interesting retracing of film history in the actual locations it was shot.
The story of Tom Mix, his life and death is an integral part of the story, and also an interesting history lesson in Hollywood Lore.
