The Eye Creatures (also known as Attack of the Eye Creatures, with the opening title listed as Attack of  the The  Eye Creatures due to a production error) is a 1965 Science fiction|science-fiction film about an invasion of an unnamed American countryside by a flying saucer and its silent, shambling alien occupants. While the military ineptly attempts to stop the invasion, a group of young people, whose reports to the local police are dismissed as pranks or wild imagination, struggle to defend themselves against the menacing monsters.
 John Ashley. The screenplay was developed by uncredited writers Robert J. Gurney Jr. and Al Martin from the short story "The Cosmic Frame" by Paul W. Fairman (also uncredited). The film was a color remake of the 1957 black and white American International Pictures film Invasion of the Saucer Men, intended to fill out a package of AIP films released to television.

== Plot synopsis ==
A military briefing film shows a hovering flying saucer resembling a domed   who resents the "smoochers" who use his property as a lovers lane, frequently threatening them with a shotgun.

Meanwhile, one of two drunken drifters new in town comes across the dead creature and decides to put it on exhibition as part of his latest get-rich-quick scheme. When he returns to the site after excitedly rushing home to tell his buddy Mike, other aliens arrive, scaring him and causing a deadly heart attack. When the police finally investigate, they assume that Stan ran over the drifter and they arrest the young man, refusing to believe his crazy story.

Having overheard the bar conversation about the Unidentified flying object|UFO, Lt. Robertson reports to his commander, who reluctantly authorizes a cordon around the saucer. They eventually accidentally blow up the spaceship and congratulate themselves for their effective defense, not realizing that the creatures werent in their craft and are still roaming the woods.

Easily escaping from the police, Stan and Susan meet up with the dead drifters friend Mike and the three of them attempt to prove the alien danger to the community. Mike is cornered and attacked by the angry creatures, but Stan and Susan manage to flee and accidentally discover the monsters explode when exposed to bright light. Unfortunately, after the autopsy showed that the victim earlier died from an alcohol-induced heart attack and that Stan had not killed him, the police want nothing more to do with him and refuse to help. The teenagers then gather their friends together and drive out to the clearing where they left Mike. Surrounding the aliens with their cars, the teens use their headlights to evaporate the remaining creatures. Mike survives his attack, and Stan and Susan resume their interrupted plans to elope.

==Production==
Buchanan had made Free, White and 21 (1963), which was distributed by AIP. They hired the director to make a series of low-budget color remakes of old AIP films, of which this was the first. Buchanan later called them his "wretched remakes". Goodsell, Greg, "The Weird and Wacky World of Larry Buchanan", Filmfax, No. 38 April/May 1993 p 64 

The movie was shot in 16mm over several weeks in  , but the rest of the cast were locals. Ashley has stated that his salary took up more than half the budget. 

Most of the film was shot at the ranch of wealthy businessman Gordon McLendon. Ashley claimed that the film ranks "with some of the worst all-time horror films ever made", but said it was a professional operation and Buchanan treated him very well. 

== Critical review ==
The Eye Creatures is infamous for its many production errors and goofs.  The story takes place during a single night, but movie criticism website Rotten Tomatoes  pointed out that these night scenes included intercut shots from obvious daylight shoots (likely intended to be rendered as Day for night|day-for-night shots but not appearing as such in the final film). A string can be observed during a scene where a creatures severed hand creeps toward Susan and Stan.

The creature costumes presented particular problems for Buchanan. There were not enough full costumes for all the creature actors during crowd scenes,  so some scenes include creatures with only head appliances, wearing skin-tight black outfits in an attempt to hide their costume deficiencies.

In keeping with a frequent practice of B-movie re-release retitling, the phrase "Attack of the" was superimposed on top of the original in the title screen. The production person failed to notice that the original already included "the," producing the redundant Attack of  the The  Eye Creatures. 

==Legacy== television series Jack Purcell athletic shoes!" Crow even pointed out a shot featuring a common monster-movie goof: "The eye creatures   were also unfortunate enough to have evolved with heavy-duty zippers running up their backs." Their riffing produced the fan-favorite phrase "They just didnt care," which was later applied to other movies viewed on the show.
