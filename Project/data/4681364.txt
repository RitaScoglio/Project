When no one on the street will talk to him, he fabricates a story of a pimp thats so well-received it puts his career back on track. But Police and a district attorney think the story is of a real-life pimp who is wanted for murder and start pressuring him to reveal the identity of the subject of his story. Fast Black (Morgan Freeman), the pimp and police suspect, also thinks the story is about himself, and wants to know what Jonathan knows, and who told him.

==Background and reviews==
*This was a long time pet project of Christopher Reeve, but he was having difficulty getting the film financed. When the   film, Reeve agreed to do the film partly because Cannon promised to give Street Smart the financial backing it needed. The film received excellent reviews but performed poorly at the box office, primarily attributed to Cannon Films failure to properly market the theatrical release. 
 Best Supporting Actor for his role, giving his acting career a major boost.

*Miles Davis and Robert Irving III recorded the complete soundtrack.
