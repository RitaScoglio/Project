}} animated science science fiction The Iron Man by Ted Hughes. The film was directed by Brad Bird, scripted by Tim McCanlies, and stars Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., Vin Diesel, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and John Mahoney.

The film is about a lonely boy named Hogarth Hughes raised by his mother (the widow of an Air Force pilot), who discovers an iron giant who fell from space. With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin, they have to stop the Military of the United States|U.S. military and a federal agent named Kent Mansley from finding and destroying the Giant. The Iron Giant takes place in October 1957 in the American state of Maine during the height of the Cold War.

The films development phase began in 1994, though the project took root once Brad Bird signed on as director, and his hiring of Tim McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The script was given approval by Ted Hughes, author of the original novel, and production struggled through difficulties (Bird even enlisted the aid of a group of students from CalArts). The Iron Giant was released by Warner Bros. in the summer of 1999 and received high critical praise. It was nominated for several awards that most notably included the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Nebula Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. However, when it was first released, the film underperformed at the box office, only making $31.3 million worldwide against a budget of around $50 million to $70 million.

==Production==

===Development=== The Iron Man in a mix of stop frame animation and live action directed by Matt Forrest. In 1993, a stage version was mounted at London’s Old Vic. Des McAnuff, who had adapted Tommy (musical)|Tommy with Townshend for the stage, believed that The Iron Man could translate to the screen, and the project was ultimately acquired by Warner Bros. 

In late 1996, while developing the project on its way through, the studio saw the film as a perfect vehicle for Brad Bird, who at the time was working for Turner Feature Animation.  Turner Entertainment had recently merged with Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner, and Bird was allowed to transfer to the Warner Bros. Animation studio to direct The Iron Giant.  After reading the original Iron Man book by Hughes, Bird was impressed with the mythology of the story and in addition, was given an unusual amount of creative control by Warner Bros.  This creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in the original book: Dean and Kent. Birds pitch to Warner Bros. was based around the idea "What if a gun had a soul?"    Bird decided to have the story set to take place in the 1950s as he felt the time period "presented a wholesome surface, yet beneath the wholesome surface was this incredible paranoia. We were all going to die in a freak-out."

The financial failure of Warner Bros. previous animated effort,   or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule," but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as "fully-made by the animation team; I dont think any other studio can say that to the level that we can."

===Writing===
Tim McCanlies was hired to write the script, though Bird was somewhat displeased with having another writer on board, as he himself wanted to write the screenplay.  He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions.  In Birds original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies decided to have a brief scene displaying his survival, stating, "You cant kill E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T. and then not bring him back." McCanlies finished the script within two months, and was surprised once Bird convinced the studio not to use Townshends songs. Townshend did not care either way, saying "Well, whatever, I got paid."  McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the films tight schedule that Warner Bros. "didnt have time to mess with us" as McCanlies said.    Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, "I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He’s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he’s developed The Iron Giant. I can’t stop thinking about it." 

===Animation=== robot characters, but due to Cullens unavailability at the time, Vin Diesel was hired instead.  Cullen did some voice-over work for the films theatrical trailer. Teddy Newton, a storyboard artist, played an important role in shaping the films story. Newtons first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the "hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening."

Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the "Duck and Cover sequence" came to become one of the crew members favorites of the film.    Nicknamed "The X-Factor" by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the films script.   

===Music=== Music in an Animated Feature Production on November 6, 1999.   

==Themes== Duck and Cover, an actual film that offered advice on how to survive if the USSR bombed the USA. The film also has an anti-gun message in it. When the Iron Giant sees a deer get killed by hunters, the Iron Giant notices two rifles discarded by the deers body. The Iron Giants eyes turn red showing hostility to any gun. It is repeated throughout the film, "Guns kill." and "Youre not a gun." Despite the anti-war and anti-gun themes, the film avoids demonizing the military, and presents General Rogard as an essentially rational and sympathetic figure, in contrast to the power-hungry civilian Mansley. Hogarths message to the giant, "You are who you choose to be", played a pivotal role in the film. Writer Tim McCanlies commented that "At a certain point, there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be. And that plays out for the rest of your life."  McCanlies said that movies can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that the movie would "make us feel like were all part of humanity   is something we need to feel."

We showed it to them in April and they said, "Well put it out in a couple of months." Thats a major studio, they have 30 movies a year, and they just throw them off the dock and see if they either sink or swim, because theyve got the next one in right behind it. After they saw the reviews they   were a little shamefaced."

 Warner had known how to release it." 

Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of Warner Bros. at the time, explained, "People always say to me, Why dont you make smarter family movies? The lesson is, Every time you do, you get slaughtered."  Stung by criticism that it mounted an ineffective marketing campaign for its theatrical release, Warner Bros. revamped its advertising strategy for the video release of the film, including tie-ins with Honey Nut Cheerios, AOL and General Motors  and secured the backing of three United States Congress|U.S. congressmen (Ed Markey, Mark Foley and Howard Berman). 

 

===Critical response=== Thanksgiving for 24 hours straight in the early 2000s.   
 Disney animated film". 

Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes.
