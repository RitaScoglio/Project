==Plot==
Trudy Kockenlocker (Betty Hutton) is a small-town girl with a soft spot for soldiers. She wakes up one morning after a wild farewell party for a group of them to find that while drunk the night before, she married a soldier whose name she cant remember, except that "it had a z in it. Like Ratzkiwatzki   or was it Zitzkiwitzki?" She believes they both used fake names and she doesnt know how to get in touch with him or even what he looks like.

The matter is complicated when she learns that she became pregnant that night as well.  Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken), a local Selective_Service_System#Classifications|4-F boy who has been in love with Trudy for years, steps in to help out, but Trudys over-protective father (William Demarest), a policeman, gets involved and complicates matters. Before long, Norval is arrested on 19 different charges, and then he finds himself on the run as an escaped prisoner.

All seems lost until Trudy gives birth to sextuplets. At that point Governor McGinty (Brian Donlevy) and The Boss (Akim Tamiroff) step in and provide a phone call which results in a happy ending for everyone.  Erickson, Hal    

When Norval discovers that Trudy has borne not just one son but six, he faints, and the movie ends with this epilogue on a title card: THE END}}

==Production== Paramount had The Great Moment.  In September 1942, Paramount sold a number of films, such as I Married a Witch, to United Artists, which needed to keep its distribution pipeline filled,  but Sturges was their star filmmaker in this time period, so Miracle... was held back until Paramount had a slot in its schedule to release it. TCM   

There were problems with the censors at the Hays Office over the films subject matter.  In October 1942, after a story conference, the office sent Paramount a seven-page letter outlining their concerns, including remarks made by the character Emmy, who is 14 years old; the potential of the films portraying Trudy as being drunk; and reducing anything to do with Trudys pregnancy.  In short, they wanted the filmmakers to be "extremely careful in handling a subject of this kind because of the delicate nature of the high point of the story", and back off from reiterating the basic facts of the story once they were presented.  In December 1942, they also warned about making any comparisons between Trudys situation and the virgin birth of Jesus.   There were so many objections from the censors that Sturges began production with only ten approved script pages Nixon, Rob & Tatara, Paul   
 War Department also had concerns: they wanted to make sure that the films portrayal of the departing soldiers "should result in giving the audience the feeling that these boys are normal, thoroughly fit American soldiers who have had an evening of clean fun." 

Sturges intent was to "show what happens to young girls who disregard their parents advice and who confuse patriotism with promiscuity", and had included in his script a sermon for the pastor to give, expressing Sturges opinions, but the scene was cut by the studio because the pastor was depicted in too comic a manner. 

The Miracle of Morgans Creek was in production from 21 October to 23 December 1942, with additional scenes shot on 25 February 1943.   Outdoor scenes were shot at the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, California.  

The film had its New York City premiere 5 January 1944 and went into general release on 19 January.   To promote the film, Paramount showed a 20 minute preview on television on 21 March 1944, with stills from the film, narration by Eddie Bracken, and an interview with Diana Lynn.   Paramount was concerned enough about the ending of the film being given away that their press kits included a request to reviewers not to reveal the ending. (Sturges had apparently also withheld the ending from the Hays Office.) 

The film was released on DVD and VHS on 6 September 2005. 

==Reception==
The Miracle of Morgans Creek received praise from the critics.  Bosley Crowther wrote in the New York Times:

 For a more audacious picture&mdash;a more delightfully irreverent one&mdash;than this new lot of nonsense at the Paramount has never come slithering madly down the path. Mr. Sturges...has hauled off this time and tossed a satire which is more cheeky than all the rest....Its hard to imagine how he ever...persuaded the Hays boys that he wasnt trying to undermine all morals.  

Critic James Agee noted that "the Hays office must have been raped in its sleep" to allow the film to be released. 

Although the Hays Office received many letters of protest because of the films subject matter, it was Paramounts highest-grossing film of 1944, playing to standing-room-only audiences in some theatres. 

==Awards and honors== Academy Award Best Original Screenplay for The Miracle of Morgans Creek, the same year that he was also nominated for the same award for Hail the Conquering Hero.  In addition, the National Board of Review nominated the film for Best Picture of 1944, and awarded Betty Hutton the award for Best Acting for her performance in the film.  The New York Times named it as one of the 10 Best Films of 1942-1944.
