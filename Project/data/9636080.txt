The film tells of Daniel (Tomás Fonzi), a coming-of-age seventeen-year-old orphan growing up in a small town in rural Argentina.

Daniel feels trapped in his town.  He has grown tired of living with his grandparents, and hates he his job.  He does, however, enjoy sneaking into the local movie theatre to watch the latest film from porn star Sabrina Love (Cecilia Roth).

Daniel enters a contest where a lucky fellow will win a date with the sexy actress.  The letter he sends earns him the grand prize. Daniel has to get to Buenos Aires for his big moment, but has no money.

Daniel is forced to hitchhike from one side of Argentina to the other, and has a number of interesting experiences along the way.  He encounters a handful of unusual people: his brother (Fabian Vena), who hasnt yet accepted his parents death; a free-thinking writer (Mario Paolucci); and a reporter (Julieta Cardinali) with love on her mind.
