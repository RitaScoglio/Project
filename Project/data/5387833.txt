}} adapted by play of Olivier Award Tony Award for Best Play. It was directed by Nicholas Hytner, who directed the original production at the Royal National Theatre in London, and features the original cast of the play.
 Watford Boys. Locations in Elland and Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax, West Yorkshire are used to create the broader landscape of Sheffield in which the story is set.

==Plot== Oxford or University of Cambridge|Cambridge, taking a seventh-term entrance exam in History. The General Studies teacher, known by staff and boys alike by his nickname "Hector" (Richard Griffiths), is their favourite, and works alongside their deputy head and regular History teacher, Mrs Lintott (Frances de la Tour).
 Samuel Barnett) sings a love song – Rodgers and Harts "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered" – which he pointedly directs towards Dakin (Dominic Cooper). Dakin, who characterises himself as an aspiring lecher, is currently pursuing an affair with the headmasters secretary, Fiona (Georgia Taylor). He is not displeased by Posners attention, but finds himself interested in Irwin. Gradually, Dakins quest to impress Irwin on an intellectual level evolves into a flirtatious, potentially sexual pursuit of his young teacher – who is visibly attracted to Dakin.

Dakin then proceeds to the Headmasters office and, by threatening to reveal Felixs own sexual harassment of Fiona, forces him to reinstate Hector.

The boys prepare to leave the grammar school at the end of that term, and Hector agrees to give Dakin a ride home on the motorbike "for old times sake". However, before they leave, the headmaster runs out and stops them, saying that Hector should not take one of the boys. He suggests that Hector take Irwin instead. Dakin gladly hands the helmet to him, and the screen fades to white as they drive off, the boys waving happily and laughing.

==Reception==
According to Time,  the film is better than the original play, as the transformation to film improved the flow and intimacy of the production, while preserving the messages it seeks to convey. Rolling Stone  notes that some sense of familiarity with the subject of the film is lost in the cutting of nearly an hour from the original play, but the dialogue remains witty and pointed as is the customary style of the author. New York  describes the film as brilliant and infectious, and filled with Alan Bennetts customary deadpan humour. The author writes as though he simultaneously envies the extrovert characters he has created, yet is happy to stand apart from them. Hectors classes ramble, but manage to inspire the boys to the extent that they are pleased to adopt his approach to learning, and contentedly go along with his eccentric behaviour. The film is peppered with literary references and carries an encouragement to engage with life.

==Awards==
The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures named The History Boys one of the Top Ten Films in its 2006 awards.   
 2007 GLAAD GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film – Limited Release.   

Griffiths and de la Tour received BAFTA nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.
