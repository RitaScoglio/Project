== Production ==
The Quiet American started filming in Saigon on January 28, 1957, then moved to Rome, where shooting finished in late April 1958.,   It was the first time a feature film was shot in Vietnam. TCM     The crew had some difficulty filming there — they had to avoid shooting at noon because of the harsh shadows, they had trouble receiving permission to shoot inside a Buddhist temple because of moons phase, and they inadvertently helped a political protest take place that would otherwise have been shut down by the police, because the authorities assumed it had been staged for the film.  Audie Murphy fell ill with appendicitis during a weekend shopping trip to Hong Kong and had to be operated on. 

Humphrey Bogart was reported to have been considered to play the lead role, but it was first offered to Montgomery Clift, with Laurence Olivier to play "Fowler".  When Clift withdrew for reasons of health, he was replaced by Audie Murphy and Olivier then left the project.  Don Graham, No Name on the Bullet: The Biography of Audie Murphy, Penguin, 1989 p 268 

Graham Greene had been a war correspondent in Indochina, and was critical of the growing American involvement there.  By making the character of "Pyle" an aid worker and private citizen and not a representative of the U.S. government, and by focusing on the love triangle aspects of the story instead of the geo-politics of the war, producer-director-writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz significantly diluted the impact of Greenes story,  which led the author to disavow the film.

Phuong is a young Vietnamese woman, but actress Giorgia Moll is Italians|Italian.

Audie Murphy said he never would have done the movie if the tone of the story had not changed from anti-American to pro-American. He said "my part is one of the greatest Ive ever had." 

==Critical response==
The films dilution of Greenes political point was mentioned by some critics, but the acting was nevertheless noted for its high quality, especially of Michael Redgrave.  Also praised were the locations.  Writing in the New York Times,  Bosley Crowther said: "Scenes shot in Saigon have a vivid documentary quality and, indeed, the whole film has an aroma of genuine friction in the seething Orient."
