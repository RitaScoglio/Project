 Old Heidelberg by Wilhelm Meyer-Förster. Ernst Lubitsch directed the picture.  

==Plot==
Young Crown Prince Karl Heinrich (Philippe De Lacy), heir to the kingdom of Karlsburg, is brought to live with his stern uncle, King Karl VII (Gustav von Seyffertitz). The king immediately dismisses the boys nanny (Edythe Chapman) without telling the youngster to avoid an emotional farewell. Fortunately, Dr. Friedrich Jüttner (Jean Hersholt), his new tutor, proves to be sympathetic, and they become lifelong friends. Nonetheless, despite the commoners belief that it must be wonderful to be him, the boy grows up lonely, without playmates his own age.

Upon passing his high school examination in 1901, the young prince (Ramón Novarro) is delighted to learn that both he and Jüttner are being sent to Heidelberg, where he will continue his education. When they arrive, Karls servant is appalled at the rooms provided for the prince and Jüttner at the inn of Ruder (Otis Harlan). When Ruders niece Kathi (Norma Shearer) stoutly defends the centuries-old family business, Karl is entranced by her, and decides to stay. He is quickly made a member of Corps Saxonia, a student society.

Later that day, Karl tries to kiss Kathi, only to learn that she is engaged. Her family approves of her fiance, but she is not so sure about him. She eventually confesses to Karl that, despite the vast social gulf between them, she has fallen in love with him. Karl feels the same about her and swears that he will let nothing separate them. When he takes her boating, their rower, Johann Kellermann, turns his back to them to give them some privacy. Karl jokingly tells him that, when he is king, he will make Kellermann his majordomo.

Then Jüttner receives a letter from the king ordering him to inform Karl that he has selected a princess for him to marry. Jüttner cannot bring himself to destroy his friends happiness. That same day, however, Prime Minister von Haugk (Edward Connelly) arrives with the news that the king is seriously ill, and that Karl must go home and take up the reins of government. When Karl sees his uncle, he is told of the matrimonial plans. While Karl is still reeling from the shock, the old king dies, followed by Jüttner.

Later, von Haugk presses the new monarch about the marriage. The anguished Karl signs the document for the wedding. Then Kellermann shows up to take the job Karl had offered him. When Karl asks him about Kathi, he learns that she is still waiting for him. He goes to see her one last time.

In the last scene, Karl is shown riding through the streets in a carriage with his bride. One onlooker remarks that it must be wonderful to be king, unaware of Karls misery.

==Production== The Merry The Wedding March (1928). Thalberg then tried to attach Ewald André Dupont|E.A. Dupont, and then John S. Robertson to the project, but both passed on it. Soares, André; Beyond paradise: the life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martins Press, New York, 2002; p. 121-122  He settled on thirty-four-year-old German émigré Ernst Lubitsch.

Novarro was cast after John Gilbert was considered. Lubitsch felt that both Novarro and Shearer were miscast,  but was unable to override the studios casting decisions. Soares, André; Beyond paradise: the life of Ramon Novarro; p. 121  Lubitschs insistence on multiple takes and minimal rehearsal time were hard on both leads.  Shearer even complained to Thalberg, her fiance, about Lubitschs penchant for acting out scenes for the actors before they were shot. Thalberg told her that "everyone has a lot to learn from Lubitsch." Eyman, Scott; Ernst Lubitsch: laughter in Paradise; p. 132 

The love scene in the beer garden, which is acclaimed as one of the best scenes in the film by modern critics, was allegedly a headache for the director, who had it reshot entirely, but was still unhappy with it. It was rumored that the love scene in the film was reshot by John M. Stahl, but Lubitschs assistant on the film, Andrew Marton, denied this.  According to director King Vidor, Lubitsch also made Novarro film "a buddy scene with an effeminate extra" Soares, André; Beyond paradise: the life of Ramon Novarro; p. 122  in the hopes of "playing up the charge between them."  Novarro, no doubt, was extremely uncomfortable doing the scene and resentful of being put in that situation by the director; Novarro was extremely guarded about his own homosexuality his entire life.

==Reception==
Though now considered a classic by many film historians, it was far from a unanimous critical success during its original theatrical run. In a review for The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote, "Mr. Novarro is natural and earnest, but he is a little too Latin in appearance for the rôle. Norma Shearer is attractive as Kathi. She, however, does not seem to put her soul into the part. She, too, acts well, but, like Mr. Novarro, she does not respond, as other players have done, to Mr. Lubitschs direction. The ablest acting in this piece of work is done by Jean Hersholt as Dr. Guttner (sic) and Gustav von Seyffertitz as the King. Their efforts in all their scenes reveal their sensitiveness to the direction." 

Despite being a popular film with movie goers, the exorbitant production cost of Student Prince kept it from making a profit; the film lost $307,000.  

==Impact==
Many critics consider it one of Lubitschs finest silent films, and it has received better reviews than MGMs 1954 color remake based on Sigmund Rombergs  operetta version of the story, although the newer version is a sound film and the songs are obviously heard.
