Not of This Earth depicts the dark deeds of an alien intruder who hides under the name of Mr. Johnson. After a nuclear war, the people of his home planet, Davanna, have developed an incurable blood disease. Johnsons mission to Earth is to test the blood of humans for its usefulness in saving his species from extinction. 

==Plot== Paul Birch) has adopted the name Mr. Johnson, conspicuous only for his oversensitive ears and his sunglasses, which he wears even in the dark. The sunglasses hide his blank, white-eyed stare which kills his victims by burning through their eyes and into their brains.
 Morgan Jones), tries to question Rochelle, but the doctor is speechless under Johnsons spell. Johnson kills Rochelle for cautionary reasons, but Nadine, the next person in danger, manages to call the police. Johnson flees in his car, followed closely by Sherbourne on his motorcycle. When Sherbourne runs his siren, Johnson, distracted by the sound, drives the car off the road and dies in the crash.

After Johnsons funeral, Sherbourne and Nadine stand by his grave, which bears the inscription "Here lies a Man who was not of this Earth". While Sherbourne expresses mild compassion for Johnson, whose driving force was the rescue of his planet and its populace, Nadine refuses any kind of pity. They leave the gravesite, but a mysterious man appears at the site.   Like Johnson, he wears the same sunglasses and carries the same distinctive case (which contains transfusion equipment).

==Reception==
Geoff Andrew in his Time Out review, noted that Not of This Earth: "Low budgets give little reason for regret when the often tacky effects are surrounded by so much imagination, good humour, and sheer joy in film-making as here. Not of This Earth is a minor sci-fi gem, with an alien (Birch; you can tell hes an ET by his briefcase and dark glasses, establishing him as infinitely superior to the moronic middle Americans on view) terrorising Earth (or a small backlot) in his quest for blood for the folks back home." 
 The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film called the film, "Cormans most enjoyable science fiction film."  Weldon, Michael. The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film. London: Plexus, 1989. 

The Aurum Film Encyclopedia – Science Fiction said Not of This Earth was "Marvellous." 

In Lexikon des Science Fiction Films, the comment was "  although not necessarily first rank,   still belongs, bearing its low budget in mind, to the best science fiction films of the Fifties." – .
