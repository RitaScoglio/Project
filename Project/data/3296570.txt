==Plot==
NATO operative Jacques Kristoff (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is summoned into action—on his birthday, no less—to track down Galina Konstantin (Laura Harring), who has stolen an extremely valuable and dangerous top-secret cargo.

Finding Galina doesnt take long, and Jacques must wrap up the mission by returning Galina and the contraband to his superiors by train.
 Berlitz correspondence course and a year of acting lessons for Jacquess birthday.

But she sees him off at the train station with the couples teenaged daughter Bailey Kristoff (Jessica Bowman) and son Ethan Kristoff (Kristopher Van Varenberg).

It seems Galinas ill-gotten gain is three vials of SP-43, an ultra-virulent strain of smallpox, cultured in fluorescent green serum.

It also seems that a group of terrorists, led by Mason Cole (Tomas Arana), intend to hijack the train and steal the virus for their own ends. But standing in their way is Jacques.

The virus ends up getting loose in the trains ventilation system. Unfortunately, Jacquess family picked this special moment to surprise him for his birthday by tagging along for the ride.

Jacques becomes a one-man army as he fights to protect his family and the other passengers, and stop Cole and his followers.

Dennis Cakar was announced to play in this movie as Ethan Kristoff, but the scenes were destroyed so they had to change the actor to Kristopher Van Varenberg, the reason was that Dennis Cakar went back to Sweden and the time limit was close to end.
