==Synopsis==
In an unknown place at an unknown time, a swordsman named Grave (Tak Sakaguchi|Sakaguchi) yearns for the ultimate battle. Legend tells of a black coffin kept at the Tougan Temple which has the power to grant any mans deepest desire. Hoping to utilize the coffins ability to fulfill his wish, Grave infiltrates the temple and steals it. Accompanied by a mysterious young girl (Asada), Grave travels across the land towards a desert oasis, a place the tales indicate as being linked to the coffins power.

Contrary to the popular legend, the Tougan monks believe that the coffin holds the Goddess of Destruction, who was banished from Heaven for trying to destroy the world, and whose release will bring about the apocalypse. Fearing the implications of Graves actions, the monks dispatch Ryuen (Takamasa Suga|Suga) to retrieve the coffin and prevent it from being opened. But many other forces are also searching for Grave and his prize, including treasure hunter Sid (Seagal), and an all-out free-for-all ensues as they all struggle to discover the secret power of the coffin.
