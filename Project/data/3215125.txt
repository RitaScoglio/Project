Hobgoblins is a 1988 very low-budget horror comedy (genre)|horror-comedy B-movie indie-movie directed, written, and produced by Rick Sloane, who also served as cinematographer and editor. The film is often seen as a rip-off of "every small monster movie" but mainly "Gremlins"  and earned infamy after it was shown on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". The film is a "Troll 2" like cult classic horror indie-movie about small, often considered cheaply designed and made hobgoblins (Small demon like mythical and goblin-like creatures.) 

==Plot==
The film opens with a security guard named Dennis investigating a deserted film vault at an old movie studio. While inside, his fantasy of being a rock star comes to life, but he dies while performing on stage. His boss, Mr. McCreedy (Jeffrey Culver), closes the door upon discovering the body.
 Army boyfriend Nick (Billy Frank) arrives. Nick and Kevin spar with rakes in a long, protracted, repetitive scene. After Kevin loses horribly, Amy berates him for his weaknesses while Daphne and Nick have sex in Nicks van in the background of the scene.

While in pursuit of a burglar the next evening, Kevin stumbles across the vault, which contains a small group of hairy, demonic little aliens &mdash; the hobgoblins. They escape, leaving Kevin stunned. His boss, the elderly Mr. McCreedy, explains that the hobgoblins crash landed on the studio lot decades earlier, and he has been closely guarding them ever since. The hobgoblins have the hypnotic power to make a persons wildest fantasies come true; however, they also kill their victims in the process when peoples fantasies turn against them.

The hobgoblins go straight to Kevins house, where his friends are partying, as they are attracted by the bright lights. The hobgoblins quickly make their fantasies come true, but with dire consequences. The quiet, prudish Amys fantasy leads her to the sleazy nightclub Club Scum. Kevin and the others follow her there. It turns out that Amys deepest fantasy is to lose her sexual inhibitions and be a stripper. 
 bouncer Roadrash (Duane Whitaker). Although Amy is restored to her original personality, her experience leaves her less sexually repressed than she was before.

Thinking that all the hobgoblins are dead, Kevin, Amy, Kyle, and Daphne return to the lot to report back to Mr. McCreedy. Kevin is confronted by the burglar from earlier that night and beats him in a fight, finally proving his bravery to Amy.  Kevins victory is short lived as the burglar (yet another phantom created by the hobgoblins) pulls a gun from an ankle holster and aims it at Kevin.  Just as the burglar is about to fire, McCreedy shoots the alien, thus saving Kevins life. The remaining hobgoblins run back into the vault, which McCreedy has filled with explosives. The hobgoblins are then blown to pieces.  Amy promises to have sex with Kevin, Nick returns to have sex with Daphne, and Kyle, odd man out, asks to use McCreedys phone, presumably for more phone sex.
