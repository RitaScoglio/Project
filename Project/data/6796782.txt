==Plot==
Jonathan Wamback starts his daily jog through the streets of his suburban neighbourhood. During his run he catches the eye of Courtney Henderson. Shortly after, Jonathan and his best friend Tyler start their first day of high school, where Jonathan notices Courtney again. As the boys are waiting to register, four members of a high school gang, Kyle Simpson, Donald Brooks, Trevor Smith, and Ben Luekens make a noisy entrance. They waste no time ganging up on a small grade nine student, mocking and bullying him. Jonathan steps in to intervene and quickly makes an enemy of gang leader Kyle.

Intrigued by Jonathans moxy, tough girl Courtney leads him away, both delighting Jon and angering Kyle. Returning home from a workout, Lozanne Wamback, Jonathans mom, encounters the gang members lighting cherry bombs in the park and harassing some small children. Angered she follows Kyle home and attempts to speak to his mother about his behaviour. But Nora Simpson refuses to believe Lozanne and brushes her off. Lozanne tells Joe and Jon about the incident, but Joe is too busy to listen and dismisses her concerns, saying shes taking it too seriously.

Lozanne and Joe establish a routine of daily care - participating in his physical therapy, washing and tending his broken body, talking to him even though he doesnt appear to hear. Their love for Jonathan and complete dedication to helping him recuperate slowly starts to heal their fragile relationship. As Jon slowly starts to emerge from his coma, Joe lobbies to have the Young Offenders Act rewritten to impose harsher penalties for violent crime.

Gord finally visits Jon for the first time since the attack and the truth emerges that he wrote the slur that was used as the excuse for the beating. Finally, Jon decides to return to school to prove that despite everything, hes no longer a victim. Upon his arrival Kyle and other students are shocked at the reality of the physical damage inflicted upon Jon.
