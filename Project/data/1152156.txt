}} fantasy comedy-drama philandering husband.    The film uses "caricatural types and dream situations to represent a psychic landscape."  It was Fellinis first feature-length color film, but followed his use of color in The Temptation of Doctor Antonio in the portmanteau film Boccaccio 70 (1962). Juliet of the Spirits won a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1966.
