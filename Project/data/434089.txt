==Plot summary== Senator Ransom Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher.
 flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney.  His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing old ladies of their heirlooms, he is brutally beaten.  In town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbones townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him.

When Stoddard, the naive "pilgrim" (as Doniphon dubs him), opens a law practice in town, Doniphon and many others believe him crazy for inviting retribution from Valance, who cannot abide any challenge to his "authority".  Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun.  Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force.  He earns the towns respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeople â€” including Hallie.

When Dutton Peabody (Edmond OBrien), publisher of the local newspaper, offers him a revolver, however, he accepts it; and when Doniphon sees that he is trying to teach himself to use it, he brings Stoddard to his house for a shooting lesson. During target practice he shoots a hole in a paint can, splattering paint on Stoddards suit, explaining that this is the sort of trickery that he can expect from Valance.  Infuriated, Stoddard punches him in the jaw and leaves.

Shinbones residents meet to elect two delegates for a statehood convention at the territorial capital.  Doniphon nominates Stoddard for one of the positions, because he "knows the law, and throws a mean punch".  Stoddard addresses the group, explaining that statehood will benefit the people of the territory through improvements in infrastructure, safety, and education.  The areas cattle barons, who oppose statehood and the new regulations that it would bring, hire Valance to sabotage the effort.  He interrupts the meeting and attempts to bully the townspeople into electing him as a delegate, but Stoddard defies him yet again.  The townspeople elect Stoddard and Peabody, prompting Valance to challenge Stoddard to a gunfight.  Doniphon again advises Stoddard to leave town, but Stoddard maintains that he still believes in the rule of law (even though Link will do nothing to help him), and he is willing to risk his life for his principles.

That evening, after Valance and his gang (Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin) assault Peabody and trash his newspaper office, Stoddard goes into the street to face Valance.  Valance toys with Stoddard, shooting a pottery vase near his head, and then his right arm, knocking his gun to the ground. He condescendingly allows Stoddard to retrieve his gun.  The next bullet, he says, will be "right between the eyes"; but Stoddard fires first, and to everyones shock, Valance falls dead.  Doniphon watches Hallie as she lovingly cares for Stoddards wounds, then heads for the saloon to drown his sorrows.  At his homestead, in a drunken rage, he sets fire to the addition that he has just finished in anticipation of asking Hallie to marry him.  His ranch hand, Pompey (Woody Strode), rescues him from the inferno, but the house is destroyed.

At the statehood convention, Peabody nominates Stoddard as the territorys delegate to Washington, but his "unstatesmanlike" conduct is challenged by a rival candidate.  Stoddard decides that his opponent is right; he cannot be entrusted with public service after killing a man in a gunfight.  Seeing Stoddards reluctance, Doniphon takes him aside and confides that he, Doniphon, actually killed Valance from an alley across the street, firing at the same time as Stoddard. Doniphon explains that he knows Hallie loves Stoddard; he shot Valance to secure her happiness.  Reinspired, Stoddard returns to the convention, accepts the nomination, and is elected to the Washington delegation.

The flashback ends, and Stoddard fills in the intervening years: He married Hallie, and then, on the strength of his reputation as "the man who shot Liberty Valance", became the first Governor of the newly minted state.  He then served as U.S. Senator and Ambassador to Great Britain before returning to the Senate, and now hes the odds-on favorite to become his partys nominee for Vice President.  Newspaper editor Scott now knows the truth about Valances death; but after reflection, he throws his interview notes into the fire.  "This is the West, sir," he explains.  "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."  On the train back to Washington, Stoddard informs Hallie, to her delight, that he has decided to retire from politics and practice law in Shinbone.  When Stoddard tells the train conductor (Willis Bouchey) that he will write to railroad officials, thanking them for their many courtesies in expediting his trip back to Washington, the conductor replies, "Nothings too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance!"

 Brackettville and we would have had color stock.  Ford had to accept those terms or not make the film." 
 football player", USC had been curtailed by injuries.) He also ridiculed Wayne for failing to enlist during World War II, during which Ford filmed a series of widely praised combat documentaries for the Office of Strategic Services, and was wounded at the Battle of Midway,  and Stewart served with distinction as a bomber pilot. "How rich did you get while Jimmy was risking his life?" he demanded.  Waynes avoidance of wartime service was a major source of guilt for him in his later years. 

Stewart related that midway through filming, Wayne asked him why he, Stewart, never seemed to be the target of Fords venomous remarks.  Other cast- and crew-members also noticed Stewarts apparent immunity from Fords abuse. Then, toward the end of filming, Ford asked Stewart what he thought of Strodes costume for the films beginning and end, when the actors were playing their parts 25 years older. Stewart replied, "It looks a bit Uncle Remussy to me." Ford responded, "Whats wrong with Uncle Remus?"  He called for the crews attention and announced, "One of our players doesnt like Woodys costume. Now, I dont know if Mr. Stewart has a prejudice against Negroes, but I just wanted you all to know about it." Stewart said he "wanted to crawl into a mouse hole"; but Wayne told him, "Well, welcome to the club. Im glad you made it."  

Fords behavior "...really pissed Wayne off," Strode said, "but he would never take it out on Ford," the man largely responsible for his rise to stardom.  "He ended up taking it out on me."  While filming an exterior shot on a horse-drawn cart, Wayne almost lost control of the horses, and knocked Strode away when he attempted to help. When the horses did stop, Wayne tried to pick a fight with the younger and fitter Strode; Ford called out, "Dont hit him, Woody, we need him."  Wayne later told Strode, "We gotta work together. We both gotta be professionals."  Strode blamed Ford for nearly all the friction on the set.  "What a miserable film to make," he added. 

==Music== Alfred Newmans "Ann Rutledge Theme", from Young Mr. Lincoln.  He told Peter Bogdanovich that he used the theme in both films to evoke repressed desire and lost love.   The film scholar Kathryn Kalinak notes that Ann Rutledges theme "encodes longing" and "fleshes out the failed love affair between Hallie and Tom Doniphon, the growing love between Hallie and Ranse Stoddard, and the traumatic loss experienced by Hallie over her choice of one over the other, none of which is clearly articulated by dialogue." 
 Jimmie Rodgers Snoopy vs. the Red Baron. It was also covered by the Australian rock band Regurgitator on its 1998 David/Bacharach tribute album To Hal and Bacharach. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.   

==Reception== 16th highest Academy Award The Searchers and The Shootist as one of Waynes best westerns. 

Roger Ebert wrote that each of the ten Ford/Wayne westerns is "... complete and self-contained in a way that approaches perfection", and singled out Liberty Valance as "the most pensive and thoughtful" of the group.   Director Sergio Leone (Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) listed Ford as a major influence on his work, and Liberty Valance as his favorite Ford film. "It was the only film," he said, "where   learned about something called pessimism." 

In a retrospective analysis, the New York Times called Liberty Valance "...one of the great Western classics," because "it questions the role of myth in forging the legends of the West, while setting this theme in the elegiac atmosphere of the West itself, set off by the aging Stewart and Wayne."   The New Yorkers Richard Brody described it as "the greatest American political movie", because of its depictions of a free press, town meetings, statehood debates, and the "civilizing influence" of education in frontier America.

==Billing== top billing over Wayne in the films promotional posters, but in the film itself Waynes screen card appears first, followed by Stewarts. In addition, the studio specified that Waynes name appear before Stewarts on theatre marquees,  reportedly at Fords request.  "Wayne actually played the lead," he told Peter Bogdanovich.  "Jimmy Stewart had most of the scenes, but Wayne was the central character, the motivation for the whole thing."
