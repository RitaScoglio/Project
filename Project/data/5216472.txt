Claires Knee ( )  is a 1970 French drama film directed by Éric Rohmer. It is the fifth movie in the series of the Six Moral Tales.

==Plot==
The story happens between 29 June and 29 July, presumably in 1970. (Inter-title cards of the dates are displayed before the daily events are shown.)

While holidaying at Lake Annecy on the eve of his wedding, career diplomat Jerôme accidentally meets up with Aurora, an old personal friend. Through Aurora, he meets Auroras landlady, Madame Walter, and Laura, Madame Walters youngest teenage daughter. Observant Aurora detects Lauras crush on Jerôme, and advises Jerôme of such. After Jerôme and Laura take a hike in the mountains together, she confesses that she is "a little in love of" Jerôme.

Days later (on 8 July), Lauras attractive older half-sister Claire arrives.  Upon seeing Claires knee on a ladder, he finds himself longing to touch her knee. However, Jerôme controls his temptation. Eventually an opportunity presents itself during a boat trip on the lake when Jerôme and Claire have to seek shelter in a hut from an approaching storm. Jerôme tells Claire that he saw her boyfriend, Gilles, together with another girl. When Claire starts to cry Jerôme consoles her by placing his hand upon Claires knee.

== Accolades== Prix Méliès and the Grand Prix at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. Ruadhán Mac Cormaic (2010-01-11). "Film-maker Rohmer dies in Paris". The Irish Times. Retrieved February 22, 2015  It was named Best Film by the National Society of Film Critics and Best Foreign Film by the National Board of Review. It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globe Awards.

It was a huge international success. Vincent Canby called it "something close to a perfect film." John Wakeman, World Film Directors, Volume 2, 1945-1985. New York: H. W. Wilson, 1988. pp. 919-928.  Cecile Mury of Télérama said "This camera outdoors gives the appearance of a small story where it goes nothing. Yet these fragments of a love speech make up a special study of desire, verbal pleasure, almost literary, which accompanies every inclination. A jewel."

==Style==

It was Rohmers second film shot in color, with Rohmer explaining "the presence of the lake and the mountains is stronger in color than in black and white. It is a film I couldnt imagine in black and white. The color green seems to me essential in that film...This film would have no value to me in black and white."
