Writing for Variety (magazine)|Variety, Emanuel Levy gave the film a mixed review. He praised the directors ideas and characters, as well as his sensitivity to the issues faced by young Americans. He drew comparisons between the film and Woody Allens early films ("in spirit and ambition, if not in execution"). He enjoyed DuValls performance, although said it was "occasionally too intensely mannered", and praised the rest of the cast. However, Levy also described the film as uneven, with a "messy structure and lack of discipline".
