Betty Boop and Grampy is a 1935 Fleischer Studios animated short film starring Betty Boop, and featuring Grampy in his first appearance.

==Plot==

Betty receives an invitation to a party from her elderly relative, Grampy. As she strolls along singing "Im On My Way to Grampys", she is joined by two moving men, a fireman and a traffic cop&mdash;all who irresponsibly drop everything (including a piano, a burning house and a traffic jam) to go to Grampys party.

Grampy is an eccentric inventor, whose labor-saving devices are of the Rube Goldberg variety.  For example, he has a device that moves his entire house to the front entrance whenever the doorbell is rung. The glass shade of his ceiling light is rigged to double as a punch bowl and he has modified an old umbrella to slice a cake into wedges.

Grampy entertains his guests by building self-playing musical instruments out of household gadgets (which then play "Hold That Tiger").  Everyone dances until they drop from exhaustion, the exception being the exuberant Grampy.
