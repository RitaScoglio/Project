In April 1943, Władysław can see from a window of his hiding place the effects of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Attempting to leave the hiding place for assistance, a neighbor questions his being in the building. Władysław flees and is again assisted with a new hiding place with a piano that on he can silently mimic play. He gets jaundice and survives.
 Polish resistance attacks a German building across the street from Władysławs hideout. A tank shells his apartment building, forcing him to hide elsewhere in a deserted and war-torn section of the city. He stays in an damaged and abandoned house, where he finds a large can of pickles. He thinks he is alone in the house and tries to open the can. A Wehrmacht officer, Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann), has gone to the house to play on the piano there. The officer learns about Władysławs ability when he is told by the officer to play anything; he plays Ballade in G minor (Chopin)|Chopins Ballade in G minor. Hosenfeld is moved and has Władysław show him where he hides in the attic. The German officer brings him food.

In Spring 1945, former inmates of a Nazi concentration camp pass a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured German soldiers and verbally abuse them. Hosenfeld, among those captured, overhears a released inmate lament over his former career as a violinist. He asks the violinist if he knows Szpilman, which he confirms. Hosenfeld wishes for Szpilman to return the favor and help release him. Sometime later, the violinist is able to bring Szpilman back to the site but they find it has been long abandoned.

==Production== end of World War II.

Joseph Fiennes was Polanskis first choice for the lead role, but he turned it down due to a previous commitment to a theatrical role. Over 1,400 actors auditioned for the role of Szpilman at a casting call in London. Unsatisfied with all who tried, Polanski sought to cast Adrien Brody, whom he saw as ideal for the role during their first meeting in Paris.

Principal photography on The Pianist began on 9 February 2001 in Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, Germany. The Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding city were recreated on the backlot of Babelsberg Studio as they would have looked during the war. Old Soviet Army barracks were used to create the ruined city, as they were going to be destroyed anyway.

The first scenes of the film were shot at the old army barracks. Soon after, the film crew moved to a villa in Potsdam, which served as the house where Szpilman meets Hosenfeld. On 2 March 2001, filming then moved to an abandoned Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, Germany. The scenes that featured German soldiers destroying a Warsaw hospital with flamethrowers were filmed here. On 15 March, filming finally moved to Babelsberg Studios. The first scene shot at the studio was the complex and technically demanding scene in which Szpilman witnesses the ghetto uprising.

Principal photography ended in July 2001 and was followed by months of post-production in Paris, France.

==Reception==
The Pianist received high critical acclaim and Brodys performance received extreme praise.   It has a 96% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 178 reviews with an average rating of 8.2/10 and the consensus, "Well-acted and dramatically moving, The Pianist is Polanskis best work in years."  Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, gave the film a score of 85/100, based on 40 reviews from critics. 

  said that the film "is the best dramatic feature Ive seen on the Holocaust experience, so powerful a statement on war, inhumanity and arts redemption that it may signal Polanskis artistic redemption." He would later go on to say that the film "illustrates that theme and proves that Polanskis own art has survived the chaos of his life -- and the hell that war and bigotry once made of it."    Richard Schickel of Time (magazine)|Time called it a "raw, unblinkable film" and said that "We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears, our sympathies."    Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the film "contains moments of irony, of ambiguity and of strange beauty, as when we finally get a look at Warsaw and see a panorama of destruction, a world of color bombed into black-and-white devastation." He also said that "In the course of showing us a struggle for survival, in all its animal simplicity, Polanski also gives us humanity, in all its complexity."    A.O. Scott of The New York Times said that Szpilman "comes to resemble one of Samuel Becketts gaunt existential clowns, shambling through a barren, bombed-out landscape clutching a jar of pickles. He is like the walking punchline to a cosmic jest of unfathomable cruelty." He also felt that "Szpilmans encounter, in the wars last days, with a music-loving Nazi officer... ...courted sentimentality by associating the love of art with moral decency, an equation the Nazis themselves, steeped in Beethoven and Wagner, definitively refuted."   

==Home release==
The Pianist was released on DVD on 26 May 2003 in a double-sided disc Special Edition DVD, with the film on one side and special features on the other. Some Bonus Material included a making-of, interviews with Brody, Polanski, and Harwood, and clips of Szpilman playing the piano. The Polish DVD edition included an audio commentary track by production designer Starski and director of photography Edelman.

Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the film on HD-DVD on 8 January 2008 with extras comprising the featurette "A Story of Survival" and rare footage of the real Władysław Szpilman playing his piano, as well as additional interviews with Adrien Brody and other crew.
 Optimum Home European market Optimum later rectified this  but the initial release also lacked notable special features. The StudioCanal Collection version includes an extensive Behind the Scenes look as well as several interviews with the makers of the film and Szpilmans relatives. 

==Music==
  Nocturne in C-sharp minor Lento con gran espressione, Op. posth.
* The piano piece that is heard being played by a next door neighbour while Szpilman was in hiding at an apartment is also an arrangement of Umowilem sie z nia na dziewiata. Piano Sonata No. 14 (Moonlight Sonata) by Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven. It would later be revealed that German officer Hosenfeld was the pianist. The German composition juxtaposed with the mainly Polish/Chopin selection of Szpilman. Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23, but the version played in the movie was shortened (the entire piece lasts about 10 minutes). Cello Suite No. 1. Grande Polonaise brillante, Op. 22.
* Shots of Szpilmans hands playing the piano in close-up were performed by Polish classical pianist Janusz Olejniczak (b. 1952), who also performed on the soundtrack.
* Since Polanski wanted the film to be as realistic as possible, any scene showing Brody playing was actually his playing overdubbed by recordings performed by Janusz Olejniczak. In order for Brodys playing to look like it was at the level of Władysław Szpilmans, he spent many months prior to and during the filming practicing so that his keystrokes on the piano would convince viewers that Brody himself was playing.
