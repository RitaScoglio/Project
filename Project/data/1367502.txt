==Plot==
In 1976, in South Africa during Apartheid, Ben Du Toit (Donald Sutherland) is a South African school teacher.

At Bens school, Gordon Ngubene (Winston Ntshona), a black man, seeks his help while investigating the death of his son during the Soweto Riots.  Like many South African whites, Ben refuses to get involved in the racial divides that have been tearing the country apart, thinking that Gordons claims against the white minority government are unfounded.  Things change when Ben sees firsthand the brutality by his own race against blacks, particularly when he sees the dead body of Gordon at the morgue not long after being tortured at the hands of the secret, corrupt government police.  Later, Gordons wife, Emily, is also killed under suspicious circumstances.

Upset by this turn of events, Ben retains Ian McKenzie (Marlon Brando), a human rights attorney, to assist him with the case.  Bens political awakening is so complete by this time that his crusade to bring those responsible for the deaths of Gordon and his family members eventually take their toll on his own family.  Eventually, Ben pays the ultimate price for standing up to a corrupt government for basic human rights and equality.

Director Euzhan Palcy was so passionate about creating an accurate portrayal on film that she traveled to Soweto undercover, posing as a recording artist, to research the riots.  Actor Brando was so moved by Palcys commitment to social change that he came out of a self-imposed retirement to play the role of the human rights lawyer; he also agreed to work for union scale ($4,000), far below his usual fee. The salaries of Sutherland and Sarandon were also reduced and the film was budgeted at only $9 million. Collins, Glenn.   The New York Times (Sept. 25, 1989). 

The film was shot at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, England and on location in Zimbabwe.

Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert called A Dry White Season "an effective, emotional, angry, subtle movie."  The Washington Post  s Rita Kempley wrote that "A Dry White Season is political cinema so deeply felt it attains a moral grace.

And Rolling Stones Peter Travers wrote that director Palcy, "a remarkable talent, has kept her undeniably powerful film ablaze with ferocity and feeling."
