==Background==
 Gloria Romero as a spirited, cigar-chomping country girl who rolls tobacco leaves into cigars for a living. Romero is a wonderful comedienne, combining as she does a stately beauty and aristocratic nose with eyes that slant just (and maddeningly) so, plus a sense of humor game enough to undercut her impeccable poise; Dolphy does well in a supporting role as comic sidekick with an insatiable appetite. The film, set in the tobacco-growing lands of the Ilocos region, is also a lengthy advertisement on the many pleasures of smoking, with seemingly everyone onscreen from the loftiest haciendero to the lowliest tobacco roller casually lighting up fearsome-looking cigars made from uncut tobacco leaf; one character actually suffers asthma attacks if he cant get his regular nicotine fix, from the tightly rolled cigars that only Romero knows how to make.
