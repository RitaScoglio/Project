Pehla Pehla Pyaar (  which was released across theaters in Pakistan in January 2006.

==Plot==
Zimmy (Ali Tabish) and Tina (Resham) belong to middle-class families; live and study in Dubai, and fall in love after initial indecisiveness. Zimmy becomes a famous singer thanks to Tina who appears in his first music video as a friendly-cum-romantic gesture. Seth Tahir Dawood (Nadeem Baig|Nadeem) in Bangkok catches a glimpse of Tina on TV and asks his personal secretary, played by Kanwal, to arrange his meeting with her. The secretary is helped by Sweetie (Sajid Hasan), Tinas brother - a drunkard and a gambler - who manages to convince her mother that the 40-something Seth is the perfect match for Tina. Zimmy returns from an outdoor shoot to learn of the marriage and heartbroken, vows never to get married. But unknown to him, he is admired by Haya (Zara Sheikh), the daughter of Seth Dawood and Tinas step daughter.

The film moves at an amazingly rapid pace in the latter half, but sadly in no particular direction. People die as if there is they have some kind of death wish, and the abrupt conclusion confirms that the director, for reasons better known to him, was in a rush to wrap things up.

==Critics==
The film was the most expensive but also amongst the biggest flop of the 2006 despite the high hopes of this film, it was said to be the Pehla Pehla Pyar’ Lollywood’s saving grace, but not quite when it released

The good thing about ‘Pehla Pehla Pyar’ is that there is no slapstick comedy, cheap thrills or exaggerated action sequences. Of course, the masala and glamour is all there but with refined taste
and the visuals are not only a delight to watch due to their splendour but are extremely enthralling far as the choice of locations and choreography is concerned. The camera work is exceptionally captivating.

The songs that are all very romantic and soft have beautiful melodies and rich arrangements. They are supported by simple and very catchy lyrics.

Debutante Ali Tabish is all excited and geared up.  
I was given a big responsibility,” he says, “as mine was a lead role opposite veteran actors. I had to put in my best effort. To shine among such big names stars is easier said than done but I knew Pehla Pehla Pyar was the opportunity of a lifetime. I’m sure no one will be disappointed after seeing the film.” Judging Ali Tabish by his looks alone, one can assume at this point that Lollywood has a new ‘chocolate hero.
