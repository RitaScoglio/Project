==Summary==

Madhav Shastri aka Maddy is a notorious good for nothing in his college. Among other things, he has no soft corner for girls in his heart. Years later, however, Madhav meets Reena Malhotra and inexplicably falls in love with her. On learning that she is going to be engaged to Rajiv Samra, a childhood friend who is an NRI (non-resident Indian), Madhav decides to impersonate Rajiv. However, when the real Rajiv shows up, Maddys punishment turns out to be far greater than his crime.

==Plot==

The story starts with narration by Maddy (R. Madhavan) himself. Maddy is the son of a music shop owner (Anupam Kher) who hopes that Maddy will someday take over his shop. Instead, Maddy is a total brat, not serious about studies and notorious in his college. He harasses the girls in his college. In contrast to him is his arch rival Sam (Saif Ali Khan), a model student, with whom Maddy is at constant loggerheads. The enmity goes so far that Maddy even tries to frame Sam. Sam challenged Maddy for one-on-one fight, to which Maddy happily agreed. But the fight was interrupted in between by the professors. Later at Sams graduation party, Maddy again tries to challenge Sam, but this time, Sam denies. Sam graduates and leaves the college, but promises Maddy that one fine day, he will complete what was started (i.e., the fight).

Two years later, Maddy has taken a job as software instructor at a private company. His attitude has mellowed a lot, but not changed. He and his college cronies attend a wedding of another classmate, where Maddy spots Reena (Diya Mirza). Maddy is smitten and tries to learn more about her, but in vain. However, destiny makes them meet again. Soon he learns that Reena plans to marry Rajeev Samra, an old friend who is now an NRI. Maddy also learns that Reena doesnt know how Rajeev looks like now.

On persuasion of his friends and specifically by his father (aka DD), Maddy decides to pretend to be Rajeev. Reena, who previously liked him only as a friend, falls in love with him too. Everything goes well until Rajeevs parents call and tell them that the real Rajeev is coming to meet them. On learning this, everyone is shocked and Maddys secret is revealed. Reena decides to call off her relationship with Maddy. The real Rajeev also decides to meet his impostor.

Maddy is shocked to see that Rajeev is none other than Sam. Sam is even more infuriated to learn his impostors true identity. Rajeev and Reenas parents decide to get them married as soon as possible. Here, Maddy goes into depression and starts drinking. Reena is no better off without him either, as she finds it very difficult to forget him. Though the enmity between Sam and Maddy is renewed, Sam cannot help but notice that Reena is marrying him only because she is mad at Maddy.

Finally, Rajeev confronts Reena and asks her whether she loves him or Maddy. In the meantime, Maddy decides to go to San Francisco, California, taking an offer made to him by his current employer, which initially he had declined. When Rajeev realizes that Reena still loves Maddy, he takes her to the airport. Rajeev and Maddy spot each other. Maddy thinks that Rajeev has come to rebuke him once more. Rajeev hands Reena over to Maddy, upon which the duo confess their feelings for each other. Rajeev is heartbroken, but feigns his old attitude towards Maddy saying that "we can never be friends" and leaves them.

==Production==
The success of the Tamil film Minnale led to producer Vashu Bhagnani signing Gautham Menon on to direct the Hindi language remake of the film, Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein, which also featured Madhavan with Diya Mirza and Saif Ali Khan added to the film. Menon was initially apprehensive but said it took "half an hour" to agree and against his intentions, the producer opted against retaining the technical crew of the original.  He changed a few elements, deleted certain scenes and added some more for the version.
However in comparison, the film gained poor reviews with a critic citing that "the presentation is not absorbing" though stating that the director " handled certain sequences with aplomb"; the film subsequently went on to become a below average grosser at the box office.  The failure of the film left him disappointed, with Menon claiming in hindsight that the film lacked the simplicity of the original with the producers intervention affecting proceedings.    In 2011, the producer of the film approached him to remake the film with the producers son Jackky Bhagnani in the lead role, but Menon was uninterested with the offer.
