The film was shot on location in San Francisco, California, and is noted for its accurate depiction of the vibrant fruit and produce market in that city (and the use of extras who worked at the market). The film was released on DVD as part of the Criterion Collection in 2005.

The outdoor Fruit Market scenes were shot in the Oakland Produce Market area on 3rd street. Several indoor and street shots are also were made in that locale. The story discusss SF and does feature SF but majority of scenes were in the actual Produce Market in Oakland (now the Warehouse district).
