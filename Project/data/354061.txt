}} buddy cop Walter Hill. narc Ivan James Belushi, Soviet Georgian drug kingpin, Viktor Rostavili (Ed ORoss), who also happens to be the killer of Dankos previous partner back in Soviet Russia.
 Russian speakers because of the movies weak portrayal of the Russian language and stereotypes.

==Synopsis== Moscow Police Georgian drug kingpin and crime lord. The ambush severely backfires; Viktor flees the Soviet Union and comes to the USA, after gunning down several other Moscow cops, including Dankos partner.

Loudmouthed Chicago Police Department Detective-Sergeant Art Ridzik, investigates several local murders committed by Viktors cartel. When Viktor is arrested in Chicago, Danko is dispatched to escort him back to Moscow to face justice in the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, Danko and Ridzik find themselves partnered together when Viktor escapes custody, gunning down Ridziks partner in the process. Danko is frustrated when his lack of a diplomatic license prohibits him from carrying a weapon. He shares his candid observations with Ridzik: "This Chicago is very strange city. Your crime is organized, but your police is not."

Danko and Ridzik pursue Viktor and his henchmen around Chicago. Finally, Danko and Viktor commandeer a couple of Greyhound buses, then engage in a high-speed chase, smashing up half of Chicago in the process, with no sign of the cops...until Viktor is side-slammed by a train. He takes on Danko in a running, Texas-style shootout (Danko uses a Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum given to him by Ridzik); Viktor is gunned down. Danko returns to Moscow after exchanging wristwatches with Ridzik as an act of goodwill.

==Production==
Walter Hill says he conceived of the idea for Red Heat because he and Arnold Schwarzenegger had long wanted to work together:
 I didnt want to do sci-fi and its tough to use Arnold credibly in an American context with his accent. I thought it would be interesting if he could play a Russian cop in the US. I wanted to do a traditional John Wayne/Clint Eastwood larger-than-life movie. You then ask the question: Will the American audience accept an unapologetic Soviet hero, someone who will not defect at the end of the movie? Director Hill puts extra dimension in Hollywood themes
Thompson, Anne. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current file)   17 June 1988: GL.  
Hill says he deliberately chose to tone down the Schwarzenegger persona, making him more realistic and less prone to wisecracks. Hill:
 I had confidence in him as an actor. I didnt want him just to throw a Volkswagon over a building. Arnold has an ability to communicate that cuts through cultures and countries. They just love to see this guy win. But everyone thinks its his muscles. Its not that at all: its his face, his eyes. He has a face thats a throwback to a warrior from the Middle Ages, or ancient Greece.  
The music score was done by James Horner. "I told James I wanted something like youre in the Olympics and youve just won a gold medal," said Hill. "I wanted something heroic." Action man with an eye for character
Dwyer, Michael. The Irish Times (1921-Current File)   13 Jan 1989: 14. 

Hill says he wanted to use buses rather than cars in the climactic action scene because it would be more interesting. "Also, I thought it was very appropriate for Arnold. He doesnt fit well in cars." 

He described the film as "in an odd way its a traditional love story between these two guys.
