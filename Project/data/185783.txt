Time Indefinite is an autobiographical 1993 documentary film directed by Ross McElwee and exploring themes of grief, mortality, and the convenient disconnection of watching life through a camera lens.

The title comes from a passage from the Bible mentioned by a visiting Jehovahs Witness. McElwee is filming the interaction and focused on adjusting the exposure to try to catch the play of light over the mans face; distracted, he "hears" the phrase about 30 seconds after the man says it and understands it to refer to the unpredictable imminence of death.

==Plot==

In the film, director Ross McElwee gets married, finally putting an end to his familys worrying; his grandmother dies; his wife Marilyn has a miscarriage; and his father, a medical doctor, dies suddenly within a week of McElwees wifes miscarriage. His mother had died of cancer ten years earlier and so McElwee returns to his fathers house, where his fathers housekeeper ministers to him about Christianity and faith.
 cremated remains in a bag inside a box and tries to get rid of them but cant bring herself to do it.

McElwees brother is a successful doctor; on a visit to his brothers practice, Ross talks with his brother about their fathers death, which took them both by surprise. Rosss brother receives a patient who has a large malignant tumor on her breast; the woman has had the tumor for years without seeking medical help. Rosss brother takes a slide of the tumor for his files; it has spread across much of her chest and is both multifaceted and multicolored. Ross incorporates his brothers interview with the woman—and the slide his brother takes—into his film, musing in voiceover about motivation and fatality and marvelling at the power of denial.

Eventually Ross abandons the film, only to continue it later: his wife is pregnant. The pregnancy comes to term and Ross and Marilyn go with their baby son to visit Charleen, who criticizes them for bringing children into such a hostile and unpredictable world but speaks to the passion that drives life and procreation. Ross and Marilyn dote on their son and seem largely unbothered by the criticism.
