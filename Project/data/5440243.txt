==Plot==
The film opens up with a company of French Foreign Legionaries approaching a fort. From a distance it is perceived to be occupied, but upon closer inspection the bodies representing are found to be dead, only mounted for deception. However, a lone shot is fired from inside and two people investigate. One goes missing and the other finds a death note on one of the bodies admitting to the stealing of a valuable sapphire called the "Blue Water".
 Robert Preston) and John (Ray Milland), her ward Isobel Rivers (Susan Hayward), and estate heir Augustus Brandon are introduced. Almost fifteen years pass showing them grown up. They learn that Sir Hector Brandon intends to sell the "Blue Water," leaving nothing left for the estate, the children and Lady Brandon. At Beaus request, the gem is brought out for one last look when suddenly the lights go out and the jewel disappears. All present proclaim their innocence, but first Beau and then Digby depart without warning, each leaving a confession that he committed the robbery. John reluctantly parts from his beloved Isobel and goes after his brothers.
 
John discovers they have joined the French Foreign Legion, so he enlists as well. They are trained by the sadistic Sergeant Markoff (Brian Donlevy). Markoff finds out about the theft from his informant Rasinoff (J. Carrol Naish), who overhears joking remarks by the Geste brothers. Rasinoff convinces Markoff that Beau is hiding the gem.
 
Markoff arranges to split the brothers. Beau and John are part of a detachment sent to man isolated Fort Zinderneuf. When Lieutenant Martin dies from a fever, Markoff assumes command. Fearing the sergeants now-unchecked brutality, Schwartz (Albert Dekker) incites the other men to mutiny the next morning; only Beau, John, and Maris (Stanley Andrews) refuse to take part. However, Markoff is tipped off by Voison (Harold Huber) and disarms the men while they are sleeping.
 
The next morning, Markoff orders Beau and John to execute the ringleaders, but they refuse. Before Markoff can do anything, the fort is attacked by Tuareg people|Tuaregs. The initial assault is beaten off, but after each new attack, there are fewer defenders. Markoff props up the corpses at their posts to make it look as if there are still plenty of soldiers left. The final attack is repulsed, but Beau is shot, leaving Markoff and John the only men left standing.
 
Markoff sends John to get bread and wine. He searches Beaus body and finds a small pouch and two letters. When John sees what Markoff has done, he draws his bayonet, giving Markoff the perfect excuse to shoot the only witness to his theft. However, Beau is not yet dead and manages to spoil Markoffs aim, allowing John to stab him. John and Beau hear a bugle announcing the arrival of reinforcements, Digby among them.  Beau expires in his brothers arms after telling him to take one of the letters to Lady Brandon and leave the other, a confession of the robbery, in Markoffs hands. John sneaks away unseen.
 
Digby volunteers to find out why there is no response from the fort. He discovers Beaus body and, remembering his oft-expressed wish, gives him a Viking funeral. He places Beau on a cot, with a dog (Markoff) at his feet, and sets fire to the barracks. Then he too deserts.
  Charles Barton) desert, and together, they begin the long journey home. Desperate for water, they find an oasis, but it is occupied by a large band of natives. Digby tricks them into fleeing by playing a bugle to signal a charge by non-existent Legionnaires, but he is killed by a parting shot.
 
John returns home. Lady Brandon reads Beaus letter, which reveals that Beau stole the gem because he knew it was a fake. Lady Brandon had sold the real one years before, and Beau wanted to protect her. As a child, he was hiding in a suit of armor and witnessed the transaction (which is shown in a flashback near the beginning of the film).
