 Western film James Craig and Angie Dickinson. This was the final film that Scott made with Warner Bros.

==Plot== Gordon Jones), recently mustered out of the army, head to Devlins brothers homestead to settle down. They arrive just in time to drive off an Indian attack, but are too late to save his brother. Faulty ammunition cost him his life. The three men set out for Medicine Bend to find out who sold the ammunition. The community also gives them all their funds to buy badly needed supplies.
 Brethren (in Christ) congregation (who have also been robbed), and are given spare clothing.  Devlin decides it would be a good idea to pretend to be Brethren while in town. They quickly connect the robbers, and latter the defective ammunition, to Ep Clark (James Craig). Clark controls the mayor and the sheriff, and has his gang waylay pioneers heading west and force other local traders out of business.

Devlin has Maitland and Clegg infiltrate Clarkâ€™s shady business by taking jobs at his store. Meanwhile, he goes to work for defiant competing merchant Elam King and his niece Priscilla (Angie Dickinson). After gaining their trust, Devlin learns that King has a secret wagon train of goods, including weapons, coming in from St. Louis. Devlin starts stealing back Clarks ill-gotten gains at night, including his mothers brooch from saloon girl Nell Garrison, Clarks reluctant girlfriend.

Clark, now suspicious of the three strangers in town, tries to lure Devlin into a trap, but barely fails. He does, however, have the sheriff arrest Maitland and Clegg. They are swiftly sentenced to hang, but Nell has taken a great liking to Maitland and persuades Sheriff Massey to do one right thing in his life and free the prisoners; unfortunately, he is shot in the back by one of Clarks men. Nell then gets Brother Abraham, leader of the local Brethren congregation, to help foil the hanging and rescue the two men.

Devlin finally comes for Clark. They brawl (ironic, given the films title), and Devlin is briefly knocked unconscious; his life is saved when Clark tries to shoot him with bad ammunition. Clark then grabs a scythe, but is fatally impaled when Devlin knocks him down.

Devlin and Maitland prepare to ride into the sunset with Priscilla and Nell respectively. Clegg surprises them by deciding to stay and serve a "hitch" with the Brethren.
