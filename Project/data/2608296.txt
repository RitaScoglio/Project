All for the Winner (Chinese: 賭聖  Literal translation: Saint of Gambling) is a 1990 Hong Kong comedy film directed by Jeffrey Lau and Corey Yuen.


==Plot==

Sing (Stephen Chow) is a mainland China country boy who arrives in Hong Kong to visit his Uncle "Blackie Tat" (Ng Man-Tat). When Sing stays with his uncle and his friends in their apartment, Blackie soon learns of Sings supernatural ability to see through objects and, later on, his ability to change playing cards by rubbing them. He takes advantage of this and turns Sing into the Dou Seng or the "Saint of Gamblers". After getting into a fight with several alleyway gamblers he meets the lovely Yee-Mong (lit. trans: Beautiful Dream, but euphemistically as wet dream), a henchman for the "King of Gamblers", and becomes infatuated with her. Sing quickly becomes a rival to the King and must win his way through a world competition to prove his skill.

==Sequels==
While All for the Winner itself was initially a parody of God of Gamblers, it was such a well-received film that it spawned many sequels of its own. The story was also officially tied into the God of Gamblers continuity as of God of Gamblers II. Although God of Gamblers II was as much of a sequel to All for the Winner as it was to the original God of Gamblers film, there is another separate film titled God of Gamblers Return that is billed as the one "true" direct sequel to the God of Gamblers franchise.
