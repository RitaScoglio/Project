== Critical response ==
 
Variety (magazine)|Variety gave the films a positive review, commenting that "the picture is amusing with some new and good effects, without the customary dose of messy slapstick one expects in a Keystone with these principals."

As was often the case in contemporary reviews of Arbuckle films, the direction of the film is singled out for praise, though it is not mentioned that Arbuckle himself is the director. The review mentions "a dandy lightning storm is a feature of the film and there are some pretty views of breakers rushing on to the shore."

The review found Al St. Johns performance not as good as his usual work for Keystone, but added "The picture is a sure laugh maker and as it is fairly clean, it is the more worthy." 
 Arbuckle retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in April and May 2006 and was cited by the curators in the introductory remarks as their favorite of Arbuckles work.
