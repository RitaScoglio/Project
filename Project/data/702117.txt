==Plot== 
Peter Parker plans to propose to Mary Jane Watson, who has just made her Broadway musical debut. Meanwhile, a meteorite crashes near the two in Central Park, and an extraterrestrial symbiote attaches itself to Peters moped. Elsewhere, police pursue escaped prisoner Flint Marko, who climbs a security fence and falls into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand and allows him to shapeshift at will as the Sandman. Peters best friend, Harry Osborn, who knows Peter is Spider-Man and him responsible for his father Norman Osborns death, attacks Peter using new weapons based on his fathers Green Goblin technology. Harry injures his head on a pipe and suffers from partial amnesia, making him forget his revenge and that Peter is Spider-Man.

During a festival honoring Spider-Man, Marko robs an armored car. NYPD Captain George Stacy tells Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Ben Parkers killer, and the deceased Dennis Carradine only an accomplice. While a vengeance-obsessed Peter sleeps, the symbiote bonds with him. Peter wakes up hanging from a skyscraper and discovers his costume has changed and his powers have been enhanced, but the symbiote brings out Peters dark side. Wearing the new black suit, Spider-Man locates Marko and fights him in a subway tunnel. He discovers water is Markos weakness and uses a water pipe to reduce the Sandman to mud.

Peters changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering, and she finds solace with Harry. Harry recovers from his amnesia and, urged on by a hallucination of his dead father, compels Mary Jane to break up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves somebody else, Harry meets with Peter and claims to be "the other guy". Later, Peter, wearing the black suit, confronts Harry and spitefully tells him his father never loved him. Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harrys face.

Under the symbiotes influence, Peter exposes Eddie Brock, a rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, by submitting doctored photographs showing Spider-Man as a criminal. Furious at having to print a retraction, J. Jonah Jameson fires Eddie. Meanwhile, the Sandman recovers from his injuries.

To make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Stacys daughter Gwen to the nightclub where Mary Jane works. Gwen catches on and storms out. Peter brawls with the bouncers and, after accidentally hitting Mary Jane, realizes the symbiote is changing him. Retreating to a church bell tower, he finds he cannot remove the suit but that the alien weakens as the bells ring. Peter tears the symbiote off and it falls to the lower tower, landing on Brock, who is praying for Peters death. The symbiote attaches to him and Brock, transformed into Venom, finds the Sandman and offers to join forces.

Brock hijacks Mary Janes taxi and hangs it from a web hundreds of feet above a sand-filled construction site. Peter seeks Harrys help, but is rejected. While Peter clashes with Brock, Harry learns the truth about his fathers death and goes to help Peter. Harry temporarily subdues a gigantic incarnation of the Sandman while Brock tries to impale Peter with Harrys glider. Harry jumps in the way and is stabbed instead. Fighting the symbiote, Peter recalls how the church bells weakened it. He grabs pipes and creates a ring around the symbiote, creating a wall of sonic vibrations. The alien releases Brock, and Peter uses his webbing to pull Brock from the creature. However, the symbiote had gained more than enough power from Peter and Brock, allowing it to live on its own without a host. Peter throws a pumpkin bomb from Harrys glider at the symbiote, but Brock jumps in to rebond with it, and both are destroyed by the blast.

Marko tells Peter he never intended to kill Ben, but only wanted his car and shot him by accident when Dennis grabbed his arm. He claims Bens death has haunted him since. Peter forgives Marko, who dissipates and floats away. Peter and Harry forgive each other, and Harry dies with Mary Jane and Peter at his side. Days later, Peter visits the jazz bar where Mary Jane is singing, and they dance.

==Production==

===Development===
 
In March 2004, with Spider-Man 2 being released the coming June, Marvel Studios had begun developing Spider-Man 3 for a release in 2007.  By the release of Spider-Man 2, a release date for Spider-Man 3 had been set for May 2, 2007 before production on the sequel had begun.  The date was later changed to May 4, 2007. In January 2005, Sony Pictures Entertainment completed a seven-figure deal with screenwriter Alvin Sargent, who had penned Spider-Man 2, to work on Spider-Man 3 with an option to write a fourth film. 
 Sandman was introduced as an antagonist, as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character.  While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics, the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Bens killer to increase Peters guilt over his death    and challenge his simplistic perception of the event.  Overall, Raimi described the film as being about Peter, Mary Jane, Harry, and the Sandman,    with Peters journey being one of forgiveness.   
 Vulture before fan base, amalgamation of Venom stories. Eddie Brock, Jr., the human part of Venom, serves as a mirror to Peter Parker, with both characters having similar jobs and romantic interests.  Brocks actions as a journalist in Spider-Man 3 also represent contemporary themes of paparazzi and tabloid journalism.    The producers also suggested adding rival love interest Gwen Stacy, filling in an "other girl" type that Raimi already created.  With so many additions, Sargent soon found his script so complex that he considered splitting it into two films, but abandoned the idea when he could not create a successful intermediate climax. 

===Filming===
Camera crews spent ten days from November 5, 2005 to November 18, 2005, to film sequences that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin work on the shots early in the project. The same steps had been taken for Spider-Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus.   
 fight scenes taking place at night. 

After August, Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups were conducted as Raimi sought to film more action scenes.  The film then wrapped in October, although in the following month, additional special effects shots were taken to finalize the production.    At the start of 2007, there were further Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up shots regarding the resolution of Sandmans story, amounting to four different versions.

John Dykstra, who won the Academy Award for Visual Effects for his work on Spider-Man 2, declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor. Dykstras colleague, Scott Stokdyk, took his place as supervisor,  leading two hundred programmers at Sony Pictures Imageworks. This group designed specific computer programs that did not exist when Spider-Man 3 began production, creating nine hundred visual effects shots.    foil to Spider-Man.|alt=Concept art for Venoms costume, which is a black-white version of Spider-Mans suit, but more muscular and with an open mouth with sharp teeth]] Ian Hunter computer models.    In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.  amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguires place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandmans chest. 

Whereas the symbiote suit worn in the comics by Spider-Man was a plain black affair with a large white spider on the front and back, the design was changed for the film to become a black version of Spider-Mans traditional costume, complete with webbing Motif (visual arts)|motif. As a consequence of this, the suit Topher Grace wore as Venom also bore the webbing motif; as producer Grant Curtis noted, "it’s the Spider-Man suit, but twisted and mangled in its own right."  Additionally, the motif gave a sense of life to the symbiote, giving it the appearance of gripping onto the characters body.  When animating the symbiote, Raimi did not want it to resemble a spider or an octopus, and to give it a sense of character. The CG model is made of many separate strands.  When animating Venom himself, animators observed footage of big cats such as lions and cheetahs for the characters agile movements.   

===Music===
Originally, Danny Elfman, the composer for the previous installments, did not plan to return for the third installment of Spider-Man because of difficulties with director Sam Raimi. Elfman said that he had a "miserable experience" working with Raimi on Spider-Man 2 and could not comfortably adapt his music.  Christopher Young was then announced to score Spider-Man 3 in Elfmans absence.  In December 2006, however, producer Grant Curtis announced that Elfman had begun collaborating with Christopher Young on the music for Spider-Man 3. 
 contrabass saxophones, contrabass clarinets, contrabass bassoons and eight very low French horns" to sound "low, aggressive and heavy". Young described Venoms theme as "Vicious, my instructions on that one were that he’s the devil personified. His theme is much more demonic sounding."    Venoms theme uses eight French horns.    Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance, but rejected the initial music to the birth of Sandman, finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough. Young had to recompose much of his score at a later stage, as the producers felt there were not enough themes from the previous films.  Ultimately, new themes for the love story, Aunt May, and Mary Jane were dropped.

 New York Alfred Molinas Doc Ock"  (referring to Alfred Molinas portrayal of the character in Spider-Man 2). James Berardinelli felt director Sam Raimi "overreached his grasp" by allowing so many villains, specifically saying, "Venom is one bad guy too many."  Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of four stars and thought Church never expressed how Sandman felt about his new powers, something Molina, as Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2, did "with a vengeance"; he said the film was "a mess," with too many villains, subplots, romantic misunderstandings, conversations and "street crowds looking high into the air and shouting oooh! this way, then swiveling and shouting aaah! that way."

 Fox News called the film a "4 star opera", noting that while long, there was plenty of humor and action.  Andy Khouri of Comic Book Resources praised the film as "easily the most complex and deftly orchestrated superhero epic ever filmed   despite the enormous amount of characters, action and Science fiction|sci-fi superhero plot going on in this film, Spider-Man 3 never feels weighted down, tedious or boring."  Jonathan Ross, a big fan of the comic books, felt the film was the best of the trilogy.  Richard Corliss of Time (magazine)|Time commended the filmmakers for their ability to "dramatize feelings of angst and personal betrayal worthy of an Ingmar Bergman film, and then to dress them up in gaudy comic-book colors".  Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe, who gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, wrote that it was a well-made, fresh film, but would leave the viewer "overfulfilled".  Jonathan Dean of Total Film felt the films complex plot helped the films pacing, in that, "it rarely feels disjointed or loose   Spider-Man cements its shelf-life."  Entertainment Weekly named the Sandman as the eighth best computer-generated film character. 
 Houston Chronicles Daily News thought the film was too devoted to the "quiet conversations" of Peter and Mary Jane, but that fans would not be disappointed by the action.  Finally, Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly felt that the director "substituted scope and scale for the warmth and wit that made those two previous pictures so memorable."

Sony announced plans to create "one of the largest" marketing campaigns in Hollywood for the October 30, 2007 release of the DVD. Beginning with a partnership with Papa Johns, Sony printed close to 8.5 billion impressions for pizza boxes, television, radio, and online ads. Sony also worked with Pringles Potato Crisp, Blu-Tack, Jolly Time Pop Corn, and Nutella. Sonys Vice President of marketing, Jennifer Anderson, stated the studio spend approximately 15% to 25% of its marketing budget on digital ad campaigns; from this, Papa Johns sent text messages to mobile phones with ads. Anderson stated that there would be three sweepstakes held for consumers, where they would be able to win prizes from Sony and its promotional partners.

== Legacy ==
 
In 2007, Spider-Man 4 entered development, with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire, Dunst and other cast members set to reprise their roles. Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned and at one time the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration. However, Raimi stated in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time and that if there were fifth and sixth films, those two films would actually be a continuation of each other.     James Vanderbilt was hired in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in early 2007 that Sony Pictures was in contact with David Koepp, who wrote the first Spider-Man film.     The script was subsequently rewritten by Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire and rewritten again by Gary Ross in October 2009.  Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider-Man 5 and Spider-Man 6. 
 Vulture and Felicia Hardy, though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics. Instead, Raimis Felicia was expected to become a brand-new superpowered figure called the Vulturess. However, several years later Raimi stated that Anne Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made. 

Sony Pictures announced in January 2010 that plans for Spider-Man 4 had been canceled due to Raimis withdrawal from the project. Raimi reportedly ended his participation due to his doubt that he could meet the planned May 6, 2011 release date while at the same time upholding the film creatively. Raimi purportedly went through four iterations of the script with different screenwriters and still "hated it".
 The Amazing Spider-Man was released on July 3, 2012, with Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker.   

In February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that Spider-Man will appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with the character appearing in an MCU film and Sony releasing a Spider-Man film produced by Feige and Pascal on July 28, 2017. Sony will continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films. Marvel Studios will also explore opportunities to integrate other characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into future Spider-Man films.   and Dylan OBrien are both being eyed for the role of Spider-Man.
