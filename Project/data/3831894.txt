==Plot summary==
Zack Elliot (Ontkean) is a successful young doctor (an oncologist) in the Los Angeles area married to Claire (Jackson), an equally successful television network executive during the early 1980s. They have been married for eight years and are generally happy in their relationship, sharing in common a love for Gilbert and Sullivan and the poetry of Rupert Brooke, to whom they were introduced by their elderly former neighbor, Winnie Bates (Wendy Hiller). Intending to start a family, the couple buy a big house together.
 hedonistic single lifestyle, picking up multiple sexual partners, frequenting gay bars and clubs, occasionally taking recreational drugs. Zack and Bart are mutually but unspokenly attracted to each other and go out for lunch. A few days later, Zack calls Bart and asks him on a dinner date. He lies to Claire, saying he has to work late. At Barts house, Zack and Bart talk and it becomes clear that Zack is not yet able to identify as gay, instead labeling himself "curious". That night Zack and Bart go to bed together, which is the first time Zack has ever had sex with another man. Afterwards, Zack wants to stay the night, but Bart, following his usual pattern, brushes him off. Angered, Zack leaves but returns the next day to confront Bart further about Barts fear of intimacy. Bart makes plans for them to get together during the weekend.
 
Claire, concerned about the growing distance in her marriage, goes to her boss seeking a year-long leave of absence. Instead, he promotes her and sends her to New York City on a weekend business trip. Zack takes advantage of the opportunity to spend more time with Bart, but they end up arguing. Zack calls the outline for Barts new novel less than honest, and Bart confronts Zack about his own lack of honesty about his sexuality. That night in bed, Zack tells Bart that he loves him. The next morning, fearful of his own growing feelings for Zack, Bart pushes him away again.

Eventually, Bart realizes that he does have feelings for Zack but that he is not ready for the level of commitment that Zack needs. He is last seen in the film back out in the bars, cruising.

With Claire home from her trip, Zack tells Claire of his feelings for other men. Although she said she could handle anything he could tell her, she reacts very badly and Zack leaves the house. A few days later, an emotional Claire trashes some of Zacks clothes and finds a matchbook with a mans name and number written in it. She locates someone Zack had picked up, and they talk. She learns that he lives  a relatively normal and happy life. Claire attempts to get Zack to remain in the marriage, even claiming that she would be okay with him having affairs with other men, but Zack advises her that she must let go. Zack then tells Claire that he has a job prospect in New York City, working with cancer patients. In the end, the two agree to a divorce.

The film ends a few years in the future, with the death of Winnie Bates, Zack and Claires former neighbor. Zack is living in New York and in a committed relationship with another man by this time, but he returns to Los Angeles for the funeral. Claire has since gotten re-married to an architect and has a young son named Rupert. After the funeral, Zack and Claire discuss their lives and express their own happiness and their gratitude that the other is happy.

Throughout the film, Bart and Claire deliver several mini-monologues, speaking directly to the camera about aspects of their lives and their feelings about the scenes that had just played out on-screen.

==Production==
Director Arthur Hiller approached Tom Berenger, Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, William Hurt and Peter Strauss to play Zack before giving the part to Michael Ontkean. According to Hiller, the reaction of most actors he approached was to tell him not to even consider them for the role.   The film reunited Jackson and Ontkean, who had previously costarred in the 1970s crime drama The Rookies.
 Making Love", Bruce Roberts, and Carole Bayer Sager. It was Flacks final Top 40 hit as a solo performer.

==Themes== Hollywood drama closeted and coming out has on a marriage.     The film contrasts two visions of the so-called "gay lifestyle". Zack wants to settle into a long-term relationship similar to a heterosexual marriage, while Bart represents the somewhat stereotypical view of gay men as being promiscuous and uninterested in forming commitments.

Issues of the tension many women felt over pursuing careers are also touched on in Claires fears that she is being forced to choose between her career and having a baby. By the films end, she does have a child, but it is unstated whether she is still working, so that issue ultimately remains unresolved.

==Critical reaction== straight critics found the film boring while gay critics, glad for any attention paid to the subject, praised it. Making Love opened strong at the box office its first week, but poor word of mouth led to a large drop-off in box office receipts the following week.

Janet Maslin from The New York Times wrote “Claire and Zaco of Arthur Hiller’s Making Love, are a lot like Jenny and Oliver of Mr. Hiller’s Love Story”    

Cultural critic Camille Paglia calls Making Love "intelligent" and states that "it remains my favorite film to date about gay men." 

==DVD release==
Making Love was released on Region 1 DVD on February 7, 2006.

==Awards and nominations== Bruce Roberts (lyrics/music), Carole Bayer Sager (lyrics)
