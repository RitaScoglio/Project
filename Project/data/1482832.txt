==Production notes==
Key scenes were shot on location in early 1973 in San Francisco at Candlestick Park, then home of the Major League Baseball San Francisco Giants, and later the home of the National Football Leagues San Francisco 49ers until 2014.   One chase sequence was filmed on the (now-demolished) Embarcadero Freeway, which ends with Caan and Arkins car crashing into an apartment building next to the freeway. After the car lands in an elderly couples bedroom as they are watching television, Arkin collapses from nervous shock against the wall as Caan calls for a tow truck, checking the third floor address by reading the couples mail. The couple seem unaffected by the car crashing through the wall.

Plans to distribute the film in early 1974 were shelved due to concerns about competition with Peter Hyams similar Busting. Freebie and the Bean was finally issued as a Christmas release, and became a substantial box office success. 
 Warner Archive label.
