==Plot==
 
 

A thousand years ago on the planet Thra, a magical crystal cracked, and two new races appeared: the malevolent Skeksis, who use the power of the "Dark Crystal" to continually replenish themselves, and kind wizards called Characters and races of the Dark Crystal#The urRu / Mystics|Mystics.
 Gelfling taken Chamberlain and Garthim to track him.
 Podlings who raised Kira after the death of her parents. However, the Garthim attack the village and Kira, Jen, and Fizzgig flee when the Chamberlain prevents one of the Garthim from attacking them. Most of the Podlings are enslaved.

Jen and Kira discover a ruined Gelfling city. Finding a relief with prophetic writing, Jen discovers that the shard, a part of the Dark Crystal, must be reinserted to restore the Crystals integrity. The Chamberlain tells Jen and Kira that he wishes to bring them to the Skeksis to make peace, but they distrust him and refuse. Riding on Characters and races of the Dark Crystal#Landstriders|Landstriders, the Gelflings arrive at the Castle of the Crystal, where they see the Garthim that attacked Kiras village. Kira and Jen unsuccessfully attempt to free the captured Podlings. Kira, Jen and Fizzgig infiltrate the lower parts of the Castle. The Chamberlain confronts them again and tries to convince them to make peace; however, the Chamberlain wounds Jen and takes Kira to the Castle. The General restores the Chamberlain to his former position. On the suggestion of the Skeksis resident scientist, the General decides to regain his youth by draining Kiras life essence, recalling that its potency allows a Skeksis emperor to maintain his youth for longer periods than that of the Podlings on whom they have been forced to rely since the Gelfling genocide. Aughra tells Kira to call out to the animals imprisoned in the laboratory. They break free from their cages and the Skeksis scientist falls to his death, upon which his Mystic counterpart simultaneously vanishes.

The three suns begin to align as the two Gelflings reconvene in the Crystal chamber. The Skeksis arrive to prepare for the immortality that they will gain from the Conjunction if the Crystal is not restored. Jen is discovered and drops the shard, but Kira throws it back to him and is stabbed to death by the Skeksis high priest. Jen inserts the shard into the Crystal, unifying it as the Mystics enter the chamber and the dark palace begins to crumble away and transform into a castle of bright crystal. As Aughra, Jen and Fizzgig watch, the Mystics and Skeksis merge into tall glowing beings, known as UrSkeks, one of whom says "we are again one", speaks to Jen of their history, and revives Kira. After leaving the Crystal for the two Gelflings to "make   world in its light," the UrSkeks depart, and the land is shown rejuvenated and the Castle transformed into a palace of crystal.

==Production==

===Development===
 

Hensons inspiration for the visual aspects of the film came around 1975-76,   #32 ,February, 1983  after he saw an illustration by Leonard B. Lubin in a 1975 edition of  , which also took place in an alien world with no human characters.  According to co-director  .  The character Kira was also at that point called Dee. 

Most of the philosophical undertones of the film were inspired from Jane Roberts "Seth Material". Henson kept multiple copies of the book Seth Speaks, and insisted that Froud and screenwriter David Odell read it prior to collaborating for the film. Odell later wrote that Aughras line "He could be anywhere then," upon being told by Jen that his Master was dead, couldnt have been written without having first read Roberts material. 
 Russian and other Slavic languages could understand individual words, but not whole sentences. 

The film was shot at Elstree Studios, and exterior scenes were shot in the Scottish Highlands; Gordale Scar, North Yorkshire, England; and Twycross, Leicestershire, England.

Once filming was completed, the films release was delayed after Lew Grade sold ITC Entertainment to Robert Holmes à Court, who was skeptical of the films potential, due to the bad reactions at the preview and the need to revoice the films soundtrack. The film was afforded minimal advertisement and release until Henson bought it from Holmes à Court and funded its release with his own money. 

===Design===
 , Georgia, USA.]]
Brian Froud was chosen as concept artist after Henson saw one of his paintings in the book Once upon a time.  The characters in the film are elaborate puppets, and none are based on humans or any other specific Earth creature. Before its release, The Dark Crystal was billed as the first live-action film without any human beings on screen, and "a showcase for cutting-edge animatronics".  The hands and facial features of the groundbreaking animatronic puppets in the film were controlled with relatively primitive rods and cables, although radio control later took over many of the subtler movements.  Human performers inside the puppets supplied basic movement for the larger creatures, which in some cases was dangerous or exhausting; for example, the Garthim costumes were so heavy that the performers had to be hung up on a rack every few minutes to rest while still inside the costumes.  A mime from Switzerland was hired to help choreograph the movements of the puppeteers. 

When conceptualizing the Skeksis, Henson had in mind the Seven Deadly Sins, though because there were 10 Skeksis, some sins had to be invented or used twice. Making-of. The World of the Dark Crystal. Dir. Jim Henson & Frank Oz. 1982. Colombia Tristar Home Video, 1999. DVD.  Froud originally designed them to resemble deep sea fish, Making-of. Reflections of the Dark Crystal: Light on the Path of Creation. Dir. Michael Gillis. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, 2007. DVD.  but later designed them as "part reptile, part predatory bird, part dragon", with an emphasis on giving them a "penetrating stare."  Each Skeksis was conceived as having a different "job" or function, thus each puppet was draped in multicolored robes meant to reflect their personalities and thought processes.  Each Skeksis suit required a main performer, whose arm would be extended over his/her head in order to operate the creatures facial movements, while the other arm operated its left hand. Another performer would operate the Skeksis right arm. The Skeksis performers compensated for their lack of vision by having a monitor tied to their chests. Making-of. Reflections of the Dark Crystal: Shard of Illusion. Dir. Michael Gillis. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, 2007. DVD. 
 geometric symbolism throughout the film in order to hint at the implied unity of the two races.  The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their haunches with their right arm extended forward, with the full weight of the head on it. Henson himself could only hold a position in a Mystic costume for only 5–10 seconds. 
 Wendy Midener. Hindu deity Rama, but this idea was scrapped early on. 
 Tourettes syndrome" Watership Down. Although originally voiced by Frank Oz, Henson wanted a female voice, and subsequently selected Billie Whitelaw. 

The character Fizzgig was invented by Frank Oz, who wanted a character who served the same function as the Muppet poodle Foo-Foo, feeling that, like Miss Piggy, the character Kira needed an outlet for her caring, nurturing side.  The characters design was meant to convey the idea of a "boyfriend-repellant", to contrast the popular idea that it is easier to form a bond with a member of the opposite sex with the assistance of a cute dog. 

The Podlings were envisioned as people in complete harmony with their natural surroundings, thus Froud based their design on that of potatoes.  Their village was modeled on the Henson family home. 

In designing the Garthim, Froud took inspiration from the discarded carapaces of his and Hensons lobster dinners.   The Garthim were first designed three years into the making of the film, and were made largely of fiberglass. Each costume weighed around 70&nbsp;lbs, thus Garthim performers still in costume had to frequently be suspended on racks in order to recuperate. 

The Dark Crystal was the last film in which cinematographer Oswald Morris involved himself in before retiring. He shot all the footage with a light flex, a unit placed in front of the camera which gave a faint colour tint to each scene in order to give the film a more fairy tale atmosphere similar to Frouds original paintings. 

===Music=== Trevor Jones, who became involved before shooting had started. Jones initially wanted to compose a score which reflected the settings oddness by using acoustical instruments, electronics and building structures. This was scrapped in favor of an orchestral score once Gary Kurtz became involved, as it was felt that an unusual score would alienate audiences. The main theme of the film is a composite of the Skeksis and Mystics themes.  Jones wrote the baby Landstrider theme in honour of his newly born daughter. 

==Release==

===Box office===
The Dark Crystal was released in 858 theaters in North America on December 17, 1982. In its initial weekends, it had a limited appeal with audiences for various reasons including parental concerns about its dark nature, creative connections with Hensons family-friendly Muppet franchise and because it was overshadowed by the films competition over the Christmas of that year, including Tootsie and the already massively successful E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.  By the end of its box office run, it made $40,577,001 managing to turn in a profit. The film became the 16th highest grossing film of 1982 within North America. 

===Critical response===
The film received a mixed response upon its original release, but has earned a better reception in later years, becoming a favorite with fans of Henson and fantasy.  It currently holds a 71% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Vincent Canby of The New York Times negatively reviewed the film, describing it as a "watered down J. R. R. Tolkien ... without charm as well as interest."  Kevin Thomas gave it a more positive assessment in the Los Angeles Times: "Unlike many screen fantasies, The Dark Crystal casts its spell from its very first frames and proceeds so briskly that its over before you realize it. Youre left with the feeling that you have just awakened from a dream."  
In 2008, the film was one of the 50 movies nominated for AFIs 10 Top 10#Fantasy|AFIs Top 10 Fantasy Films list. 

The film was banned in Iran for its ceremonial imagery, which was deemed "blasphemous".

It was released on Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray on September 29, 2009.

==Sequel== Michael and Museum of the Moving Image on September 18, 2011 to commemorate the legacy of Jim Henson, his daughter Cheryl revealed that the project was yet again on hiatus.  More recently, it was reported in February 2012 that Omnilab Media and the Spierig brothers had parted ways with the Henson Company due to budgetary concerns; production on the film has been suspended indefinitely. 

On July 1, 2013, an announcement was made by The Jim Henson Company, in association with Grosset and Dunlap (a publishing division of Penguin Group USA) that they would be hosting a Dark Crystal Author Quest Contest to write a new Dark Crystal novel, as a prequel to the original film. It would be set in the Dark Crystal world during a Gelfling Gathering.  The winning author was J.M. (Joseph) Lee of Minneapolis, Minn. whose story, "The Ring of Dreams," was selected from almost 500 contest submissions.  He was awarded a publishing contract with Penguin worth $10,000 (US). In May 2014, Lisa Henson confirmed that the film was still in development, but it is not yet in pre-production. 

==In other media== The World of The Dark Crystal, written by J. J. Llewellyn and illustrated by Brian Froud, was released at the same time as the film. The book expands greatly on the world of "Thra", detailing its conditions and history, as well as providing some additional story background.

* A tie-in novelization of the film was written by A.C.H. Smith. Henson took a keen interest in the novelization, as he considered it a legitimate part of the films world rather than just an advertisement. He originally asked Alan Garner to write it, but he declined on account of prior engagements. Henson and Smith met several times over meals to discuss the progress of the manuscript. According to Smith, the only major disagreement they had arose over his dislike of the Podlings, which he considered "boring". He included a scene in which a Garthim carrying a sackful of Podlings fell down a cliff and crushed them. Henson considered this scene to be an element of "gratuitous cruelty" which did not fit well into the scope of the story. In order to assist Smith in his visualising the world of The Dark Crystal, Henson invited him to visit Elstree Studios during the filming of the movie.  In June 2014, Archaia Entertainment reprinted the novelization, though included extras such as some of Brian Frouds illustrations, and Jim Hensons notes. 

* An illustrated childrens storybook version, The Tale of the Dark Crystal, written by Donna Bass and illustrated by Bruce McNally.

* A board game called "The Dark Crystal Game" was also released in 1982 (see List of Milton Bradley Company products).

* A Book-and-record set|book-and-cassette adaptation was released in 1983 by Disneyland Records as part of its Disneyland Records#Sci-fi and fantasy series tapeography|Read-Along Adventures series.

 Vogue commissioned six of the films costume designers to fashion clothes based on the characters of the film. 

* Music duo The Crystal Method used samples from the film in the song "Trip Like I Do", released on their 1997 album Vegas (The Crystal Method album)|Vegas.

* Legends of the Dark Crystal, an original English-language manga written by Barbara Kesel with art by Heidi Arnhold, Jessica Feinberg, and Max Kim, was published by TokyoPop. Its story is set hundreds of years before the events of The Dark Crystal, after the Great Conjunction which saw the splitting of the UrSkeks into the Mystics and the Skeksis, but before the Great Extermination of the Gelflings. The first volume of the series came out November 2007, followed some time later by the second in August 2010. A third installment had been originally planned but was cancelled and subsequently merged into the second volume. 
 Archaia Entertainment as a series of three graphic novels.  The Henson Company and Archaia began collaborating on this project in late 2009.  A brief preview was made available on Free Comic Book Day in May 2011,  and the first installment was released January 2012, shortly thereafter spending two weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list|The New York Times Best Seller list of hardcover graphic books. In February 2013, the second installment was officially released. The third and final part has yet to be released.

* In February 2011, Sandstorm Productions – a firm that partnered with various design studios to facilitate the development and distribution of board games and collectible card games – revealed that it had acquired the license to produce games based on various Henson properties, including The Dark Crystal.  Before any definitive plans were made, however, Sandstorm went out of business in June 2012.

* Archaia announced plans for a role-playing game based on The Dark Crystal at the August 2011 Gen Con gaming convention, intending to publish it later the following year. Like its Origins Award-winning Mouse Guard game, The Dark Crystal will be designed by Luke Crane and utilize mechanics similar to that of The Burning Wheel.   As of September 2012, it remains in active development, with more details forthcoming in 2013.

* In August 2013, Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab - a company that produces body and household blends with a dark, romantic Gothic tone - debuted the first of their licensed The Dark Crystal perfumes. The debut included four Skeksis blends: Ung the Garthim-Master, SkekNa the Slave-Master, SkekTek the Scientist and SkekZok the Ritual-Master.  

* In the Jim Hensons Creature Shop Challenge episode "Return of the Skeksis," the competing creature designers had to work in teams of three to build a Skeksis that has been banished to different parts of Thra and has been called back to the Skeksis Castle.
