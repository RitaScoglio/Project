==Plot==
A humble woman (Swanson) marries a wealthy man (Ames). Their marriage is annulled by the mans father (Holden), who considers her a fortune-hunter, and she is left alone to raise her child. She later becomes a "kept woman" for an older, married man.  When the man dies, leaving Swanson a $500,000 inheritance, the press is quick to cast doubts upon the paternity of Swansons child.  Her ex-husband has since remarried, and now comes back into Swansons life.  For the sake of her child, she sends the boy to live with her ex and his wife.  The wife dies and the film ends happily (if improbably) with Swanson reunited with her ex-husband.
