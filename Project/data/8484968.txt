The Heart of the Angel
The Heart of the Angel is a 40-minute documentary made by director/producer Molly Dineen in 1989, before the 1992 renovation of the then 100-year-old Angel tube station on the London Underground. 

The film follows 48 hours in the everyday lives of the people who work in the station, including London Underground foreman Ray Stocker, ticket-seller Derek Perkins, the groups of women called fluffers who clean human hair out of the tracks to avoid the fire hazard and the gangs of men who work with pickaxes in almost pitch-black conditions to renovate parts of the track in time for the following day.
 
This documentary was given the Documentary Award by the Royal Television Society.
