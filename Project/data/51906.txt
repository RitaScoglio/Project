 novella of the same name by Truman Capote.

Hepburns portrayal of Holly Golightly as the naïve, eccentric café society girl is generally considered to be the actresss most memorable and identifiable role. Hepburn regarded it as one of her most challenging roles, since she was an introvert required to play an extrovert. 
 Best Adapted Best Art Direction.

In 2012, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. 

==Plot==
One early morning, a yellow taxi pulls up at Tiffany & Co. on Fifth Avenue in New York City, from which elegantly dressed Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) emerges. Standing outside the shop looking into the windows, she nibbles on pastry and drinks coffee she brought with her, then strolls home to go to bed. Outside her apartment, she fends off her date Sid Arbuck (Claude Stroud) from the disastrous night before. Later in the day she is awakened by new neighbor-tenant, Paul Varjak (George Peppard), ringing her doorbell to get into the building. The pair chat as she dresses to leave for her weekly visit to Sally Tomato (Alan Reed), a mobster incarcerated at Sing Sing prison. Tomatos lawyer OShaughnessy pays her $100 a week to receive "the weather report."

  as Holly Golightly.]] Stanley Adams), a rich American.

In the days that follow, Paul and Holly become closer. One day, 2E enters Pauls apartment, worried that she is being followed. Paul tells her that he will investigate and eventually confronts Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen), Hollys husband. Doc explains that Hollys real name is Lula Mae Barnes, whom he married when she was 13 ("going on 14"), and that he wants to take her back to Texas, as Fred will be returning from the army. After Paul reunites Holly and Doc, she tells Paul the marriage was annulled; Doc is in denial over it. Holly asks Paul to accompany her and Doc to the bus station. There she tells Doc she is not returning. Doc reveals that Fred is returning soon and tells her that if she does not return, he will not support him when he returns. Holly still refuses, and tells him she plans for Fred to live with her in New York. Doc leaves broken-hearted.

After drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to her apartment, where she drunkenly tells him that she plans to marry Rusty Trawler for his money. A few days later, Paul learns that one of his short stories has been accepted for publication. On the way to tell Holly, he sees the newspaper at her door, its headline stating that Trawler has married someone else. Holly and Paul agree to spend the day together, taking turns doing things that each has never done before. At Tiffanys, Paul has the ring from Doc Golightlys box of Cracker Jack engraved as a present for Holly. After spending the night together, he awakens to find that she is not in his apartment, nor has she returned to her apartment. When 2E arrives at his apartment later, Paul ends his relationship with her.

Holly schemes to marry José for his money, which angers Paul, who has firmly decided on his love for her. After Holly and José return to her apartment to find a telegram notifying her of Freds death, she trashes her apartment in grief, her behavior disturbing José. Months later, Paul has moved out of the building. He is invited to dinner by Holly, who is leaving the next morning for Brazil to continue her relationship with José. However, they are soon arrested by police in connection with Sally Tomatos drug ring and taken to the 19th precinct, where Holly spends the night in jail.

The next morning, Holly is released on bail with help from O.J. and finds Paul waiting with a taxi. He has her cat and a letter from José explaining he must end their relationship due to her arrest. Holly insists she will go to Brazil anyway and releases the cat from the taxi into the rain. Paul confronts Holly about his love and her behavior, then leaves the cab, tossing the ring he had engraved for her into her lap and telling her to examine her life. She quickly runs after Paul, who has gone looking for the cat, and together they find him, look into each others eyes, and kiss.

==Production==

===Development===
 
The Oscar-nominated screenplay was written by George Axelrod, loosely based on the novella by Truman Capote. Changes were made to fit the medium of cinema and to correspond to the filmmakers vision.

===Pre-production=== The Misfits instead. When Hepburn was cast instead of Monroe, Capote remarked: "Paramount double-crossed me in every way and cast Audrey".   
 Richard Shepherd had picked John Frankenheimer as the director,  but Hepburn said: "Ive never heard of him" and he was replaced on her request.

===Principal photography===
 
Most of the exteriors were filmed in New York City, except the fire escape scenes and the alley scene at the end in the rain where Holly puts Cat out of the cab and then Paul and Holly look for Cat. All of the interiors, except for portions of the scene inside Tiffany & Company, were filmed on the Paramount Studios lot in Hollywood. 
 electrocution of a crew member are all said to have made capturing the scene a challenge. 

In an interview given for the 45th anniversary DVD, Edwards said that the sequence was captured rather quickly due to the good fortune of an unexpected traffic lull despite the location in the heart of Manhattan.

===Music===
 
 Richard Shepherd Manhattan Tower had been out fairly recently): "Marty   and I both said over our dead bodies."  According to Mancini and Edwards, a studio executive hated the song and demanded it be cut from the film; Hepburn, who was present, responded to the suggestion by standing up and saying, "Over my dead body!" 
 combo jazz. "Moon River" is sobbed by a plaintive harmonica, repeated by strings, hummed and then sung by the chorus, finally resolved with the harmonica again."   

==Reception== High Time) goes on to an out-of-character end."   Almost a half century later, Time commented on the pivotal impact of Hepburns portrayal of Golightly:  The Childrens Two for Wait Until Dark. 
 East Side areas captured in the loveliest of colors"; in reviewing the performances, the newspaper said Holly Golightly is "as implausible as ever. But in the person of Miss Hepburn, she is a genuinely charming, elfin waif who will be believed and adored when seen. George Peppard is casual and, for the most part, a subdued citizen who seems to like observing better than participating in the proceedings. Martin Balsam makes a properly brash, snappy Hollywood agent. Mickey Rooneys bucktoothed, myopic Japanese is broadly exotic. Patricia Neal is simply cool and brisk in her few appearances as Mr. Peppards sponsor and Vilallonga, is properly suave and Continental as Miss Hepburns Brazilian, while Buddy Ebsen has a brief poignant moment as Miss Hepburns husband."   
 Gerald Clarke, deemed the film a “valentine” to free-spirited women rather than a cautionary tale about a little girl lost in the big city. “The movie is a confection — a sugar and spice confection.” 

Rotten Tomatoes currently holds an 88% Fresh rating with the consensus: "It contains some ugly anachronisms, but Blake Edwards is at his funniest in this iconic classic, and Audrey Hepburn absolutely lights up the screen." 

===Influence===
  as Holly Golightly in the films trailer]] chignon and American cinema.  Another iconic item throughout the movie is Hollys sunglasses. Often misidentified as Ray-Ban, they are Manhattan sunglasses manufactured by Oliver Goldsmith. In 2011 the model was re-released to mark the 50th anniversary of Breakfast at Tiffanys.  One of three dresses designed by Givenchy for Hepburn for possible use in the film sold at auction by Christies  on December 5, 2006 for £467,200 (~US$947,000), about seven times the reserve price.  The Black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn|"Little Black Dress" by Givenchy, worn by Hepburn in the beginning of the film is cited as one of the most iconic items of clothing in the history of the twentieth century and is, perhaps, the most famous little black dress of all time.            
 Disney Davy Crockett sidekick Buddy Ebsen, who had a small but effective role in this film as Doc Golightly, Hollys ex-husband. His success here led directly to his best-known role as Jed Clampett on The Beverly Hillbillies. 

===Portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi===
  

For his portrayal of I. Y. Yunioshi, Mickey Rooney wore makeup and a prosthetic mouthpiece to change his features to a caricatured approximation of a Japanese person. Since the 1990s, it has been subject to increasing protest by Asian-Americans among others. For instance, in the 1993 film,  , the film is used as an illustration of Hollywoods racist depiction of Asians when Bruce Lee and his future wife, Linda, see the film and Linda suggests they leave when she notices that Bruce is upset at Rooneys caricatured performance.
 Japanese ethnicity; it was director Blake Edwards decision to keep Rooney.   In a "making-of" for the 45th anniversary edition DVD release, Shepherd repeatedly apologizes, saying, "If we could just change Mickey Rooney, Id be thrilled with the movie." Breakfast at Tiffanys: The Making of a Classic  Director Blake Edwards stated, "Looking back, I wish I had never done it... and I would give anything to be able to recast it, but its there, and onward and upward." 

In a 2008 interview about the film, 87-year-old Rooney said he was heartbroken about the criticism: "Blake Edwards... wanted me to do it because he was a comedy director. They hired me to do this overboard, and we had fun doing it.... Never in all the more than 40 years after we made it – not one complaint. Every place Ive gone in the world people say, God, you were so funny. Asians and Chinese come up to me and say, Mickey you were out of this world."   
Rooney also said that if hed known people would be so offended, "I wouldnt have done it. Those that didnt like it, I forgive them and God bless America, God bless the universe, God bless Japanese, Chinese, Indians, all of them and lets have peace."
