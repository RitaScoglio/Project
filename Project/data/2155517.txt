== Plot ==
Philip and Alexandria Marcus are a young couple who decide to take a vacation to a friends house in the Arizona Desert. Alex feels very lonely because Phil is always busy with work, and they can never enjoy their marriage. Meanwhile, Randall, a dangerous crook has just been released from jail, where he spent six months because of his ex-girlfriend Celeste. Randall plans on getting revenge to Celeste for locking him up, and, while going towards Celestes home, he finds Maggie, a prostitute and picks her up. Later, that night, when Randy and Maggie take a rest, Maggie tries to kill Randall, but Randall takes the gun out of her hand, lays her on the car and has sex with her. The two team up and become a couple.
Although Phil and Alex took a vacation to take a rest from responsibilities and enjoy, Phil is still busy and doesnt have time for Alex, which frustrates her. He agreed to go to a night bar with her. The club is full of drunk people, prostitutes and criminals. Randall and Maggie are also in the bar. Alex goes to the bathroom and Maggie follows her there, while a drunk biker sits on Alexs stool next to Phil. Phil tries to reason with the biker, but the biker refuses to go somewhere else, and starts harassing and disrespecting Alex, by saying hell only let her sit if she gives him a blowjob. Phil splashes biker with the water, which becomes very furious with Phil. Just moments before hitting Phil, Randall shows up, saves Phil and intimidates biker to never commit the same mistake ever again.
Phil and Alex decide to go home, and they transport Randy and Maggie to the trailer park, where Celeste lives. Terror couple enters her trailer with a trick. When Celeste sees Randy, she becomes really scared and starts crying. Randy comforts her, telling that he wont hurt her and things are okay. However, Maggie and Celeste have sex all night long, with Randy watching. In the morning, Randy forces Maggie into killing Celeste, which she does. Randy and Phil had a deal that Randy will drive Phil through the desert so he can find plants for his job.
In the early morning, Randy and Maggie arrive at Phils borrowed house. Phil and Randy leave, while Maggie and Alex stay in the house. Meanwhile, the police are searching for Randy and Maggie who committed several crimes (killing people, robbing a grocery shop, locking a store clerk in the bathroom etc.).
While driving through the desert, Phil tells Randall his job/marriage problems and that Alex gets so nervous because Phil doesnt pay attention to her, with Randall saying: Women, you cant live with em, you cant kill em!
Randall takes Phil to a top of the hill in the desert, telling him thats where Phil can find what hes looking for. On the top, Randall hits Phil in the head and pushes him off the cliff.
Meanwhile, Alex finds a gun in Maggies leather jacket and gets suspicious. She calls the police, but Maggie interrupts her so she hangs up. Later, she decides not to call the police, telling herself shes overreacting. However, in the kitchen, Maggie hears the police report saying theres a dangerous criminal with a matching description of Maggie. Maggie shoots the radio with a gun and confirms Alexs suspicions.
Randall returns to Phils house, with Alex wondering where is Phil. Randall tells that he didnt do anything, and that he just took Philip where he wanted to go. Phil, who has fell from the cliff is in the desert and alive. Phil walks through the desert, trying to get home, worrying about Alex.
During this time, Alex tries to escape the house with noone knowing, but she fails because there were no car keys.
In the desert, Philip reaches trailer park, and finds the dead Celeste, already knowing who did it. Phil takes the motorcycle parked next to the trailer and heads towards his house. In the night, the bikes fuel tank is empty and Phil is stuck again, while Alex tries to turn Randall and Maggie against each other, thus having sex with both of them and asking each one of them to go alone and leave the third party. Town sheriff, luckily, finds Phil on the street and takes him to his house, while Phil tells the whole story.
Randall and Maggie decide to leave, but Randall tells Maggie to kill Alex, just like she killed Celeste. Meanwhile, Phil and Sheriff sneak into the house yard and decide to assault the criminals.
Maggie aims the gun at Alex, but changes feelings and then aims the gun at Randall. Realizing hes gone too far, she tries to shoot him, but the gun is empty, since Randall overseen the situation, which would prove that noone cant mess with him.
Randall loads the gun, points it at Maggie and decides to murder her for betraying him. While Randall is aiming Maggie, sheriff is aiming a shotgun at Randalls head. Sheriff incidentally shoots and immediately kills Maggie and Randall quickly shoots and kills sheriff. Alex escapes upstairs and lights are turned off. Randall eventually finds Alex, who sprays him in the face. Randall gets really angry and starts chasing her, and also finding Phil looking for him and holding him at gunpoint.
