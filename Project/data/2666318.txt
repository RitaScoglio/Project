==Reception== Entertainment Weeklys list of the  .

The film was well received by many critics, and subsequently nominated for eight awards, and won six, including the British Independent Film Award 1998.

In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Paula Nechak praised the film for allowing the characters to be themselves rather than change to fit in, and praises the treatment of the jock character John as being just as bound by the school popularity game as Steven.   

Roger Ebert commented “Certainly this film has deeper values than the mainstream teenage comedies that retail aggressive materialism, soft-core sex and shallow ideas about “popularity.”    Steven Holden from The New York Times wrote “The movie captures the excruciating paranoia of a situation in which there’s nowhere the lovers can be alone except in each other’s homes on the rare occasions their parents are out.” 
 Daily Record, Siobhan Synnot criticised the film as being like a "preachy episode of Grange Hill with cardboard cut-out characters" and also criticised the John character for being unbelievable, describing him as "simply a bland fantasy hunk. Its hard to see how this dim bulb is bright enough for Oxford, because all the smart lines go to his smart-alec boyfriend."
