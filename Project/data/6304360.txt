==Film delays==
The rights to the novel once belonged to Mel Brooks, though he let them lapse.  Towne met Fante in the 1970s.  This meeting led to his interest in the project. Despite finishing the script in the early 1990s, he couldnt find financial backing from a studio.  During this time, Farrells role was originally set to be played by Johnny Depp but he dropped out.  Later Val Kilmer accepted the role and also dropped out.  Another delay was Hayek initially rejecting the role to avoid being typecast as a Mexican immigrant.  She accepted the role eight years later.

==Critical reception==
The film received negative to mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 35% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 104 reviews.  Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 58 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.
