==Plot== Paul Stewart), the manager who found him and helped pave his road to fame.
 Arthur Kennedy) are crossing America by thumb and freight cars from Chicago to California, where they have bought a share in a restaurant. Along the way, they hitch a lift from a car carrying a top boxer, Johnny Dunne, and his girlfriend Grace Diamond (Marilyn Maxwell). They are driven to Kansas City where Dunne is fighting another contender that night.

Midge needs money and is offered a fight on the under-card for $35. After taking a beating, the promoter only pays him ten. The fight brings him to the attention of fight trainer Tommy Haley, who tells him to come to his gym in Los Angeles if he ever needs a break. Kelly is not interested.

Once they reach Los Angeles, however, they discover they have been conned. The brothers need to secure jobs waiting tables and washing dishes. Both strike up a relationship with the owners daughter. When Midge Kelly is discovered with her, they are forced to marry by her outraged father.

After the shotgun wedding, Kelly abandons his new wife and flees with his brother. They head to the gym owned by Haley.

Kelly enters his new field with a single-minded devotion. He defeats a number of local fighters, begins touring the country and is soon ranked as a contender. He is matched with Johnny Dunne, who is in line for a championship fight. Organized crime figures lean on Kelly to throw the match, guaranteeing him a legitimate shot at the title the following year if he complies. Kelly agrees, but then goes back on his word and destroys the complacent Dunne in a single round.

Seeing which way the wind is blowing, Grace Diamond now attaches herself to Kelly. She persuades him to abandon his manager Haley and take on the management of Jerome Harris, an extremely wealthy and influential figure in the fight game with criminal ties. Realizing this is the only way he will get a shot at the title, Kelly agrees. His brother is so disgusted that he walks out, going to live with Midges abandoned wife in Chicago.

Kelly takes the title and becomes a popular fan favorite because of his rise from humble beginnings. He soon becomes involved with the wife of his new manager, Palmer Harris, a sculptor. She falls in love with him and persuades Kelly to ask her husband for a divorce. Harris refuses and instead offers Kelly a large sum of money if he relinquishes his wife. Kelly agrees, leaving Palmer brokenhearted.

He has been fighting a number of second-rate challengers, but now he has agreed to fight Dunne, who has been making a comeback. Dunne is in good shape and Kelly quickly realizes he is going to lose unless he does something fast. He hires back his old manager, and his brother and ex-wife come back into the camp. They are now engaged to be married, but Kelly responds by seducing her, just to show he can.

Kelly fights Dunne in the sporting event of the year. He knocks down the challenger in the first round. Dunne manages to get up and the balance of the fight shifts in his direction. He starts pounding Kelly, pummeling his face. Kellys manager tries to throw in the towel, but Midge refuses and fights on, taking more punishment. Kelly rallies at the end of the fight. But he is seriously injured and dies of a cerebral hemorrhage.

==Reception==

===Critical response=== Body and Soul" which might have served as a model for "Champion," this is a stinging fight film to see. If one has seen that other, this will look a little pale." 

The staff at Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine gave the picture a good review and also noted the difference between the screenplay and the original story.  They wrote, "Adapted from a Ring Lardner short story of the same title, Champion is a stark, realistic study of the boxing rackets and the degeneracy of a prizefighter. Fight scenes, under Franz Planers camera, have realism and impact. Unrelenting pace is set by the opening sequence. Cast, under Mark Robsons tight direction, is fine. Kirk Douglas is the boxer and he makes the character live. Second honors go jointly to Arthur Kennedy, the fighters crippled brother, and Paul Stewart as the knowing manager." 

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 92% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on thirteen reviews.
