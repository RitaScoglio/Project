Le Big-Bang is an X-rated animated science fiction fantasy film, originally released in 1987 by 20th Century Fox in France and Entertainment Film Distributors, Ltd. in the United Kingdom.

==Plot== America and Russia merge, containing a mutated strain of males, forming the USSSR. In the south, all that is left of womankind retreat to their territory of Vaginia. The armies of these two nations are soon at odds with each other as they perfect their most destructive weapons capable of destroying the universe.
 garbageman to asses during World War III. The women were safe underground. When the war was over, and the women came back up and saw the men without their asses, they just laughed. The Comrade-In-Chief plans to destroy Vaginia with their weapon "The Big One" - a missile shaped like a penis.  After the history lesson, Fred accidentally meets and promptly falls in love with the nations female mascot, Liberty. Fred escapes the Comrades lair with Liberty. When theyre finally alone, Fred wishes to marry Liberty, but Liberty finds out that Freds married. Liberty is shocked and decides to return to the Comrade.
 horny for each other. While they have sex on the island, Fred tries to get back with Liberty, who still declines Freds offer, due to Fred still being married. Just then, Fred gets a message from his wife, who says that shes seeing another man, Freds Conan the Barbarian-like coworker. Fred and Liberty run toward each other with open arms. As they hug, the two bombs collide and explode in a cosmic orgasm. The entire universe is destroyed. God notices this and doesnt care. Fred and Liberty survive, and they both have sex in a lone cloud, beginning their new life together.

==Production==
After Tarzoon, la honte de la jungle and Le Cha√Ænon manquant, The Big Bang is the third feature by Picha, which includes Pichas typical devastating humor and his love of provocation and nonsense. Picha claims that the film is "the culmination of a trilogy, a mixture of these concerns in the other two films ... a little more tied to the news of the day, only more excessive. The Big Bang is a film about the all wars, including personal wars you find in the family."

Production lasted from 1984 to 1986. When the film was released in the UK, the British Board of Film Censors cut the film by 10 seconds to remove a sequence in which an animated version of God appeared to be having sex and then uttered an expletive. After the release of the film, Picha put his theatrical work on hold, choosing to produce television cartoons instead.

The film was released on DVD on 7 February 2011 in the United Kingdom by Lace DVD. There are currently no plans to release this film in North America.
