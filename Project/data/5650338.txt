The Heartbreak Kid is a 1993 Australian film starring Claudia Karvan and Alex Dimitriades, which was based on a play of the same name by Richard Barrett and first performed by Griffin Theatre Company. It was later spun off into the television series Heartbreak High.

==Plot==
Christina Papadopoulos (Claudia Karvan) is a sweet and well-meaning 22-year-old school teacher, engaged to ambitious lawyer Dimitri (Steve Bastoni). Christinas entire future seems planned out for her - albeit planned by her fiancé, her father and her priest.

Lively 17-year-old Nick Polides (Alex Dimitriades) is a student in Christinas class. Nick and Christina find themselves attracted to each other as both begin to rebel against the constricting Greek-Australian cultural restraints put upon them.

When Christina becomes the Coach of the schools soccer team, she and Nick begin to spend more time together outside of school hours. Soon their mutual attraction ignites into an illicit, passionate affair.
