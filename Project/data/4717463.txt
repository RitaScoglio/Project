 }}
 the 1955 novel by the same name written by Väinö Linna.

Mollberg used young and unknown actors, many of them now famous. The film was shot in color with much hand-held footage, attempting to portray the story more realistically than the prior Edvin Laine version. This has often lead to unfavourable comparisons with the better-known 1955 adaption. Although a full musical score was composed for the movie, Mollberg released the finished film without it for stylistic reasons.
 Best Foreign Language Film at the 59th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
