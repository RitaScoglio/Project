==Plot==
  best man) and begin living together.
 homophobic protesters, comes out to a very surprised Chuck. 
Larrys effeminate son, Eric is harassed in school by a homophobic bully but he surprises everybody by easily winning a fight with his abuser. During the ordeal, the previously homophobic pair come to understand what it is like to be persecuted and become more accepting of homosexuality.

Chuck becomes romantically interested in Alex after the two spend time together, but finds himself unable to get close to her because she thinks he is gay. Meanwhile, city agent Clinton Fitzer arrives to investigate the couple. The strain on both Larry and Chuck leads to a verbal fight and the two are assigned to work different shifts. In the meantime, a petition circulates to have Chuck and Larry thrown out of the firehouse. Discovery of the petition prompts Larry to confront the crew about their personal embarrassments on the job that Chuck and Larry helped them overcome. After the confrontation an emergency call comes into the fire station, and as they prepare to address the call, Larry reminds his coworkers that as a result of their harassment, he is no longer on duty. After Larrys shift is over, Chuck and Larry reconcile their differences.

Chuck and Alexs relationship grows as they spend time together, and they soon kiss. The kiss shocks Alex because she still believes Chuck is gay and married, making the interaction unacceptable from her point of view. Chuck tries to explain the situation and Alex kisses Chuck again but tells him they cannot see each other outside of their lawyer-client relationship. Alex says she believes in marriage and what it represents and that she has betrayed both him and Larry. Chuck attempts to explain but is unable to reveal the truth. Alex tells him to go, and he has no choice but to do so. Soon after, city agent Clinton Fitzer learns from Larrys children that Chuck has been spending time with Alex, whom he frequently talks about whenever Larry is not around. Fitzer appears shocked by this revelation.

Larry learns about the kiss and confronts Chuck about the amount of time he spends with Alex, asserting that Chucks absence is causing issues in their ability to maintain the ruse of their relationship. Soon Chuck and Larry begin to argue. Chuck is infuriated that he must live a lie to fulfill his promise to Larry, especially because of the predicament it causes for his desired intimacy with Alex. Hurt, Larry asks why Chuck could not have fun with him. Chuck accuses Larry of changing since they married, accusing him of not acting like a husband, and that Chuck feels like he is unable to breathe. Larry tries to reason with Chuck, saying he feels that way only because he is afraid of feeling trapped by the marriage. Chuck aggressively reminds Larry their marriage is a sham and declares the marriage a nightmare. Larry disparages Chucks ability to commit to anything and willingness to try to make the marriage work. Chuck then tells Larry to face the fact that they are not supposed to be together and that Larry needs to find a real relationship instead of being jealous about Chucks relationship with Alex. In response, Larry reveals he is still in love with his deceased wife Paula, to which Chuck responds that its time for Larry to move on for the sake of his kids. Despite the severity of the argument, Larry and Chuck soon reconcile their differences.
 platonic fashion). As his final demand, Fitzer asks for the pair to kiss to prove that their relationship is physical. Before they do so, Chuck and Larry are interrupted by Fire Department New York Captain Phineas J. Tucker, who finally reveals that their marriage is a sham and that they are both Heterosexuality|straight. Tucker attempts to save Chuck and Larry by claiming he would have to be arrested as well, since he knew about the falsity but failed to report it. This prompts the other firefighters to each claim a role in the wedding in a show of solidarity. Chuck, Larry, and the other firefighters are subsequently sent to jail, but they are quickly released after negotiating a deal to provide photos for an AIDS research benefit calendar. The deal included pleading guilty to fraud, which would reduce the charges to a misdemeanor.

Two months later, Duncan and Alexs brother, Kevin, are married in Canada at the same chapel as Chuck and Larry. At the wedding party, Larry finally moves on from the death of his wife and talks to a new woman, while Alex tentatively agrees to a dance with Chuck. The film ends when Lance Bass sings, and little Eric tap-dances.

===MPAA rating===
The film was originally rated R for "crude sexual humor and nudity". Universal appealed the rating, but it was upheld.  Upon losing the appeal, Universal edited the film and it was re-rated PG-13 for "crude sexual content throughout, nudity, language and drug references".

===Critical response=== film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 14% "Rotten" critic rating from 154 reviews; the consensus states: "Whether by way of inept comedy or tasteless stereotypes, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry falters on both levels." 

USA Today called it "a movie that gives marriage, homosexuality, friendship, firefighters, children and nearly everything else a bad name."  The Wall St Journal calls it "an insult to gays, straights, men, women, children, African-Americans, Asians, pastors, mailmen, insurance adjusters, firemen, doctors -- and fans of show music." 

The New York Post called it not an insult to homosexuality but to comedy itself.  The Miami Herald was slightly less critical, calling the film "funny in the juvenile, crass way we expect." 

Nathan Lee from the Village Voice wrote a positive review, praising the film for being "tremendously savvy in its stupid way" and "as eloquent as Brokeback Mountain, and even more radical."  Controversial critic Armond White championed the film as "a modern classic" for its "ultimate moral lessonâ€”that sexuality has absolutely nothing to do with who Chuck and Larry are as people". 

===Box office=== Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  By the end of its run, the film had grossed $120,059,556 domestically and $66,012,658 internationally for a worldwide total of $186,072,214.
