==Plot==
LAmour fou follows the dissolution of the marriage between Claire, an actress (played by Bulle Ogier), and Sebastien, her director (Jean-Pierre Kalfon). It is black and white with two different film gauges (35 mm and 16 mm) employed at different times throughout the film. The film focuses on a long cycle of self-destruction in Claire and Sebastiens relationship.

The central event in the films narrative is a three-week period of preparation by a theater group for a production of Jean Racine|Racines version of Andromaque.  A crew films the preparations of the theater company in handheld 16&nbsp;mm, while the rest of the film is shot in 35&nbsp;mm.  This framework allows Rivette to focus on the act of direction, in the formation of an artwork and the dissolution of a relationship.

The film is pivotal in Rivettes career as a precursor to his vast 12+ hour opus Out 1 which followed two years later.
