==Plot==
Lawrence Jamieson is an intelligent and sophisticated British con artist who operates in the French Riviera with the help of manservant Arthur and corrupt police official Andre. His signature con is seducing wealthy and morally suspect women and stealing their money. His only concern is a mysterious, anonymous con artist known only as "The Jackal" who has been preying on other wealthy victims of late.

When underachieving American hustler Freddy Benson decides to search for easy marks in Beaumont-sur-Mer, Lawrences home base, Lawrence believes that the Jackal has shown his face. Worried that Freddys inexperienced antics will scare away his prey, Lawrence has Freddy arrested and put on the next plane out of town. However, Freddy meets one of Lawrences former marks and deduces that the older man is also a crook.

Returning to Beaumont-sur-Mer, Freddy forces Lawrence to take him on as a pupil in exchange for his silence. Lawrence attempts to teach the impolite Freddy about high culture with limited success. He also involves him as a subordinate player in his cons, making him play the mentally challenged and socially inept Ruprecht in order to scare away their female targets after their money has been acquired. Freddy, tired of not getting paid and the humiliating part he has to play, decides to strike out on his own.  
 mark will psychosomatically crippled U.S. Army soldier (unable to walk after seeing his wife cheat on him with Dance U.S.A. host Deney Terrio) who needs to borrow $50,000 for treatment by the celebrated Liechtenstein psychiatrist, Dr. Emil Shaffhausen. But when Lawrence discovers this scheme he pretends to be Dr. Shaffhausen, insisting Freddys condition is one he can cure, with the stipulation that Janet pay the $50,000 fee directly to him.

Lawrence discovers that Janet is not wealthy after all but on vacation as a contest winner and that she intends to liquidate most of her assets to pay for Freddys treatment. Proud and sympathetically touched by Janets genuine kindness, Lawrence calls off the bet. Freddy agrees and now proposes a new bet; Janet herself, with the first to bed her declared the winner. Lawrence refuses to bed Janet, instead the bet will be whether or not Freddy can succeed, with Lawrence believing Freddy will fail.
 British sailors, Freddy waylays Lawrence, and rushes to Janets hotel room where he demonstrates his love by walking to her. However, Janet is not alone. Lawrence is present and declares Freddy cured of his ailment. Ushering Freddy out of the room he explains that the sailors released him after discovering that he is a Royal Navy Reserves officer. The sailors, angry at being duped by Freddy, keep him occupied at a party while Lawrence puts Janet on a plane to USA|America.  Despite his impending loss, Freddy becomes inebriated and enjoys the party greatly.

The next day however, Janet does not board her flight. She instead returns to her hotel room to find a repentant Freddy there. They kiss, close the door and begin to undress. The news reaches Lawrence as he swims, and he accepts his defeat with grace. He is later seen struggling to retain composure as he waits for Freddy to return and gloat over his victory. Instead, Janet arrives in tears. She tells him that Freddy has stolen the money her father sent. Lawrence compensates her with $50,000 of his own, calls Andre to have Freddy arrested, and takes her to the airport.

At the last minute before she boards the plane, Janet tells Lawrence that she cannot take the money and gives the bag back to him. As the plane leaves, the police arrive with Freddy, wearing nothing but a bathrobe, who claims that Janet robbed the both of them, including Freddys clothes. Puzzled, Lawrence opens up the bag and finds not the money he had given to Janet, but Freddys clothes and, underneath, a note from Janet admitting having taken the $50,000 and revealing herself to be the real Jackal. Freddy is furious while Lawrence is impressed.

One day, the following week, Freddy and Lawrence are at Lawrences villa looking back on their loss. They are about to part company when the Jackal, in a new disguise as a loud New York real estate developer, arrives in a yacht filled with wealthy people. She promptly has the shocked Lawrence and Freddy assume roles in her scheme and, after sending her guests off to refresh themselves, she takes the pair aside and announces that while she made three million dollars the previous year, "  fifty thousand was the most fun". Joining arms, they set out to fleece their latest victims.

==Release==

===Critical response===
 
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said, "The plot ... is not as complex as a movie like The Sting, and we can see some of the surprises as soon as they appear on the horizon. But the chemistry between Martin and Caine is fun, and Headly provides a resilient foil." 

Variety (magazine)|Variety called it "wonderfully crafted" and "absolutely charming" and added, "Director Frank Oz clearly has fun with his subjects, helped out in good part by clever cutting and a great, imitative 30s jazzy score by Miles Goodman." 

Vincent Canby of the "New York Times called it "one of the seasons most cheerful, most satisfying new comedies" which was a "blithe, seemingly all-new, laugh-out-loud escapade". He added that "Mr. Caine and Mr. Martin work together with an exuberant ease thats a joy to watch" plus "In this season of lazy, fat, mistimed and misdirected comedies, exemplified by Scrooged and Twins, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is an enchanted featherweight folly."
