}} animated Musical musical action action fantasy film written and directed by Jon Acevski. It is a parody of James Bond.  The film was inspired by bedtime stories Acevski told to his son about his favourite toy frog working as a secret agent.  

==Plot== Nessie (Phyllis Logan). As Messina departed, Nessies tail became trapped under a boulder. She befriended Frederic, who in turn used his powers to free her tail from the boulder. Nessie took him near dry land, and notes that if Frederic ever needed her, he would whistle. Frederic then leaped into the night sky, jumped through time zones until the late 20th century and fell into a swamp full of frogs, where he would spend the rest of his childhood in his new life as Freddie the Frog.

Freddie eventually grows up to become a member of the French secret service, known as F.R.O.7. and also has an anthropomorphic car (the reason for which is never explained). He is then called to London, England by the British Secret Service, as some major famous buildings in the United Kingdom are vanishing. By the time Freddie arrives as he left Paris, France. Nelsons Column, Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, St. Pauls Cathedral, and Stonehenge are already missing. Freddie meets the Brigadier G (Nigel Hawthorne), who seems to have trouble keeping himself and his comrades from getting tangled up in the phone cord. Freddie is introduced to Daffers (Jenny Agutter), an Englishwoman who is an expert in martial arts, and Scotty, a Scotsman who is an expert with weapons. Things take a turn for the worse as Canterbury Cathedral disappears. Freddie also meets Trilby, a sneaky member of the secret service.

During a trip to  .

Freddie and Scotty are thrown into a pool of sea monsters, while Daffers is taken to be brainwashed into a mindless follower of El Supremo and Messina. El Supremo uses the crystal to send his sleeping virus all across Great Britain and the whole country shuts down. Freddie whistles and Nessie appears to save them both from being devoured, and Scotty is saved from drowning. Nessie shows her family to Freddie, who then asks them to help defeat El Supremo by submerging the patrolling submarines. Freddie and Scotty save Daffers from the snake guards in disguise and the three return to stop El Supremo from conquering the world. They have to battle an army of soldiers, but in the process, Daffers and Scotty come too close to the crystals energy and fall unconscious. Freddie manages to infiltrate the crystals energy with his mind powers and destroys it, but also falls unconscious. El Supremo and Messina (who are preparing to attack their next target - The United States) arrive to kill Freddie, but he, Daffers and Scotty defeat El Supremo by shrinking him down to an ants size and trapping him in a matchbox.

A final battle then ensues between Freddie and Messina, who attacks by shape-shifting consecutively into a bat, hyena, scorpion, and boa. As Messina begins to crush Freddie in her boa form, Freddie remembers comforting words from his late father and finds the strength to escape and toss Messina into an electrical pole high up. Messina is then turned into a buzzard and vows to get revenge on Freddie one day before fleeing. Brigadier G and his team arrive in time, and Trilby is discovered to be a spy for the villains. Britain is restored to normal and Freddie heads off to deal with some bad guys in the United States.

==Production==
 
The film was inspired by bedtime stories Acevski told to his son about his favourite toy frog working as a secret agent.

==Release==
Miramax Films purchased the film for distribution in North America. A week after its UK release, the film was released on August 28, 1992 in 1,257 theatres. It was released with a PG rating, an incredibly uncommon move for an animated feature at the time. It was also released theatrically in Spain during the 1992 Christmas season. A contributing factor to its failure was that animated features produced by independent companies, in this case Hollywood Road Film Productions, tended to be commercial disappointments at the time while Disney was at its peak with its new releases. Hollywood Road Film, and other studios like Sullivan Bluth Studios, couldnt compete with the universal acclaim of Disney and their animated pictures.

This film also has a very small cult following.

===Alternate Versions===
In 1995, MCA/Universal Home Video released the film on home video under an alternate re-edited version, under the title of Freddie the Frog with new narration from James Earl Jones. Odds and ends (including moments of conversation) were cut and sequences were re-edited, supposedly in the hope to make the film easier to follow. Potentially racially sensitive elements were removed or changed, like the KKK-members and Nazi axis-like soldiers during the "Evilmainya" song sequence and the tourist and punk crows were re-dubbed.

===Home media===
It is still a very little known animated film, which to this date has never been released on DVD in the original 1992 UK version nor the 1995 US re-edit (although copies of the 1995 re-edit are known to exist in the Netherlands and Hungary).

==Reception== Variety said, "A shake ‘n’ bake mixture of virtually every toon genre going, it makes up in energy what it lacks in originality".  "The movie, which bills itself as the most ambitious animated film ever to come out of Britain, is a convoluted adventure story that swirls classic fairy-tale mythology together with modern pop-cultural iconography into an unwieldy hodgepodge," said Stephen Holden of The New York Times. 

===Box Office=== The Ten Commandments, which grossed $952,820 in 830 theatres (and also had Ben Kingsley) and Delgo (film)|Delgo ($694,782 / 2,160 theatres) have grossed less than F.R.O.7.

==Cancelled sequel==
A sequel, intitled Freddie Goes to Washington, was already placed into production just as the film was being released. Due to the disastrous critical and financial performance of the film, production was cancelled and no other information of Washington exists outside of virally shared pencil tests.
