 1952 American movie of the same name, this film is sometimes referred to as Howard Hawks Monkey Business.

==Plot==
  elixir of youth.  He is urged on by his commercially minded boss, Oliver Oxly (Charles Coburn). One of Dr. Fultons chimpanzees, Esther, gets loose in the laboratory, mixes a beaker of chemicals, and pours the mix into the water cooler. The chemicals have the rejuvenating effect Fulton is seeking. 

Unaware of Esthers antics, Fulton tests his latest experimental concoction on himself and washes it down with water from the cooler. He soon begins to act like a 20-year-old and spends the day out on the town with his bosss secretary, Lois Laurel (Marilyn Monroe). When Fultons wife, Edwina (Ginger Rogers), learns that the elixir "works", she drinks some along with water from the cooler and turns into a prank-pulling schoolgirl. 

Edwina makes an impetuous phone call to her old flame, the family lawyer, Hank Entwhistle (Hugh Marlowe). Her mother, who knows nothing of the elixir, believes that Edwina is truly unhappy in her marriage and wants a divorce. 

Barnaby takes more elixir and befriends a group of kids playing as make-believe Indians.  They capture and "scalp" Hank (giving him a Mohawk hairstyle). Meanwhile, Edwina lies down to sleep off the formula. When she awakens, a naked baby is next to her plus Barnabys clothes are nearby so she presumes he has taken too much formula and regressed to a baby. She takes the child to Oxly to resolve the problem.

Meanwhile, more and more scientists (and Mr Oxly) at the laboratory are drinking the water and reverting to a second childhood. The formula is lost with the last of the water poured away.

The parting adage is "youre old only when you forget youre young."

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Hawks said he did not think the films premise was believable, and as a result thought the film was not as funny as it could have been. Peter Bogdanovich has noted that the scenes with Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe work especially well and laments that Monroe was not the leading lady instead of Ginger Rogers. However, Gregory Lamb of The Christian Science Monitor described Rogers as "a comedienne par excellence" in the film. 

==Note on opening credits==
The voice telling Grant "Not yet, Cary" during the opening credits is indeed Hawks. It may be the only time his voice was heard in one of his own pictures.
