Midway, released in the United Kingdom as Battle of Midway and in the US on video as The Battle of Midway,  is a 1976 Technicolor war film directed by Jack Smight and produced by 
Walter Mirisch from a screenplay by Donald S. Sanford.     The film features an international cast of stars including Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Hal Holbrook, Toshiro Mifune, Robert Mitchum, Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner, James Shigeta, Pat Morita, Robert Ito and Christina Kokubo, among others.

The music score by John Williams and the cinematography by Harry Stradling, Jr. were both highly regarded.  The soundtrack used Sensurround to augment the physical sensation of engine noise, explosions, crashes and gunfire.

==Plot==
The film chronicles the Battle of Midway, a turning point in World War II in the Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Navy had been undefeated until that time and out-numbered the American naval forces by four to one.
 interned with her parents. Captain Garth calls in all of his favors with a long-time friend to investigate the charges against the Sakuras. He apparently has some success, as Haruko is free and at dockside when the injured younger Garth is carried off the ship at the end of the film, while Captain Garth himself was killed at the end of the battle when his plane crashed.
 Midway Island Chester Nimitz (Henry Fonda), plays a desperate gamble by sending his last remaining aircraft carriers to Midway before the Japanese to set up his own ambush.

Successful in saving Midway, but at a heavy cost, Nimitz reflects that Yamamoto "had everything going for him", asking "were we better than the Japanese, or just luckier?"

The film was shot at the Terminal Island Naval Base, Los Angeles, California, the U.S. Naval Station, Long Beach, California and Pensacola, Florida. The on-board scenes were filmed in the Gulf of Mexico aboard the  . The Lexington, an  , was the last World War II-era carrier left in service at that point, although the ship was completed after the battle. She is now a museum ship at Corpus Christi, Texas.

Scenes depicting Midway Island were filmed at Point Mugu, California. "Point Mugu has sand dunes, just like Midway. We built an airstrip, a tower, some barricades, things like that," said Jack Smight. "We did a lot of strafing and bombing there." 

A PBY Catalina|PBY-6A Catalina BuNo 63998, N16KL, of the Commemorative Air Force, was used in depicting all the search and rescue mission scenes.

It was the second of only four films released with a Sensurround sound mix which required special speakers to be installed in movie theatres. The other Sensurround films were Earthquake (film)|Earthquake (1974), Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster (1977), and Battlestar Galactica (1978). The regular soundtrack (dialog, background and music) was monaural; a second optical track was devoted to low frequency rumble added to battle scenes and when characters were near unmuffled military engines.

In the TV version of the film Susan Sullivan appears playing Matt Garths girlfriend. Later video versions dropped Sullivan to emphasize the essentially all-male cast and wartime action.

As with many "carrier films" produced around this time, the US Navy Essex class aircraft carrier USS Lexington played the parts of both American and Japanese flattops for shipboard scenes.

==Reception==
Robert Niemi, author of History in the Media: Film and Television, stated that Midways "clichéd dialogue" and an overuse of stock footage led the film to have a "shopworn quality that signalled the end of the heroic era of American-made World War II epics." He described the film as a "final, anachronistic attempt to recapture World War II glories in a radically altered geopolitical era, when the old good-versus-evil dichotomies no longer made sense." 

Later studies by Japanese and American military historians call into question key scenes, like the dive-bombing attack that crippled the first Japanese carrier, the Akagi.  In the movie, American pilots report, "Theyve got bombs all over their flight deck!  We caught em flat-footed! No fighters and a deck full of bombs!"  As Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully write in "Shattered Sword" (2005) that aerial photography shows nearly empty decks.  In addition, Japanese carriers loaded armament onto planes below the flight deck, unlike American carriers.  The fact that a closed hangar full of armaments was hit by bombs made damage to Akagi more devastating than if planes, torpedoes and bombs were on an open deck.

In June 1992, a re-edit of the extended version, shortened to fill a three-hour time slot, aired on the CBS network to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Midway battle. This version brought in successful ratings. 

Part of this additional footage is available as a bonus feature on the Universal Pictures Home Entertainment DVD of Midway.
