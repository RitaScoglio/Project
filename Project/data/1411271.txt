==Synopsis==
The film relates a historical case of alleged identity theft. Martin Guerre leaves his young wife in a small French village to go fight in a war, and to travel. Many years later, an older man (played by Depardieu) claiming to be Martin returns to resume his life.

As time passes, the villagers grow suspicious that he is an impostor, and he is put on  trial, with his life at stake.
