Safety Last! is a 1923 romantic   above moving traffic. The film was highly successful and critically hailed, and it cemented Lloyds status as a major figure in early motion pictures.  It is still popular at revivals, and it is viewed today as one of the great film comedies. 

The films title is a play on the common expression, "safety first," which places safety as the primary priority to avoid accidents. Lloyd performed some of his climbing stunts despite losing a thumb and forefinger in an accident while making a film four years earlier.

==Plot== trackside pickup hoop used by train crews to receive orders without stopping, and the bars are merely the ticket barrier. He promises to send for his girlfriend so they can get married once he has "made good" in the big city. Then he is off.

He gets a job as a salesclerk at the De Vore Department Store, where he has to pull various stunts to get out of trouble with the picky head floorwalker, Mr. Stubbs. He shares a rented room with his pal "Limpy" Bill, a construction worker.
 PINCH YOU!"

Meanwhile, Harold has been hiding his lack of success by sending his girlfriend expensive presents he cannot really afford. She mistakenly thinks he is successful enough to support a family and, with his mothers encouragement, takes a train to join him. In his embarrassment, he has to pretend to be the general manager, even succeeding in impersonating him to get back at Stubbs. While going to retrieve her purse (which Mildred left in the managers office), he overhears the real general manager say he would give $1,000 to anyone who could attract people to the store. He remembers Bills talent and pitches the idea of having a man climb the "International Savings & Exchange Bank Building|12-story Bolton building", which De Vores occupies. He gets Bill to agree to do it by offering him $500. The stunt is highly publicized and a large crowd gathers the next day.

When a drunkard shows "The Law" (the policeman who was pushed over) a newspaper story about the event, the lawman suspects Bill is going to be the climber. He waits at the starting point despite Harolds frantic efforts to get him to leave. Finally, unable to wait any longer, Bill suggests Harold climb the first story himself and then switch his hat and coat with Bill, who will continue on from there. After Harold starts up, the policeman spots Bill and chases him into the building. Every time Harold tries to switch places with Bill, the policeman appears and chases Bill away. Each time, Bill tells his friend he will meet him on the next floor up. Eventually, Harold reaches the top, despite his troubles with a clock and some hungry pigeons, and kisses his girl. She continues to believe that hes general manager of De Vore.

==References in popular culture==
In 1962, the "dangling from the skyscraper" scene was included in Harold Lloyds World of Comedy,  a compilation movie produced by Harold Lloyd himself. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and created a renewal of interest in the comedian by introducing him to a whole new generation.
 Time on My Hands" features men hanging precariously from the hands of a clock tower.

In the 1983 martial arts film Project A, Jackie Chan also played an homage to Lloyd (whom he has frequently cited as an influence on his work) by falling from a clock tower.
 homage to the Harold Lloyd "dangling from the skyscraper" by having one of the films stars Christopher Lloyd (no relation to Harold) hang from a clock tower as part of the plot.  The dangling scene was also alluded to earlier in the film during the pan of Doc Browns (Christopher Lloyds character) laboratory as a picture is shown featuring Lloyd hanging from a clock tower.  In addition, a meta-reference appears in the opening scene of Back to the Future, in the form of a physical table clock which depicts the Safety Last! scene.

The 1991 comedy film Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar played a direct homage to the scene, recreating it on its poster, where the main character (played by Sylvester Stallone) hangs from a clock.

In Martin Scorseses 2011 film Hugo (film)|Hugo, a portion of the scene with Lloyd hanging from the clock is shown when the main characters sneak into a movie theater. Later, the title character Hugo similarly hangs from the hands of a large clock on a clock tower to escape a pursuer.
