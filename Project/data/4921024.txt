After witnessing the murder of his wife and young son at the hands of Henry Caine (Craig Fairbrass), who then turned the gun on himself, Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) is so distressed that he attempts to take his own life.  A near-death experience follows that leaves Abe with the ability to identify those who are about to die.  He acts on these premonitions to save three people from death, among them a nurse met during his recovery, Sherry Clarke (Katee Sackhoff).
 possessed and compelled to take the lives of others.  Accepting this responsibility, Abe comes to terms with the horrible fact that he must consider killing those he had saved to prevent further tragedy.

Abe tries unsuccessfully to prevent the second man he saved from killing others, but arrives just a minute too late. Abe is able however to take the gun from the man before he kills himself. Abe tries to explain the situation to Sherry but she is at first non-receptive and he must follow her to the cafe his wife and son were murdered in. This time Sherry listens but, just as Abe brings up the gun, police who are already in the cafe shoot him dead. Abe spends his last minutes trying to convince Sherry she must kill herself before her own possession is complete. However, as she reaches for the gun the police pick it up and she is put into an ambulance.

In the ambulance Sherry struggles against the demons inside her and Abe is able to comfort her and help her pass on so as to keep her from causing any harm to a crowded bus that is stopped by an 18-wheeler transporting gas . At the last minute Abe appears outside the ambulance causing the driver to swerve and miss the tanker, thus saving everyone else. Abe finally sees the white light and his family waiting in the distance and is able to move on. Back at Blackmount countys asylum, Henry is tormented and driven further insane by the restless spirits of all the victims who died at the hands of people he saved.
