Vengeful, Kenai heads out to avenge Sitka. He chases the bear up onto a mountain and kills it.

Guilty and horrified, Kenai runs away, but Koda soon finds him. Kenai reveals the truth to Koda, who runs away, grief-stricken. An apologetic Kenai leaves to reach the mountain. Rutt and Tuke, having fallen out, reform their brotherhood in front of Koda, prompting him to go after Kenai. Denahi confronts Kenai on the mountain, but their fight is interrupted by Koda, who steals Denahis hunting pike. Kenai goes to Kodas aid out of love, prompting Sitka to appear and turn him back into a human, much to Denahi and Kodas surprise. However, Kenai asks Sitka to transform him back into a bear so he can stay with Koda.

In the end, Kenai lives with the rest of the bears and gains his title as a man, through being a bear.

==Production==
In 2002, Digital Media Effects reported the title of the film as Bears.  An article in IGN in 2001 also mentioned an upcoming Disney release with the title Bears  as did Jim Hill of Aint It Cool News. 

=== Design and animation === Background supervisor Barry Kooser and his team traveled to Jackson Hole, Wyoming and studied with Western landscape painter Scott Christensen, where they learned to: "simplify objects by getting the spatial dimensions to work first and working in the detail later."

According to Ruben Aquino, supervising animator for the character of Denahi, Denahi was originally meant to be Kenais father; later this was changed to Kenais brother.  Byron Howard, supervising animator for Kenai in bear form, said that earlier in production a bear named Grizz (who resembles Tug in the film and is even voiced by the same person) was supposed to have the role of Kenais mentor.    Art Director Robh Ruppel stated that the ending of the film originally showed how Kenai and Denahi get together once a year to play when the northern lights are in the sky.
