Bugs Bunny: Superstar is a 1975 Looney Tunes documentary film, narrated by Orson Welles and produced and directed by Larry Jackson. It was the first documentary to examine the history of the Warner Bros. cartoons, and includes nine Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons which were previously released during the 1940s (and thus, it can also be considered to be an anthology film):

* Whats Cookin Doc? (1944), directed by Bob Clampett
* The Wild Hare (a.k.a. A Wild Hare) (1940), directed by Tex Avery
* A Corny Concerto (1943), directed by Bob Clampett
* I Taw a Putty Tat (1948), directed by Friz Freleng
* Rhapsody Rabbit (1946), directed by Friz Freleng
* Walky Talky Hawky (1946), directed by Robert McKimson
* My Favorite Duck (1942), directed by Chuck Jones
* Hair-Raising Hare (1946), directed by Chuck Jones
* The Old Grey Hare (1944), directed by Bob Clampett

Bugs Bunny: Superstar also includes interviews with some legendary  ,  , Mel Blanc, and Chuck Jones for the film, but all three were ultimately not involved, for various reasons. 

The documentary infuriated many of the Warner Bros. artists, as Clampett liberally took credit for many of the Warners creations. Clampett implies that he was the creator of Bugs Bunny, claiming that he used Clark Gables carrot-eating scene in It Happened One Night as inspiration for the character. Furthermore, Clampett takes credit for drawing the model sheet for the first Porky Pig cartoon, I Havent Got a Hat (1935), even though it was actually drawn by Friz Freleng. Subsequently, Chuck Jones, who already had a strong dislike for Clampett, left out Clampetts name in the 1979 compilation film The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie when Bugs discusses his fathers (where Chuck and other Warners directors were being listed), and his 1989 autobiography Chuck Amuck.

Bugs Bunny: Superstar was the first of a series of Warner cartoon compilation movies released in the 1970s and 1980s. However, as a documentary, it does not fit the mould of the totally animated Warner Bros. compilation movies that began with 1979s   and then Turner Entertainment Co.

== Availability ==

Bugs Bunny: Superstar was first released in theaters in late 1975. It was also available on laserdisc and VHS format during the late 1980s but both versions had been discontinued since 1999.
 
It was re-released on  . Most of the cartoons were previously released as separate, refurbished entries in the DVD collection. This film is presented pretty much "as is", unrestored with some age-wear apparent here and there. Most of the prints of the cartoons used were the Turner "dubbed versions", replacing the original prints from the 1975 release. The Old Grey Hare on the DVD used an original a.a.p. print (as part of the a.a.p. open soundtrack can be heard at the beginning of that cartoon) to preserve the final gag involving the "Thats all, Folks" title card, which was lost in the Turner dubbed version of that cartoon. I Taw a Putty Tat is the other that was sourced from an a.a.p. print as the Turner dubbed version, which  has an edit to remove a blackface gag. As of 2014,  Whats Cookin Doc? and I Taw a Putty Tat are the only two cartoons from this film that have not been restored and remastered by Warner Bros. to be independently released on DVD.

On November 15, 2012, Warner Home Video released the documentary on DVD as part of the Warner Archive Collection.
