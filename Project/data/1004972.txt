Black Sabbath ( ) is a 1963 Italian-French horror film directed by Mario Bava. The film is centered on three separate tales that have an introduction and conclusion from Boris Karloff. The film stars an international cast in three short stories. The first, titled "The Telephone", involves Suzy (Michèle Mercier) who continually receives threatening telephone calls from an unseen stalker. The second is "The Wurdulak", where a man named Gorca (Karloff) returns to his family after claiming to have slain a Wurdulak, an undead creature who attacks those that it had once loved. The third story, "The Drop of Water", features Jacqueline Pierreux as Helen Corey who steals a ring from a corpse that is being prepared for burial and finds herself haunted by the rings original owner after arriving home.

Black Sabbath follows the 1960s trend of Italian film productions, being a low budget horror anthology film with an international cast. The film is credited to various authors but is predominantly based on several uncredited sources. Several changes were made to the script even after the film had gone into production. American International Pictures suggested changes to Mario Bava during filming to make the film acceptable for the American target audience. The company created their own English language dub of the film that removed scenes involving violence and re-edited certain scenes. This version greatly changed the plot of "The Telephone", giving it a supernatural story element and removing any reference to lesbianism or prostitution.
 Time Out magazine conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors, and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Black Sabbath placed at number 73.

Rosy (Michele Mercier), a French call-girl, returns to her basement apartment at night. She receives a series of strange phone calls.

Rosy phones Mary (Lydia Alfonsi) for solace. The women have been estranged, but Rosy is certain that only Mary can help her. Mary agrees to come over that night. Seconds later, Frank calls again, promising that no matter what Rosy does he will have his revenge. Rosy doesnt realize that Mary is impersonating Frank on the telephone. Mary arrives at Rosys apartment and attempts to calm Rosys nerves.  Mary provides Rosy with a large knife for protection before she goes to sleep.

As Rosy sleeps, Mary writes a confession explaining that she made the calls to force a reunion, knowing that Rosy would call on her for help. While she is writing, an intruder enters the apartment. The intruder is Frank, who strangles Mary. The sound of their struggle awakens Rosy, and Frank realizes he murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosys bed, but she seizes her knife and stabs Frank. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.

=== "The Wurdalak" ===
In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe ( ). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the Wurdulac|wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivans corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.

That same night, their child appears outside and begs to be invited in. Giorgio is stabbed by his wife while she attempts to let in her son. On opening the door, she is greeted by Gorca who bites her. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from their home and hide in the ruins of a cathedral. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka walks outside and finds Gorca and his family surrounding her. Vladimir awakens and searches for Sdenka, finding her lying motionless in her bed at home. Sdenka awakens and upon receiving Vladimirs embrace, she bites into his neck.

=== "The Drop of Water" ===
In London, England, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) is called to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a sapphire ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over a glass of water which drips on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the womans corpse lying in her bed. It rises and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chesters body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.

The camera than pans back revealing he is on a stuffed horse revealing the studio set and simulated effects. 

===Post-production===
 
By the 1960s, Italian horror films such as Black Sabbath were more violent, sexualized and downbeat than the horror films created in America.  American International Pictures focused on a youth-oriented audience whereas horror in Europe was intended for adults. Heffernan, 2004. p. 142  {{Cite AV media notes

The company re-arranged the order of the stories to start with "The Drop of Water", followed by "The Telephone" and then "The Wurdalak".  Changes were then made the plots with the most extensively edited being "The Telephone".  "The Telephone" removes any suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Rosy and Mary and references to prostitution.  The character of Frank is also no longer a pimp but a ghost who leaves behind enchanted notes that magically write themselves as soon as the envelope they are contained in is opened.  {{Cite AV media notes

}}  Both the Italian and English language films have a different look. Bava supervised the Italian language version at Technicolor Roma under his own supervision while American International Pictures shipped their version to Pathé Color for processing.  Mario Bava biographer Tim Lucas described the English language print as looking "warmer, but less nuanced, with flatter tonalities" and that it "doesnt look bad" but that the Italian version "looks more vibrant, more flamboyantly nightmarish".

Arrow noted the high definition master they received from Italy was very difficult to restore as the master had issues with the image, sound and color quality and had the stories in the wrong order. 

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review of the American International Pictures edit, The Globe and Mail stated that "The Drop of Water" and "The Telephone" were "a good deal more sophisticated than usual horror fare" while "The Wurdulak" "bears no trace of   manner of directing" and that the acting was "rudimentary".  The Boston Globe gave the film a negative review, referring to the Black Sabbath as "three short films botched together". 
 Time Out Time Out compared the film to anthology horror films made by the British production company Amicus noting that "If only Amicus...had taken heed they might have got some ideas as to what can be done with the format." 
Entertainment Weekly awarded the film an A- rating referring to it as "excellent" and that the stories were "composed of three tales of expertly building suspense" 
 Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films.  Black Sabbath placed at number 73 on their top list. 

==Influence and aftermath==
 
Boris Karloff enjoyed working with Bava on Black Sabbath and he praised his work to both Christopher Lee and Vincent Price who would later go on to work with Bava in The Whip and the Body and Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs respectively. {{cite AV media

The English music group Black Sabbath appropriate their name from the film.  Originally known as Earth, the group wanted to change their name as another group had the same name.  The group saw a local cinema playing Black Sabbath and marveled that people paid money to be frightened. Froese, 2012. p. 30  

Directors Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino were influenced by Black Sabbaths story structure for their original script for Pulp Fiction (1994). Bailey, 2012. p.32  The film was originally going to be three short films with each one being directed by Avary, Tarantino and another unknown director.  Bailey, 2012. p.33  Tarantino originally described this idea by stating that "what Mario Bava did with the horror film in Black Sabbath, I was gonna do with the crime film."
