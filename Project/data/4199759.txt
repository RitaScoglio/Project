Mansai Nomura is a famous kyogen actor, a type of traditional theater related to noh but of a more comic nature, and this role is considered something of a big transition for him.  His portrayal of Abe no Seimei has been described as including a number of foxy looks, perhaps in acknowledging the folklore describing Abe no Seimeis mother as a kitsune.  The lead actress, Eriko Imai, a pop singer, has very few lines and little involvement with the plot. The film was a commercial success grossing ¥3,010,000,000 ($36,567,313) becoming the 4th highest earning Japanese production of 2001.  The film was also giving a limited theater release in North America where it grossed $16,234 in 3 theaters. 

A sequel, Onmyouji 2, appeared in 2003.  Both movies are based on the Onmyouji novels by Baku Yumemakura, which also inspired a manga series by Reiko Okano.
