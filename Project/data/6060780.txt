The films release was met by protests from Sikh groups, who took offense at its use of a Sikh religious phrase as its title,  as well as scenes in which a Sikh police officer is shown being chased by scantily-clad women . Two bomb attacks on 22 May 2005 on theatres in New Delhi showing the film killed one person and injured 49, prompting cinema owners to pull the film, in some cases voluntarily and in some states as a result of a government order.

Meanwhile, Romeo has taken his merciless campaign to New York. Intelligence reports reveal that Romeo has entered the US in a plot to kill the President. Now, FBI are desperate to find Romeo, but the villain is a man without a face and therefore invisible. The only person who knows what the menace looks like is Nihaal Singh.
