}} French silent film that was produced and released in 1903 in film|1903. As such, it is one of the earliest feature film|feature-length narrative films. 

The film, with sequences made in the stencil color process Pathéchrome, takes a straightforward approach to its subject matter. All scenes are introduced by an intertitle giving the traditional name of the event (the Annunciation, the Nativity of Jesus|Nativity, etc.) followed by the actors playing out the familiar stories from the Gospels. Other than the scene titles, there are no other inter-titles.

In 1932, the film was re-issued in the U.S., distributed on a states-rights basis. Instead of the stencil coloring effect, however, the film was printed on red-tinted stock, with a musical score by James C. Bradford.

Its original French title was La Vie et la passion de Jésus Christ (The Life and the passion of Jesus Christ).
