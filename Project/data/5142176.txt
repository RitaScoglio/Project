Stiffy is a 2005 short film directed by Jacqueline Wright and written by and starring Alice Lowe. It also stars Steve Oram and James Bachman. "Stiffy" subverts the taboo of necrophilia by depicting a hospital orderly falling in love with a corpse and then courting it with old-fashioned romance.

"Stiffy" was one of the winners of "Straight 8", a competition which states that all entries must be filmed on 8&nbsp;mm, with single takes for each shot and no editing. "Stiffy" was screened at the Cannes Film Festival 2005.
