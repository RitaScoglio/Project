== Plot ==
Binta is a young African girl who serves as the narrator.  She talks about her father and his great idea.  Bintas father is a small-time, local fisherman in  a peaceful village (near the town of Bignona) in Senegal.  His friend who recently visited Europe describes what fishing is like there.  He tells him that the Europeans can catch thousands of fish with bigger boats equipped with sonar.  The man, very impressed by this, encourages the father to approach the government and request a permit for a bigger boat.  Bintas father also hears from his friend how once he attains wealth he must get a permit for a weapon so he can defend his wealth.  The friend also shows off his watch which has an alarm set to ring every day at noon.  "What happens at noon?" asks Bintas father.  "Why, the alarm rings!" his friend replies.

Bintas father is shown making his way up through the ranks of government, sharing his great idea with various officials.  The film switches back and forth between the story of Binta and her father and the struggle between Bintas cousin, Soda, and her father, a village elder. Soda desperately wants to go to school, but her father believes African girls should not be educated; they should learn to tend the home and then get married and tend to home and family.

The village school children put on a play to convince Sodas father to let her attend school.  Here we experience the power of art and solidarity; in the end, the father is finally convinced, and Soda is allowed to get an education.

Finally, when Bintas father meets with the provincial leader, we find out what his great idea was:  He wants do his part to make the world a better place by adopting a tubab (white child), "preferably weaned," in order to teach him/her qualities which Western industrialized society has largely lost, such as sharing, solidarity, the sustainable use of resources.  This film is unusual in that it allows us a glimpse of Western culture as viewed from a third world perspective.

The film references a range of themes such as sexism, African Time, change through art, sustainability and equitable division of resources, and a possible path for progress and humanity.
