==Plot==
After one book that ended up in the remainder bins, novelist Byron Tillers inability to pay the bills strains relations with his wife. Desperate for any kind of income, he meets Luther Fox, an Englishman who runs an exclusive escort service called Elysian Fields, and is offered a job.

Hiding his new employment from his wife, Byron finds that one of his clients, Andrea, is married to a much-older, ill Pulitzer Prize-winning author whom Tiller greatly admires. Complications develop as he develops a relationship with the author, essentially cowriting his latest book.
