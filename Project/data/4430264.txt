The Best Intentions ( ) is a 1992 Swedish drama film directed by Bille August and written by Ingmar Bergman. It is semi-autobiographical and tells the story of the complex courtship of Bergmans parents, Erik and Karin (who are renamed Henrik and Anna in the film but retain the "real" surnames), and the difficult early years of their marriage, up to the point where Anna is pregnant with their second son, effectively Bergman himself. The film won the Palme dOr at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.

The film is a cut-down version of a four-part Swedish television series. The theatrical version was released as a Region 2 DVD in April 2010 and as a Region 1 DVD in 2011.

Although Henrik has a relationship with the waitress Frida, he falls in love with Ernsts sister Anna Åkerblom. Annas family doesnt consider him fit to join the family, so he stays with Frida. Some years later Annas father is deceased, Anna suffers with tuberculosis and Henrik has accomplished his studies. Now the wedding can take place.
