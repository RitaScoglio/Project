}} Richard Franklin, and starring Max Gillies as Deadeye Dick and Serge Lazareff as Mexico Pete. The film was the first film produced by Richard Franklin.
 Ballad of Eskimo Nell, which had actually been banned in Australia, with Deadeye Dick and Mexico Pete setting forth through the Australian Outback in search of the infamous prostitute, Eskimo Nell.

The film features large amounts of full frontal nudity which was one of the main attractions of the film at the time. 

The film was part of the Australian New Wave, with most of the film being shot in Ballarat and some in Canada.

==Plot==
The films unlikely protagonist is a mild-mannered window peeper named Dead-Eye Dick (Max Gillies). Dick spies on a Mexican couple. The husband is very jealous and is about to discover that his wife has a lover when Dick rescues the lover, whose moniker is Mexico Pete (Serge Lazareff). The worldly Pete counsels the shy Dick on his problems approaching women. Dick claims that hes waiting for an Alaskan Eskimo named Nell. Pete and Dick decide to travel to Alaska to find this fantasy woman, and they have several wacky misadventures along the way.

==Development==
Franklin says he got the idea to make the film when he was in Sydney producing The Jumping Jeweller of Lavender Bay and heard a tape recorded version of the poem Eskimo Nell. He thought it would make a great movie and several months later wrote a treatment. Gordon Glenn & Scott Murray, "Richard Franklin", Cinema Papers, July 1974 p246-248 
 Ice Palace (1960) and Ice Station Zebra (1968).  He also discovered that the poem was not well known in the US. "Its known only in the English World, meaning Canada, Australia and England," said the director.   accessed 15 October 2012  

Franklin returned home, then released he could set the story just as easily in the Australian goldfields:
 There was the desire to assert the Australian vernacular and thereby have a bit of lavatory humour in it, but at the same time I think, as opposed to Alvin and Barry McKenzie, to give a sense of our culture and history in terms of mateship. But basically it was designed to shock and, in retrospect, its probably a bit tame.  
Franklin pitched the idea of the film to the Australian Film Development Corporation who at first rejected it, but then he re-pitched the project with a series of stills he had taken at Sovereign Hill. They gave him some development money and put him in contact with screenwriter Alan Hopgood. David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p249  According to Franklin, Hopgood mostly concentrated on the dialogue, while Franklin worked on structure.  The AFDC were impressed by the second draft and agreed to help finance.

==Production==
Eventually the AFDC provided $105,000, with additional funds from the distributor Filmways and some private investment. 
 Jack Thompson, to play the leads. Gillies accepted but Thompson wasnt not available so Serge Lazareff was cast instead. 

The film was shot in mid 1974 in rural Victoria, including Sovereign Hill and in an improvised studio in the Exhibition Building, Melbourne. A smaller unit shot some additional footage in Canada, including a scene involving pursuit on ice floes which was a homage to Way Down East. Most of this sequence was re shot in Melbourne. 

==Release==
The film received much criticism from conservative groups such as the Festival of LIght who claimed that government funds were being used to produce pornography.  Franklin:
 The theatres were picketed, and it was actually fairly successful in terms of damaging the picture. I thought it would be great publicity, but the one thing people dont want to hear is that tax dollars have been wasted. The minute they hear that, theyre less inclined to throw good money after bad, if you see what I mean. So the film was not successful.  
A British film based on the same poem, Eskimo Nell, was made around the same time. Its release in Australia was delayed until 1976 and its title changed to The Sexy Saga of Naughty Nell and big Dick. 

The movie was not a commercial success, despite being re cut for its Sydney release and helped lead to the demise of the Australian "ocker sex comedy" cycle.  "It was an attempt to do something kind of poignant," says Franklin. "In retrospect it probably should have been funnier than it was."  However Antony I. Ginnane worked on the overseas marketing of the film, starting his relationship with Richard Franklin. 

Richard Franklin admitted the movie changed what sort of movies he made:
 One of the great disappointments for me, and I learned a lot from it, was showing it to my American friends - probably at the time we were there making Fantasm - and discovering they just didnt get the humour. That it was a kind of humour that didnt really travel well. They admired the filmmaking, they admired the craft, but they didnt laugh at any of the jokes. So the pathos and so on, which was really derived spiritually for me from Midnight Cowboy, worked, but not the comedy. And so my next film, using a lot of the same financiers, was an attempt to make a universal genre film.
